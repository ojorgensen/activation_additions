       "[\"The Hull-Ottawa fire of 1900 was a devastating fire in 1900 that destroyed much of Hull, Quebec, and large portions of Ottawa, Ontario. On April 26 a defective chimney on a house in Hull caught fire, which quickly spread between the wooden houses due to windy conditions.[1] Along the river were the large lumber companies, and huge amounts of stacked lumber that quickly ignited.[2]\\n\\nTwo thirds of Hull was destroyed, including 40 per cent of its residential buildings and most of its largest employers along the waterfront. The fire also spread across the Ottawa River, carried by wind borne embers and destroyed a large swath of western Ottawa from the Lebreton Flats south to Dow's Lake. About one fifth of Ottawa was destroyed [3] with almost everything in the band between Booth Street and the rail line levelled.\\n\\nPrevailing wind patterns and the higher elevation of central Ottawa prevented the fire from spreading east. The fire break created by the rail line also preserved the Hintonburg area. The fire engines 'The Conqueror' and 'La France' had to be abandoned to the flames, and the call went out to five communities for assistance in fighting the blaze, including Montreal and Toronto. Montreal was able to send a fire engine by rail, which arrived in less than two hours. Dynamiting houses to block the fire's spread was considered, but this plan was rejected in view of the danger that falling debris from the blast would only spread the conflagration further.[4]\\n\\nExtent of fire\\n\\nSeven people were killed in the blaze, and fifteen thousand were made homeless, including 14% of the population of Ottawa and 42% of Hull's population.[5] Property losses amounted to $6,200,000 in Ottawa and $3,300,000 in Hull, with insurance covering 50% of the damage in Ottawa but only 23% of the damage in Hull.[5] More were killed by disease in the densely packed tent cities where the people were forced to live afterwards. Worldwide response to the disaster generated $957,000 in aid, including $4.86 from distant Chile.[6]\\n\\nLegacy [ edit ]\\n\\nA Souvenir photo views of the big fire, Ottawa & Hull, April 26, 1900, was produced.[7] A postcard was produced showing the aftereffects of the Ottawa Hull Fire of April 26, 1900, with a view of The Hotel Cecil on the south side of Wellington Street in Ottawa.[8]\\n\\nThe Hull-Ottawa fire\\n\\nSee also [ edit ]\\n\\nReferences [ edit ]\\n\\nCoordinates:\",\n",
       " 'Just two years after it was treading water as a fading startup called dotCloud, open-source darling Docker is soaring. The company announced Tues. it had raised a $95 million Series D funding that should value the company at about $1 billion, making it the latest in a wave of private tech companies to join the billion-dollar ranks.\\n\\nThe funding comes just half a year after Docker had raised its last funding and was led by a previously minor investor in the startup, Insight Venture Partners, alongside new investors Coatue, Goldman Sachs and Northern Trust . A who\\'s-who of venture firms already backing Docker re-upped in the round: Benchmark, Greylock Partners, Sequoia Capital, Trinity Ventures and Jerry Yang\\'s AME Cloud Ventures. While Docker didn\\'t disclose its valuation from the round, sources with knowledge peg the company\\'s pre-money valuation at just under $1 billion. PitchBook pegs the post-money valuation at $1.07 billion.\\n\\nJust 22 people in Jan. 2014, Docker now has more than 120, scrambling to meet the demand of the developer community for its flagship containers, virtual wrappers that package an application\\'s code and make it easy to break up an app into pieces that can be quickly upgraded, approved and swapped out. The open-source version of the Docker product has been downloaded more than 300 million times, representing more than 1,000% growth; more than 33,000 GitHub projects have Docker in the title alone.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve seen unprecedented growth and momentum in all aspects of our business,\" says CEO Ben Golub . \"We want to have all the resources we need to take advantage of it, especially with all the mainstream enterprises jumping into Docker.\"\\n\\nDespite its short lifespan, Docker does have powerful friends in the enterprise. The company has made high profile partnerships with the big players like Amazon Web Services, IBM , Microsoft and VMware. The company has the highest buying intention score of any enterprise company or open-source project in six years of tracking by research firm Enterprise Technology Research. And existing customers include Gilt, Goldman Sachs, Spotify and Yelp.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs and Northern Trust, two of the investors joining this funding round, are actually users of Docker containers whose interest started in their IT departments, Golub says. By having Insight lead the round and Coatue join in, Docker\\'s also signalling it\\'s moving into the growth stage of companies typically much older than two years.\\n\\nThe reason for the quick successive funding is that while Docker sees massive opportunity ahead of it, the company\\'s in a critical phase of adolescence. It\\'s only been offering a hosted site for work organizations to share projects, Docker Hub, since last June, and it announced the beta of its big-company paid offering, Docker Hub Enterprise, in Dec., with 15 large companies testing so far.\\n\\nThe vast majority of Docker users don\\'t, and won\\'t pay for their usage. They fall under the purview of founder and former CEO Solomon Hykes, who as CTO oversees the open-source, free Docker Project. So when it comes to making real money from big customers, Docker\\'s still new to the game. That means investors are offering money as fast as the company will take it to build out a sales team and keep its product on schedule. The company raised its Series C before it had spent the money from its Series A, and is only halfway through the money from its Series B while it raised the current round.\\n\\n\"People are racing to get behind the opportunity here because they see a wide open market that\\'s rethinking the entire data center,\" says investor Jerry Chen of Greylock. \"This will be a multi-billion dollar company and they need this money to reach their full potential. Investors are saying, \\'Hey there\\'s a huge opportunity in front of you, don\\'t be afraid to be aggressive.\\'\"\\n\\nDocker\\'s in a race with a whole wave of sometime-partner startups in the cloud space, many of them also open-sourced. Golub says the company\\'s committed to supporting and building that ecosystem out, with apps helping people work \"into the thousands.\"\\n\\n\"Right now the watchword is to give flexibility,\" Golub says. But Docker still aspires to be the biggest of the bunch. Vmware, the virtual machine company, trades at a market cap north of $35 billion today. \"We have the potential to build one of the most significant companies of the decade,\" Golub adds. \"But we have a lot of hard work to do to get there, for a two-year-old company with 120 people and a pet turtle.\"',\n",
       " 'The Defense Department estimates it will save an average of $44,000 a year for every contractor it replaces with full-time federal personnel to perform critical defense jobs, according to the House-Senate conference report on the fiscal 2010 defense appropriation bill.\\n\\nThe measure, which passed Congress on Saturday, contains $5 billion to hire replacements for contractors currently performing what have been termed \"inherently government functions\" both at home and abroad. Those functions include a wide range of activities, from supervising other contractors who provide guard services at forward operating bases, to providing oversight of aid projects overseas.\\n\\nThe Bush administration widely expanded the use of contractors following the invasion of Iraq. At the time, officials argued that the Pentagon and other agencies had to staff up quickly; the war was seen as a limited operation that would end quickly, without the need to either increase the size of the military or the ranks of civilian employees.\\n\\nThe aim was also to save money, but last year Congress reported that contract employees were each costing the government an average of $250,000 annually, an amount far in excess of what federal employees or military personnel were paid.\\n\\nA recent Congressional Research Service study acknowledged that contractors played an important role in Iraq, but also indicated that they make up more than half of the Pentagon\\'s personnel in Afghanistan. With the number of U.S. troops expected to increase by 30,000 in Afghanistan in the coming months, CRS estimated that the number of contractors there will also increase -- by up to 56,000.\\n\\nAlthough the fiscal 2010 defense appropriation bill provides $5 billion to allow defense personnel, rather than contractors, to perform critical department functions, there was no estimate available Wednesday on how many new defense employees will be hired with that money.\\n\\nThe bill includes a number of other important provisions:\\n\\nIt provides $288 million for the Pentagon\\'s inspector general to hire additional investigators for oversight of acquisition and contracting. Congress added about $16 million to the administration request to enable the hiring of additional investigators.\\n\\nIt also reduces contracted advisory and assistance services by $51 million, and includes general provisions to stop further conversions by the Department of Defense from government functions to contractors.',\n",
       " 'We owe Ralph Nader and Cynthia McKinney an apology. They were right about Barack Obama. They were right about the corporate state. They had the courage of their convictions and they stood fast despite wholesale defections and ridicule by liberals and progressives.\\n\\nObama lies as cravenly, if not as crudely, as George W. Bush. He promised us that the transfer of $12.8 trillion in taxpayer money to Wall Street would open up credit and lending to the average consumer. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), however, admitted last week that banks have reduced lending at the sharpest pace since 1942. As a senator, Obama promised he would filibuster amendments to the FISA Reform Act that retroactively made legal the wiretapping and monitoring of millions of American citizens without warrant; instead he supported passage of the loathsome legislation. He told us he would withdraw American troops from Iraq, close the detention facility at Guantánamo, end torture, restore civil liberties such as habeas corpus and create new jobs. None of this has happened.\\n\\nHe is shoving a health care bill down our throats that would give hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to the private health insurance industry in the form of subsidies, and force millions of uninsured Americans to buy insurers’ defective products. These policies would come with ever-rising co-pays, deductibles and premiums and see most of the seriously ill left bankrupt and unable to afford medical care. Obama did nothing to halt the collapse of the Copenhagen climate conference, after promising meaningful environmental reform, and has left us at the mercy of corporations such as ExxonMobil. He empowers Israel’s brutal apartheid state. He has expanded the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where hundreds of civilians, including entire families, have been slaughtered by sophisticated weapons systems such as the Hellfire missile, which sucks the air out of victims’ lungs. And he is delivering war and death to Yemen, Somalia and perhaps Iran.\\n\\nThe illegal wars and occupations, the largest transference of wealth upward in American history and the egregious assault on civil liberties, all begun under George W. Bush, raise only a flicker of tepid protest from liberals when propagated by the Democrats. Liberals, unlike the right wing, are emotionally disabled. They appear not to feel. The tea-party protesters, the myopic supporters of Sarah Palin, the veterans signing up for Oath Keepers and the myriad of armed patriot groups have swept into their ranks legions of disenfranchised workers, angry libertarians, John Birchers and many who, until now, were never politically active. They articulate a legitimate rage. Yet liberals continue to speak in the bloodless language of issues and policies, and leave emotion and anger to the protofascists. Take a look at the 3,000-word suicide note left by Joe Stack, who flew his Piper Cherokee last month into an IRS office in Austin, Texas, murdering an IRS worker and injuring dozens. He was not alone in his rage.\\n\\n“Why is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities (and in the case of the GM executives, for scores of years) and when it’s time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity, the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours?” Stack wrote. “Yet at the same time, the joke we call the American medical system, including the drug and insurance companies, are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple, and this country’s leaders don’t see this as important as bailing out a few of their vile, rich cronies. Yet, the political ‘representatives’ (thieves, liars, and self-serving scumbags is far more accurate) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the ‘terrible health care problem’. It’s clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people don’t get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in.”\\n\\nThe timidity of the left exposes its cowardice, lack of a moral compass and mounting political impotence. The left stands for nothing. The damage Obama and the Democrats have done is immense. But the damage liberals do the longer they beg Obama and the Democrats for a few scraps is worse. It is time to walk out on the Democrats. It is time to back alternative third-party candidates and grass-roots movements, no matter how marginal such support may be. If we do not take a stand soon we must prepare for the rise of a frightening protofascist movement, one that is already gaining huge ground among the permanently unemployed, a frightened middle class and frustrated low-wage workers. We are, even more than Glenn Beck or tea-party protesters, responsible for the gusts fanning the flames of right-wing revolt because we have failed to articulate a credible alternative.A shift to the Green Party, McKinney and Nader, along with genuine grass-roots movements, will not be a quick fix. It will require years in the wilderness. We will again be told by the Democrats that the least-worse candidate they select for office is better than the Republican troll trotted out as an alternative. We will be bombarded with slick commercials about hope and change and spoken to in a cloying feel-your-pain language. We will be made afraid. But if we again acquiesce we will be reduced to sad and pathetic footnotes in our accelerating transformation from a democracy to a totalitarian corporate state. Isolation and ridicule — ask Nader or McKinney — is the cost of defying power, speaking truth and building movements. Anger at injustice, as Martin Luther King wrote, is the political expression of love. And it is vital that this anger become our own. We have historical precedents to fall back upon.\\n\\n“Here in the United States, at the beginning of the twentieth century, before there was a Soviet Union to spoil it, you see, socialism had a good name,” the late historian and activist Howard Zinn said in a lecture a year ago at Binghamton University. “Millions of people in the United States read socialist newspapers. They elected socialist members of Congress and socialist members of state legislatures. You know, there were like fourteen socialist chapters in Oklahoma. Really. I mean, you know, socialism—who stood for socialism? Eugene Debs, Helen Keller, Emma Goldman, Clarence Darrow, Jack London, Upton Sinclair. Yeah, socialism had a good name. It needs to be restored.”\\n\\nSocial change does not come through voting. It is delivered through activism, organizing and mobilization that empower groups to confront the hegemony of the corporate state and the power elite. The longer socialism is identified with the corporatist policies of the Democratic Party, the longer we allow the right wing to tag Obama as a socialist, the more absurd and ineffectual we become. The right-wing mantra of “Obama the socialist,” repeated a few days ago to a room full of Georgia Republicans, by Newt Gingrich, the former U.S. speaker of the House, is discrediting socialism itself. Gingrich, who looks set to run for president, called Obama the “most radical president” the country had seen in decades. “By any standard of government control of the economy, he is a socialist,” Gingrich said. If only the critique were true.\\n\\nThe hypocrisy and ineptitude of the Democrats become, in the eyes of the wider public, the hypocrisy and ineptitude of the liberal class. We can continue to tie our own hands and bind our own feet or we can break free, endure the inevitable opprobrium, and fight back. This means refusing to support the Democrats. It means undertaking the laborious work of building a viable socialist movement. It is the only alternative left to save our embattled open society. We can begin by sending a message to the Green Party, McKinney and Nader. Let them know they are no longer alone.',\n",
       " 'The Islamic State appears to have manufactured rudimentary chemical warfare shells and attacked Kurdish positions in Iraq and Syria with them as many as three times in recent weeks, according to field investigators, Kurdish officials and a Western ordnance disposal technician who examined the incidents and recovered one of the shells.\\n\\nThe development, which the investigators said involved toxic industrial or agricultural chemicals repurposed as weapons, signaled a potential escalation of the group’s capabilities, though it was not entirely without precedent.\\n\\nBeginning more than a decade ago, Sunni militants in Iraq have occasionally used chlorine or old chemical warfare shells in makeshift bombs against American and Iraqi government forces. And Kurdish forces have claimed that militants affiliated with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, used a chlorine-based chemical in at least one suicide truck bomb in Iraq this year.\\n\\nFiring chemical mortar shells across distances, however, as opposed to dispersing toxic chemicals via truck bombs or stationary devices, would be a new tactic for the group, and would require its munitions makers to overcome a significantly more difficult technical challenge.',\n",

I have one daughter and I have five granddaughters,” Moore said to the crowd of about 100 attendees.\\n\\nThe report, published last week, said that Moore asked multiple teenage women out on dates while he was in his 30s and gave some of them alcohol. One woman said he took her home and undressed her when she was 14. Moore denied those charges.\\n\\n“I have the highest regard for the protection of young children,” Moore said, adding that “to be attacked for allegations of sexual misconduct contradicts my entire career of the law. I want to make it clear to the media present and the people present I have not provided alcoholic beverages — beer or anything else to minors. I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone. These allegations came four and a half weeks before the general election on Dec. 12. Why now?

That these grown women would wait 40 years to come forward right before an election to bring charges is absolutely unbelievable.”\\n\\nThe crowd then broke in brief applause.\\n\\n“The Democrats and Republican establishment know the importance of this election. In fact most people in America know the importance of this election,” Moore said. “It may well determine the future of our country.”\\n\\nThe report was meant to divert attention away from other issues, Moore continued, and help former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate.\\n\\n“This article is a prime example of fake news, intended to divert attention from the true issues that affect our country, like healthcare, military readiness, tax reform, immigration, and the national debt. We do not intend to let the Democrats or establishment Republicans or anybody else behind this story to stop this campaign,” Moore said.\\n\\nMoore said new information would come forward in the next few days about the Post article. He didn’t elaborate on what that information would be.\\n\\n“There are investigations that are going on. In the next few days there will be revelations about the motivation and the content of this article,” Moore said. “I do not expect the Washington Post to stop, I think they have a political agenda, and I think they’re running that agenda and everybody in this room, everybody watching on these cameras, should ask themselves it’s strange that after 40 years of constant investigations people have waited from four weeks prior to the election to bring their complaints.”\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Economic policies around the world are undergoing a change and it’s not just about the Millionaire Blueprint. A feeling of ultra nationalism is sweeping the world and protectionist tendencies are on the rise. From the crisis in Greece to Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump in the US, the world is increasingly seeing a subtle but sure shift towards nationalist feelings impacting immigration, but more importantly trade.\\n\\nRestrictive trade practices which were frowned upon not too far back are slowly getting accepted. Companies and businesses are showing a reluctant tendency to accept the same. But is this trend, which was not seen much after the Second World War, the way forward? Ron Paul differs.\\n\\nWho is Ron Paul?\\n\\nRon Paul is a prominent voice in the US political-economic circles who is known for his views on low taxes, free markets and constitutional government. He is a former member of the House of Representatives and has been a presidential candidate thrice. Ron has always spoken out for prosperity, liberty and peace. He advocates a drastic reduction in the size of the federal government accompanied by a return to basic constitutional principles.\\n\\n‘Protectionists’ vs. Ron Paul\\n\\nMonopolies and Restrictive trade practices are a big hindrance to the free market economy. There was a time when the developing and third world countries were not part of the WTO and had narrow and un-coordinated trade policies which were tailor made to protect their own markets and jobs. The developed world was looking for markets to off load their finished products. The cost of finished product increased beyond profitable levels and the availability of cheaper workforce pushed manufacturing to the developing world.\\n\\nThe champions of free market economy were suddenly not so sure and electorates reposed their faith in right wing politicians who advocated protectionist trade policies. Ron Paul is not amongst them.\\n\\nRon Paul’s Outlook\\n\\nRon has always advocated return to sound monetary policies. He has always opposed anything that goes against the basic grain of freedom of citizens, be it economic, political or social. He has always voted against any move to raise taxes, unbalanced budget, raising congressional pay, regulating the Internet and government-paid junket. He was also against the Iraq war, against the Patriot Act and the proposal to increase the power of the executive branch.\\n\\nThe Way Forward\\n\\nRon in his New Year message to the incoming Donald Trump administration had outlined his four key proposals as the way forward. He continued with his known position of closing down the US Federal Reserve after an audit. He also champions a cut in both taxes and spending including on health and military spending. Getting the US troops deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq finds a place in his list. His commitment to free market policies makes him advocate the scrapping of Obamacare and have a true free-market healthcare system.\\n\\nA true patriot and believer of the American Culture, Ron Paul at the age of 81 still stands firm for free equal and just policies.\\n\\nThe future of the media is in our hands!

       " '(Newser) – \"Mix-up\" is a word best left out of sentences involving another word: pregnancy. But the two are making headlines together following yesterday\\'s report that a woman in Rome became pregnant with twins after undergoing fertility treatment—except the embryos she was implanted with weren\\'t those of her and her partner. The woman wasn\\'t alerted to the issue until she was three months along. The AFP reports the switch somehow happened on Dec. 4 at the Sandro Pertini Hospital in Rome. Four couples received treatment that day, and it\\'s unclear whether any other improper pregnancies resulted.\\n\\nThere\\'s also no word on how the mix-up came to light, though Rome\\'s health authority said it learned there was \"genetic incompatibility\" between the parents and embryos on March 27. The country\\'s health ministry is now investigating, and no further implantations are being done at the clinic. It\\'s far from the first time this has happened: In 2009 an Ohio woman implanted with the wrong embryos gave birth to a baby boy then handed him over to his biological parents; a 2000 in-vitro mix-up saw a San Francisco woman implanted with another couple\\'s embryos as well. The Chronicle reports that the doctor immediately realized his mistake but didn\\'t reveal it; Susan Buchweitz learned of this mistake 10 months after birth after a whistleblower tipped off the Medical Board of California. The biological father of her son sued for custody, and was granted shared custody in 2005. (It\\'s not the only alarming pregnancy story in the news this week.)\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'When Canadian government officials visited St. Petersburg last year for the G20, they swapped their email addresses with temporary ones and left their Canadian cellphones behind.\\n\\nThe U.S. State Department\\'s bureau of diplomatic security, meanwhile, recently warned that visitors to Russia should have \"no expectation of privacy,\" that all means of communication should be \"assumed to be monitored.\"\\n\\nSince the Cold War, Russia\\'s reputation as an intrusive state has been well established. But as the Sochi Olympic Games approach, the host country appears to be aiming for surveillance gold.\\n\\nIn fact, security experts are warning athletes, journalists, spectators and government officials that the coming Olympics will see the most invasive security measures the Games have ever seen.\\n\\nThe warnings are based partly on the work of two Russian investigative journalists who uncovered the plan to significantly soup up existing surveillance technology in Sochi in time for the arrival of thousands of foreigners.\\n\\nWith the support of the University of Toronto\\'s Citizen Lab at the Munk school of global affairs, an academic group that looks at technology, human rights and security, Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan made their discovery using open source documents relating to preparations for the Games.\\n\\nThey found, for example, that a Russian company promising ultra-fast, free WiFi in Sochi is also installing DPI or Deep Packet Inspection technology.\\n\\nDPI has legitimate uses, but in this case it is apparently aimed at allowing authorities to filter email for key words and track who\\'s talking to whom, as well as what they\\'re saying.\\n\\nJournalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan: Unprecedented surveillance for an Olympic Games? (Nahlah Ayed / CBC)\\n\\nIn short, Soldatov explained to CBC News, every phone call, every email, every social media message in Sochi will be accessible, traceable by Russia\\'s Federal Security Service — the FSB — the organization in charge of securing the Olympics.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s very intrusive,\" Soldatov said in an interview in Moscow. \"Everyone should expect that all their communications, all the technical devices like smart phones, laptops, will be completely transparent.\"\\n\\nForce of habit\\n\\nCritics say the FSB is emboldened to take such extraordinary measures by the first Russian president ever to have once been an active agent of the KGB (the FSB\\'s precursor) — and for whom the Sochi Games is a deeply personal project.\\n\\nVladimir Putin \"just decided that his favourite security service, the FSB, should be given all powers it needs to secure the Olympics, and to make it perfect,\" Soldatov says.\\n\\nA public decree last month also allows for all data collected in Sochi to be stored for three years.\\n\\n\"It\\'s actually an excellent opportunity for counter-intelligence because you might gather … personal data of so many important people,\" Soldatov suggests.\\n\\nThe FSB, an impenetrable organization with little oversight, is run out of Lubyanka, the old KGB headquarters, an imposing building in the heart of Moscow that is currently under construction and shrouded in scaffolding.\\n\\nFSB officials believe the elevated threat of terrorism warrants tough measures, but at their only news conference on the subject so far, in October, they promised those measures would be \"invisible.\"\\n\\nThese security measures range from the deployment of a whole brigade of elite special forces to the unprecedented requirement of background checks for spectators.\\n\\nBut it\\'s the extent of all the surveillance the FSB is planning that has deepened much of the disquiet, at home and abroad, over the coming games.\\n\\nA Russian soldier patrols the air defence missile military base stationed near the Olympic park at the Black Sea resort city of Sochi in November. (Yuri Kadobnov / AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\nFor Russia, surveillance measures may be something of a force of habit. Not only was surveillance a key pillar of the Communist regime in the old Soviet Union, but it is also apparently still seen in some Russian circles as having been the key to a \"perfect\" 1980 Moscow Olympics.\\n\\nThere appears to be the temptation, says Soldatov, to try to replicate the 1980 experience for Sochi 2014.\\n\\nIn 1980, \"it was mostly about how to deal with hostile foreign forces,\" he says. \"And I think this kind of mentality is still alive.\"\\n\\nThe obvious difference today, of course, is the technology now at their disposal.\\n\\nIn years past, the KGB would have needed teams of people to follow an individual, now a smartphone is all they need.\\n\\nDrones overhead\\n\\nThere is much more to Sochi\\'s ultra-modern security plan — one that some security analysts believe could set a new standard in invasive surveillance and large-event security for years to come.\\n\\nAt Sochi\\'s central command centre, officials monitor a wall of smart cameras on the streets — thousands installed especially for the Olympics.\\n\\n\"This whole territory is being controlled,\" says Eduard Lutovinov, deputy director of the Sochi command centre. \"We think we are very prepared security-wise. The threat is no bigger now than in any other city that ever hosted the Olympics.\"\\n\\nRecent events, of course, suggest otherwise. A series of suicide bombings in Volgograd have rattled Russians, and follow a vow by Chechen Islamist militant Doku Umarov to disrupt what he calls the \"Satanic games.\"\\n\\nA Russian police officer stands on a street in Sochi in December. Security was stepped up in the wake of two recent terror incidents. (Reuters)\\n\\nSochi is adjacent to the often-restive North Caucasus, roiled by repression and a constant insurgency.\\n\\nSo Sochi is sealed tight, its streets a gauntlet of checkpoints under the vigilant watch of at least 70,000 police and soldiers. As well, an entire brigade of elite special forces are deployed in the mountains nearby.\\n\\nOn top of that, Russia\\'s Olympic arsenal will include anti-ballistic missiles, an underwater sonar system, even underwater machine guns.\\n\\nAnother part of the arsenal are drones that will be, for the first time, monitoring the Games from above, as well as robotic bomb detectors that will prowl the Olympic grounds below.\\n\\nBut if fighting terrorism was the chief motivation, then the approach is suspect, argues Soldatov. Some of the planned measures are \"completely useless to prevent terrorist attacks,\" he says.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t use drones to prevent suicide bombers … But they\\'re very good things to prevent [protests] because it might spot people trying to gather.\"\\n\\nRussia recently agreed to allow an official protest zone at Sochi. But the overall aim, Soldatov suggests, is to stop any criticism or protest that may embarrass Putin or his pet project as the world watches.\\n\\nSochi activists have already reported being harassed by authorities as a result of their activism, and what appears to be surveillance of their communications.\\n\\nSochi activist Vladimir Kimaev: \\'You can hear they are listening in.\\' (Corinne Seminoff/CBC)\\n\\nSochi activist Vladimir Kimaev, who has been writing about the environmental impact of the coming Games, says his house has been raided twice, and that officials somehow always know local plans for any protest.\\n\\n\"For example, here\\'s my phone and you can hear they\\'re listening in, there\\'s an echo,\" he says. \"I can hear when they start recording, they are absolutely eavesdropping on me.\"\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch says it has documented similar cases since 2008.\\n\\nThe FSB declined repeated requests for an interview.

       " '\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\\n\\nRepublicans in the Senate voted Wednesday night on a bill that would significantly accelerate the repeal of key elements of the Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare) through reconciliation. As Republican Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) has acknowledged, this will almost certainly mean that Republicans will effectively get rid of the health-care law before coming up with a replacement. On the face of it, this seems like terrible politics. If Obamacare looks like it is unraveling, insurance companies are likely to pull out quickly, potentially leaving millions of people without health insurance and leaving Republicans with the blame. It’s a very risky gamble, but one that may have a strategic logic behind it.\\n\\nThe Republicans are burning their bridges\\n\\nGOP Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) has defended the Republican strategy as an exercise in bridge building. He told the New York Times: “The Obamacare bridge is collapsing, and we’re sending in a rescue team. . . . Then we’ll build new bridges to better health care, and finally, when these new bridges are finished, we’ll close the old bridge.” Actually, they’re burning the bridges behind them so that they have no choice but to fight. The recently deceased game theorist Thomas Schelling describes the strategy of bridge burning as follows, in his classic book “Arms and Influence”:\\n\\nOften, we must maneuver into a position where we no longer have much choice left. This is the old business of burning bridges. If you are faced with an enemy who thinks you would turn and run if he kept advancing, and if the bridge is there to run across, he may keep advancing. . . . But if you burn the bridge so that you cannot retreat, and in sheer desperation there is nothing you can do but defend yourself, he has a new calculation to make.\\n\\nAvinash Dixit and Barry Nalebuff expand on this basic idea to note that bridge-burning may have two benefits. First, it unites your own forces. They have to fight because they know that there is no alternative — desertion or retreat is no longer a possibility. Second, it may cause the enemy to retreat, because they know that they face a truly determined opponent, who has no choice but to fight.\\n\\nAfter nearly seven hours of voting and over the vocal objections of many Democrats, the Senate voted 51 to 48 to pass a budget resolution to begin work on legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\\n\\nRepublican leaders are deliberately backing their party into a corner\\n\\nThis plausibly explains why key Republicans want to repeal Obamacare before replacing it. They are burning the bridges behind themselves. Republicans don’t have any agreed plan to replace Obamacare (Paul Krugman has argued that this is no accident, because any possible replacement would be horribly unpopular). Thus, they face the risk of their anti-Obamacare coalition falling apart, as Republicans start to fight among themselves, and Democrats pick off the weaker members of the pack.\\n\\nRepealing before replacing might possibly forestall the rout. First, it might stiffen Republicans’ backs. If they cannot retreat to a tacit acceptance of Obamacare — since Obamacare is gone, they may be more likely to stick together and agree on a replacement. Even if that replacement is going to be very unpopular, it probably would be less unpopular than getting rid of Obamacare and replacing it with nothing.\\n\\nSecond, it might help peel off Democrats. The Democrats’ leader in the Senate, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), has sworn that Democrats will not compromise with Republicans on any Obamacare replacement. Republican leaders are probably thinking that the Democrats’ calculus will change if they are faced with a choice between a feeble replacement and no replacement.\\n\\nThis is incredibly risky\\n\\nAs Schelling, Dixit and Nalebuff suggest, burning bridges might help the Republicans get out of the trap that they have created themselves. It may both stiffen Republicans’ resolve and make their adversaries more likely to retreat.\\n\\nYet as these scholars probably would point out, this is still an extremely risky strategy. Burning your bridges so that you have no hope of retreat means that you risk losing all your forces if you are defeated. It also may be highly unpopular with the troops. Republicans in the House seem to be very nervous about the idea of repealing without replacing. Senate Republicans like Collins also look to be unhappy. Finally, President-elect Donald Trump has promised that his administration will somehow come up with an Obamacare replacement in short order — although it is unclear what that may be.',\n",

       " 'The first colony of wild beavers to inhabit an English river for around 400 years has expanded.\\n\\nOne of the female beavers on the River Otter in Devon has given birth to at least two – and possibly as many as four – kits.\\n\\nRetired environmental scientist and keen beaver watcher Tom Buckley captured the vivid footage of two kits possibly taking their first swim. In one clip the mother beaver appears to be giving the kit a tour of the river, holding the young animal carefully in her jaws. In a second, a young beaver appears not to be too keen on swimming and heads speedily back to the bank.\\n\\nWild beavers seen in England for first time in centuries Read more\\n\\nBuckley said: “When I saw these new born baby beavers I was totally overwhelmed and thought it must be a miracle. My first sighting of this year’s new born kits was when I saw their mother swimming with one of them in her mouth to an area nearby where their father was waiting to greet them.\\n\\n“One of the kits, however, seemed extremely unhappy to be out in the big wide world and as soon as its mother let it go it rushed back to its burrow. Not surprising really – the world can be a very scary place. This was possibly their first experience of what lies outside of their burrow.”\\n\\nA population of beavers was first confirmed on the River Otter in February 2014. This was the first time that breeding beavers were known to be living in the English countryside in as much as 400 years.\\n\\nIn summer 2014 the department for environment, food and rural affairs expressed its intention to remove the animals, citing fears that they might be carrying a disease.\\n\\nDevon Wildlife Trust built a partnership of supportive local landowners, academic institutions and beaver veterinary and management experts to suggest creating a wild beaver monitoring project.\\n\\nIt captured the beavers to check if they were healthy and re-released them into the wild. The trust now believes there are at least 11 beavers in the river – including the two babies – but believes there could be as many as 15.\\n\\nDevon Wildlife Trust’s Mark Elliott said: “We are thrilled that the beavers have bred. The baby kits appear fit and healthy and the adults seem as if they are taking their parenting responsibilities very seriously. It tells us that the beavers are very much at home in this corner of Devon.\\n\\n“The slowly expanding population of these wild animals will help us to gain valuable insights into beavers and their environment – both in terms of animal behaviour and any benefits and effects on the surrounding river system.”\\n\\nRewilding Britain: bringing wolves, bears and beavers back to the land Read more\\n\\nElliott also asked people not to disturb the beavers. “The beavers have proved enormously popular with local people and we understand that many will now want to see the kits for themselves. But like all new parents, the beavers will need a bit of space and peace at this time. So we ask that visitors take care not to disturb them. This means remaining on public footpaths, keeping a respectful distance from them, and keeping dogs under close control, especially when near the river.”\\n\\nHe said that beavers give birth to an average of three kits and not all kits would make it to adulthood, so an expansion of the River Otter beaver population would be steady rather than rapid.',\n",

It’ll display emotions through these animations, Warren reports, with bounces for happiness and frowning for displeasure depending on what it’s doing. Bing, Foursquare and other data sources will provide Cortana with its digital intelligence, according to the report, and make it so that it can offer some of the contextual smarts of Google Now, the Android-based anticipatory helper.\\n\\nThe most interesting feature of Cortana might be its transparency in terms of what data it does and doesn’t use – Warren says it’ll offer a “Notebook” feature that lists exactly what kind of information a user is granting Cortana access to, including stuff like location information, biographical points, reminders and contact info. Cortana is designed to learn more about a user through use, but that information won’t necessarily be stored in the Notebook without a user’s okay to do so.

But it should be written down. They have to issue that document because that statement could be taken back anytime,” Kadamay chair Gloria Arellano said.\\n\\n“We will not celebrate yet. We will not yet offer our gratitude [until we are given the rights to the houses],” she said.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nArellano said Mr. Duterte’s openness was a “big triumph” for the urban poor. But she also expressed hope that the President would look at the overall problem of homelessness in the country.\\n\\n“So many houses that are built by the government remain unoccupied,” she said. “We hope that they just distribute it to the homeless poor.”\\n\\nHuge housing backlog\\n\\nThe Kadamay occupation of the government housing project in Bulacan highlights the country’s severe housing backlog, estimated at 5.56 million.\\n\\nThe NHA is the sole government agency tasked with building shelters for 1.5 million homeless families, which grow at a rate of 3.4 percent annually.\\n\\nAddressing Kadamay members, Mr. Duterte said they should not trouble the police or soldiers who were already living in the government housing units.\\n\\n“Eventually, they will be removed and transferred to a new unit that is better than the one you took from them,” he added.\\n\\n‘Understand the poor’\\n\\nMr. Duterte sought understanding from the soldiers as he defended his decision to give the houses to Kadamay members.\\n\\n“Well, anyway, I said I’m asking you, if possible, do not be offended. Take it with an open mind, I myself, your President, am pleading with you: ‘Let us not wage a fight against our own people. Since they are poor, try to understand them,’” he said.\\n\\nMr. Duterte said he did not want to use force because it would just result in violence.\\n\\n“Do not pick a fight. It would be useless. And then the police have guns, and you know, something could go awfully wrong. Let us let it be,” he said.\\n\\nMr. Duterte said he had asked the NHA, which had the money to build the new houses, to look for a suitable land for these.\\n\\nHe said he could even give the houses furnished with a bed.\\n\\nLast week, the NHA lifted the eviction orders it issued against the families after Kadamay members agreed to submit to a validation as housing applicants.\\n\\nArellano hoped that the President’s pronouncement would cover other abandoned housing units that they occupied in Bulacan, not only those intended for policemen and military personnel.\\n\\n“The houses should be directly awarded to those who occupy them,” said Kadamay spokesperson Michael Beltran.\\n\\nBeltran said the question remained whether the urban poor beneficiaries would be made to pay for the houses, as with other relocation programs.\\n\\nMany of the occupied houses have no doors, windows and toilets.\\n\\nRead Next\\n\\nLATEST STORIES\\n\\nMOST READ',\n",
       " 'Before getting to the point — the possibility that liberal trolls pretending to be Men’s Rights Activists (MRAs) are creating fake “hate” against women — permit me to clarify something: I am both a journalist and a conservative and do not think those two things are contradictory in any way. I was a full-time newspaper reporter, editor and columnist for nearly a decade before I became a conservative in the mid-1990s, and so my perspective on politics and media bias is somewhat different than many other conservatives.\\n\\nAll that is preamble to explaining my attitudes vis-a-vis the whole MRA movement and the so-called online “Manosphere.” You go to war with the army you have, as they say, and the current situation regarding feminism — which has become the “Sex Trouble” project — clearly requires an institutional base outside the currently existing ideological/political system. It would be foolish to expect, inter alia, the Heritage Foundation or National Review to get down in the trenches of the War of the Sexes as it is currently being fought. There are a handful of conservative journalists (including Ashe Schow of the Washington Examiner and Cathy Young of the Daily Beast) who “get it” in terms of the mutant totalitarian strain of feminism that has erupted into public spasms of raging insanity the past couple of years. However, there is generally a shortage of attention being paid to this by conservative media, and so we must build something new and different.\\n\\nThere is an existing network of online popular opposition to feminism, but this presents its own problems. Whereas mainstream conservative organizations allied with the GOP tend to be wimpy and prone to run for the hills the first time someone calls them ugly names, the grassroots “Manosphere” is the exact opposite: A lot of pissed-off-and-fed-up people who feel like they’ve been fighting a guerrilla war against feminism for years and who have a predictable tendency to Say Things You Wouldn’t Want to See Quoted in the New York Times.\\n\\nNo big deal, really. Grassroots is grassroots, and you cannot expect “message discipline” from random people on the Internet. However, the Left (of which feminism is a subsidiary) loves to play the guilt-by-association game, so when the spotlight suddenly shines over there where you’ve been fighting your guerrilla war, you can predict that they will do their “links-and-ties” tactic to try to discredit you. Trust me, my friends, I’ve got the scars of old battles and many tales to tell you about how this game is played, but let’s get down to a practical example.\\n\\nAaron Clarey wrote an article at Return of Kings highly critical of the new movie Mad Max: Fury Road. Because I almost never go to movies, I don’t really care about this any more than I care about any other vile poison emerging from Hollywood. Was it scripted by Catharine MacKinnon based on a novel by Andrea Dworkin, directed by Sheila Jeffreys and produced by Anita Sarkeesian? I don’t know, but it’s apparently got the whole Tough Action-Hero Chick thing happening, which is very much a feminist-approved theme, and Return of Kings is not down with anything that feminists approve.\\n\\nHowever, it is not Aaron’s opinion of this movie, but rather a comment someone left on his article that caught my attention because it caught the attention of a left-wing “male feminist” Whose Name Shall Not Be Written Here. The comment by “TS77RP1” reads thus:\\n\\nThe only way back is to begin punishing ambition in our daughters and in all female children. They need to be physically and psychologically disciplined to be servile and deferential and they unfortunately need to have it beaten into them that they should NEVER trust their own judgement and always seek guidance and permission of their male headships.\\n\\nMy daughter would be turned out with nothing but a shirt on her back if she so much as looked at a college website or played with her brother’s educational toys.\\n\\nShe would be belted to the point of being unable to sit if she exhibited confidence in decision making.\\n\\nI don’t want my wife to step foot out of the house unless her every dime and minute spent can be accounted for and executed in conjuncture with my approval. My daughter will exude obedience and timidity for whoever her future husband is and it’s imperative that all Christian Men demand nothing less within their own homes. Playtime for feminazis and the left is over. This is our world and our heritage to protect. Let the cultural war begin!\\n\\nWell, this is a horrifying thing to read, but is it authentic? I did a search for “TS77RP1” and this comment has apparently been deleted from Return of Kings and, furthermore, the only places on the Internet where that handle can be found are all quoting the left-wing “male feminist” Whose Name Shall Not Be Written Here.\\n\\nIf it walks like a moby and talks like a moby, it’s probably a moby, and if you don’t know what a moby is, you should learn.\\n\\nmoby\\n\\nAn insidious and specialized type of left-wing troll who visits blogs and impersonates a conservative for the purpose of either spreading false rumors intended to sow dissension among conservative voters, or who purposely posts inflammatory and offensive comments for the purpose of discrediting the blog in question.\\n\\nThe term is derived from the name of the liberal musician Moby, who famously suggested in February of 2004 that left-wing activists engage in this type of subterfuge: “For example, you can go on all the pro-life chat rooms and say you’re an outraged right-wing voter and that you know that George Bush drove an ex-girlfriend to an abortion clinic and paid for her to get an abortion. Then you go to an anti-immigration Web site chat room and ask, ‘What’s all this about George Bush proposing amnesty for illegal aliens?’”\\n\\nWas the commenter “TS77RP1” such a troll? I strongly suspect it. Having seen firsthand the insidious deceptions that the online Left is willing to employ, this would be par for the course. This doesn’t rule out the possibility Dictator Dad is real, but I’m extremely skeptical.\\n\\nAnyway, let this be a warning to the grassroots opposition to feminism: Keep your eyes open for similar dirty tricks.\\n\\nTeam Clinton is playing for keeps, you know.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare this: Share\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\n\\nReddit\\n\\n\\n\\nComments',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Telecommunications giant AT&T struck back on Wednesday at Sen. Herb Kohl, chair of a congressional antitrust panel, saying the lawmaker’s concerns about a lack of competition in the wireless industry were unfounded.\\n\\nKohl wrote to the Justice Department’s top antitrust regulator Christine Varney and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski on Monday to reiterate concerns over texting prices, large carriers failing to cooperate with smaller carriers to resolve roaming disputes, disputes over spectrum and deals that give one or another carrier exclusive access to popular phones like the iPhone.\\n\\nAT&T argued that cell service had become progressively cheaper, with revenue per minute falling 89 percent since 1994.\\n\\n“U.S. wireless prices are much lower than in any other major industrialized country,” wrote James Cicconi, an AT&T senior executive vice president.\\n\\nCicconi argued that texting prices had fallen because of package deals, “dropping almost 70 percent since January 2007,” and asserted that the pay-per-use price cited by Kohl represented less than 1 percent of AT&T’s customers.\\n\\nCicconi also argued that exclusive handset arrangements allowed a carrier and a manufacturer to split the high cost of marketing “an inventive but unproven new device.” Kohl had called the deals “a serious barrier to competition.”\\n\\n“I think AT&T is right on the handset exclusivity,” said Orrick antitrust expert David Smutny, who argued that telecommunications firms were vying to help manufacturers to come up with the new cool phone — the iPhone killer — in order to compete with the AT&T/Apple alliance.\\n\\n“What AT&T cares about is getting people to sign up for its service and what Apple cares about is getting people to get its cool phone. That’s pretty pro-consumer,” he said.\\n\\nCicconi said that AT&T complied with FCC regulations, which required it to allow other companies’ customers to roam to get voice service but not data, which means that they may not get email or Internet service on their phones if they are out of their servers’ area.\\n\\nAT&T also defended early termination fees as a way for the company to recoup money spent discounting handsets.\\n\\nOverall, Orrick’s Smutny said he failed to see significant antitrust issues in the wireless industry.\\n\\n“Most people are served by at least three and sometimes five or six wireless carriers,” he said. “On the specific issues that Sen. Kohl raises, I think that AT&T has the better of the argument.”',\n",
       " 'Mets general manager Sandy Alderson met with the media in New York today to address a number of topics, including health updates on starters Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz, each of whom was reported to have a bone spur in his pitching elbow yesterday. Per Newsday’s Marc Carig (links to Twitter), Alderson said that club doctors aren’t worried about the spur in Syndergaard’s right elbow becoming worse, and the New York Post’s Mike Puma tweets that Syndergaard’s spur is much smaller than the spur in Matz’s elbow. Accordingly, the outlook on Matz was painted a bit more grimly, with Alderson somewhat stating, “He’ll either pitch and be able to tolerate the discomfort, or he won’t.” As Puma tweets, surgery to remove the spur would sideline Matz for three months, so he’ll look to continue pitching for the time being.\\n\\nMatz won’t need to be skipped on a regular basis, though, tweets ESPN New York’s Adam Rubin. However, the team might eventually move to a six-man rotation. Presumably, said mix would include right-hander Zack Wheeler, though Alderson said that while he’ll soon have a new projection for Wheeler’s return, he does not have a new one at this tme (via Carig). Logan Verrett is another option to get some starts, and he’ll take the hill Wednesday in place of Matz, as Matz will be bumped back to Thursday, per Rubin.\\n\\nThe rotation, of course, is far from the only area in which the Mets are dealing with injuries. First baseman Lucas Duda hasn’t suited up for a game since May 20 due to a stress fracture in his back, and he’s still at least two weeks away from even resuming baseball activities (Twitter link via MLB.com’s Anthony DiComo). As such, the earliest possible return date for Duda would seem to be August.\\n\\nLooking across the diamond, David Wright’s season could very well be over following neck surgery, and Alderson confirmed that the club worked out Cuban star Yulieski Gurriel, who could seemingly step in as an eventual alternative to the Mets’ longtime captain. Gurriel didn’t face live pitching in his workout, but he did run “fairly well,” per Alderson, and he also took batting practice and worked out in the field at both third base and second base (links to Carig on Twitter). They’re still weighing whether to make an offer, DiComo tweets, and it should be stressed that Gurriel is by no means an immediate replacement; it’s been months since Gurriel saw regular action in a game setting, and as such he’d need to spend a month ramping up in the minor leagues, in the Mets’ estimation.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the Mets have enlisted a different infield alternative by bringing Jose Reyes back to Queens on a minor league deal. He’s working exclusively at third base in the minors, according to Alderson, but upon his promotion to the big leagues he’ll begin working out in the outfield as well (via Rubin). The addition of Reyes doesn’t in any way preclude the team from signing Gurriel as well, Carig notes. Of course, the Mets will have to deal with a number of other clubs should they elect to make a serious run at Gurriel. He’s reportedly worked out for the heavy-spending Dodgers already, and he’s also been connected to the likes of the Astros, Giants and Yankees in recent weeks since being declared a free agent by MLB.',\n",

She is currently a sideline reporter for NBA games on TNT Sports and also works for NBA TV as a reporter and analyst, having worked previously as a sportscaster for ABC Sports, TBS Sports, and ESPN. She was also head coach and general manager of the WNBA\\'s Phoenix Mercury.\\n\\nIn 1995, Miller was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1999, she was inducted into the inaugural class of the Women\\'s Basketball Hall of Fame, located in Knoxville, Tennessee.[2] On August 20, 2010, Miller was also inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame for her success in international play.[3]\\n\\nShe is the sister of retired National Basketball Association (NBA) Hall of Famer Reggie Miller and former Major League Baseball catcher Darrell Miller.\\n\\nHigh school career [ edit ]\\n\\nMiller played at Riverside Polytechnic High School (1978–1982) where she was a four-year letter winner and led her team to a 132–4 record. She was awarded the Dial Award for the national high-school scholar-athlete of the year in 1981. She was the first player, male or female, to be named an All-American by Parade magazine four times.[4][5] Averaging 32.8 points and 15.0 rebounds a game, Miller was Street & Smith\\'s national High School Player of the Year in both 1981 and 1982. In her senior year she scored 105 points in a game against Norte Vista High School.[6] She set California state records for points scored in a single season (1156), and points scored in a high school career (3405).[4]\\n\\nUniversity of Southern California [ edit ]\\n\\nAt the University of Southern California (USC), the 6 ft. 2 in.

Her career rebounding mark of 1,534 ranks her third all-time in NCAA history. Miller was named Naismith College Player of the Year three times and earned the Wade Trophy (Player of the Year) once.[7] At USC, Miller led the Trojans to a 112–20 record and NCAA titles in 1983 and 1984 and was named NCAA Tournament MVP both years. Miller\\'s teammates included Cynthia Cooper, two-time WNBA MVP; Pamela McGee, 1984 Olympian and All-American, and Paula McGee, 1982 and 1983 All-American. Miller was coached by Linda K.

The team won six games, but lost two against the Soviet Union. In an opening round game, the USA team had a nine-point lead at halftime, but the Soviets came back to take the lead, and a final shot by the USA failed to drop, leaving the USSR team with a one-point victory 85–84, despite 23 points from Miller. The USA team won their next four games, setting up the gold medal game against USSR. This game was also close, and was tied at 82 points each with six seconds to go in the game. The Soviets Elena Chausova received the inbounds pass and hit the game winning shot in the final seconds, giving the USSR team the gold medal with a score of 84–82. The USA team earned the silver medal. Miller led the team in scoring, averaging 17.6 points per game, and tied for the lead in rebounding at 4.4 per game.[12]\\n\\nIn 1984, the USA sent its National team to the 1984 William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan, for pre-Olympic practice. The team easily beat each of the eight teams they played, winning by an average of just under 50 points per game. Miller led the team in scoring, averaging 15.1 points per game, led the team in rebounding with 4.4 per game and led the team in steals with 27.[13]\\n\\nMiller led the U.S. team to the gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and was also part of the gold medal team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela.\\n\\nMiller was selected to represent the USA at the inaugural Goodwill games, held in Moscow in July 1986. North Carolina State\\'s Kay Yow served as head coach. The team opened up with a 72–53 victory over Yugoslavia, led by 19 points from Miller, and followed that with a 21-point win over Brazil 91–70. The third game was against Czechoslovakia and would be much closer. Miller was the scoring leader in this game, scoring 26 points to help the USA to a 78–70 victory. The USA faced Bulgaria in the semi-final match up, and again won, this time 67–58. This set up the final against the Soviet Union, led by 7-foot-2 Ivilana Semenova, considered the most dominant player in the world. The Soviet team, had a 152–2 record in major international competition over the prior three decades, including an 84–82 win over the USA in the 1983 World Championships. The Soviets held the early edge, leading 21–19 at one time, before the USA went on a scoring run to take a large lead they would never relinquish. The final score was 83–60 in favor of the USA, earning the gold medal for the USA squad. For the entire event, Miller averaged 20.6 points to lead the team in scoring.[14]\\n\\nMiller continued to represent the USA with National team at the 1986 World Championships, held in Moscow, a month after the Goodwill games in Moscow. The USA team was even more dominant this time. The early games were won easily, and the semifinal against Canada, while the closest game for the USA so far, ended up an 82–59 victory. At the same time, the Soviet team was winning easily as well, and the final game pitted two teams each with 6–0 records. The Soviet team, having lost only once at home, wanted to show that the Goodwill games setback was a fluke. The USA team started by scoring the first eight points, and raced to a 45–23 lead, although the Soviets fought back and reduced the halftime margin to 13. The USA went on a 15–1 run in the second half to put the game away, and ended up winning the gold medal with a score of 108–88. Miller led all scorers in the game with 24 points.[15]\\n\\nAwards and honors [ edit ]\\n\\nPost-college career [ edit ]\\n\\nAfter graduating from USC in 1986, she was drafted by several professional basketball leagues, including the United States Basketball League, a men\\'s league.

We even have our Christmas tree up and I’m feeling quite festive with my “Indie Holidays” station blaring in the background as I work.\\n\\nOf course, a new space has required some reorganization as well as a few new purchases (for home, office and otherwise), and in the process we’ve managed to simplify and streamline a bit more (which we love).\\n\\nI’m planning to create a “Simple Kitchen” post soon to highlight everything we own in our “minimalist” kitchen to show you just how possible it is to do more with less stuff.\\n\\nUntil then, let’s eat pie, shall we?\\n\\nHave you guys tried our Vegan PB&J Pie yet? It’s one of my favorites.\\n\\nIn the process of making it I discovered the magic of date paste and coconut whipped cream mixed together to create a thick, custard-like mousse, perfect for pies and even no-churn ice cream! Since then I’ve been dying to try it in another variation.\\n\\nEnter: Chocolate Peanut Butter.\\n\\nThis magic starts with coconut whipped cream and date paste. Then a generous amount of melted dark chocolate and a giant heap of salted creamy peanut butter.\\n\\nHubba, hubba indeed.\\n\\nThe result is a rich, thick chocolate mousse infused with salty peanut butter piled into perfectly salty-sweet graham cracker crust – literally the pie of my dreams.\\n\\nThis pie is simple, requiring just 7 ingredients and easy-to-follow methods.\\n\\nIf you can master date paste (pitted dates whirled into a paste) and coconut whipped cream (chilled coconut cream whipped into an airy mousse), then you can totally make this pie. And, I highly recommend doing so because it’s bomb. Yes, I still say bomb (Rhonda). Deal with it.\\n\\nThis pie is my new favorite. It’s:\\n\\nCreamy\\n\\nThick\\n\\nRich\\n\\nChilled\\n\\nSuper chocolaty\\n\\nInfused with peanut butter\\n\\nPerfectly sweet\\n\\nNestled in a graham cracker crust\\n\\nDelectable\\n\\nSatisfying\\n\\n& Perfect for holiday gatherings and beyond\\n\\nOne bite into this bad boy and I was done for. I took two slices and shared the rest with a friend, who later reported she ate three slices in two days. That’s when you know it’s good – you can’t keep your hands off it.\\n\\nIf you make this pie, please let us know! Take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram, @minimalistbaker on Twitter, or leave a comment. We seriously love seeing what you guys cook up.\\n\\nHappy holiday baking season, friends! There’s much more sweet (and savory) goodness to come in the next few weeks. Cheers!',\n",

(Photo11: DC Comics) Story Highlights New movie, \\'Man of Steel, will open June 14\\n\\n\\'Superman Unchained\\' series begins on June 12\\n\\n\\'Batman/Superman\\' series will also begin in June\\n\\nSleepless nights crafting the adventures of Batman have been commonplace for writer Scott Snyder.\\n\\nHe can expect more insomnia penning that other favorite character of his: Superman.\\n\\nThis year, which marks the 75th anniversary of the Man of Steel, will celebrate the granddaddy of all superheroes in a number of ways. A new movie, Man of Steel, stars Henry Cavill as the cape-clad hero and arrives in theaters June 14. And DC Comics is putting some fresh eyes on the big, spit-curled guy standing for truth, justice and the American way.\\n\\nSnyder teams with artist (and DC co-publisher) Jim Lee for an all-new Superman Unchained series beginning June 12, and that same month sees the debut of Batman/Superman by writer Greg Pak and artist Jae Lee that will show the earliest meeting between the company\\'s two iconic heroes.\\n\\n\"We\\'re all fans and we\\'ve all known this character for a long time,\" Jim Lee says. \"You have to fight your natural tendency to do what you know or what you\\'ve always thought the character to be.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been pushing the creators to not be beholden to the past conceits and understandings\" of Superman, he adds. \"So we will speak to a new generation of readers.\"\\n\\nThe newbies will get their first glimpse at Unchained in a special Superman-centric offering on Free Comic Book Day, May 4, with an adrenaline-filled, epic sequence featuring Superman busting loose and saving the day.\\n\\nLee says they\\'ll pull back \"the camera\" sometimes, \"showing really how this small little figure, this human-shaped character, can literally move mountains,\" and Snyder aims to focus on this superhero who has the power to shape the world however he wants it yet looks at humanity to be inspired himself.\\n\\n\"If I think for a second, \\'I\\'m working on Superman,\\' you get chills and it becomes very, very intimidating when you think of all the amazing stories that have come before,\" says Snyder, who also is doing backup stories in Unchained with artist Dustin Nguyen.\\n\\n\"The way to approach a character as iconic as him is you just come at it from a standpoint of what you love the most about the character, and then write a story that explores that, tear it down and build it back up.\"\\n\\nLike Snyder has done with his popular Batman book, Unchained also will explore the Man of Steel\\'s supporting characters and how they occupy his thoughts as he goes about the business of being Superman.\\n\\n\"I know conceptually why he admires Lois Lane, but then when you\\'re writing them and you feel the chemistry between them and it comes to life on the page, it\\'s always these little bursts of surprises that have been a joy to discover with him,\" Snyder says.\\n\\n\"The energy we\\'re bringing to the story and that \\'Hey, we can add new stuff to the canon\\' kind of attitude will serve us well,\" Lee says.\\n\\nBatman/Superman goes back to the beginning of their long relationship, with a young crime-fighting Dark Knight new on the Gotham City scene and the Man of Steel fresh off the Smallville farm and making a name for himself as a budding journalist — Clark Kent, of course — and fledgling working-class hero of the people.\\n\\nPak feels that Superman\\'s appeal as a cultural mainstay since 1938 is the same as what\\'s behind the popularity of Spider-Man, Harry Potter and the X-Men.\\n\\n\"They\\'re all about outsiders,\" the writer says. \"As you grow up, you try to find your place in the world and you don\\'t belong and you struggle, and that\\'s the story of our lives, at least our adolescence.\\n\\n\"When you combine that with somebody who chooses to help, that becomes very powerful.\"\\n\\nThat he always sticks up for the underdog is another attractive quality to Pak.\\n\\n\"We want to be that strong and do the right thing and rise to the occasion. Superman gives us that kind of hope,\" he says. \"And then also he can smash whatever he wants to smash and he can set things on fire with his eyes. That\\'s pretty cool.\"\\n\\nJae Lee takes issue with anybody who deems Superman \"the ultimate boy scout\" or, even worse, boring.\\n\\n\"When you\\'re young and you have a character like that you can aspire to,\" he says, \"if you\\'re ever in a position where you end up having any kind of power but you live up to those ideals, what a wonderful world this place would be.\"\\n\\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/WCuFzD',\n",

       " 'TRENTON — Democratic lawmakers took aim at Gov. Chris Christie\\'s plan for the private sector to run the New Jersey Lottery, saying the 15-year contract currently on the table benefits the winning company more than New Jerseyans.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt a hearing of the Assembly Budget Committee today, Democrats and small business owners said the proposal needs more public input because the Lottery — a $2.6 billion business — has been well run over the years and thousands of small businesses could be hurt by the move.\\n\\n\\n\\nChristie wants to bid out the contract for $120 million over 15 years. The state would continue to own the Lottery, but the winning company would manage its sales and other operations and would be able to keep a hefty portion of any revenue gain.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf the state\\'s 130 Lottery employees, 60 to 65 could lose their jobs in the changeover, said Seth Hahn of the Communication Workers of America union. State officials have said they intend to have a new Lottery manager in place by mid-2013, though Christie delayed the process this year because of Hurricane Sandy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This latest proposal to monetize one of our most profitable and well-run assets is troubling to say the least,\" said Assemblyman Vincent Prieto (D-Hudson), the chairman of the Budget Committee. \"Privatization should be reserved for when the government cannot perform that function well on its own. In the case of our award-winning lottery system, we have one of the most efficient operations in the world.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Lottery is the fourth-largest source of revenue for the state, and has brought in more than $2.5 billion in ticket sales each year since 2007. In 2011, $930 million of its proceeds went toward scholarships and state education funds, psychiatric hospitals, centers for the developmentally disabled and homes for disabled veterans, officials have said.\\n\\n\\n\\nChristie\\'s plan requires no legislative approval, and lawmakers are not able to slow or stop it, but Prieto said \"there are too many questions unanswered.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This is a process that has really flown under the radar,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nRepublican lawmakers countered that all the contract documents have been available online for months. They welcomed the Christie administration\\'s plan, saying it was designed to maximize Lottery revenues and benefit all stakeholders in the end.\\n\\nSTAY CONNECTED 24/7 Download our Download our free NJ.com mobile and tablet apps to keep up with the latest New Jersey news, sports and entertainment.\\n\\n\"What we\\'re really looking at is a way to expand our Lottery\\'s scope and attract new members,\" said Assemblyman Anthony Bucco (R-Morris). “It is incumbent upon government to look for new ways to do things better and this administration has done that time and time again.\"\\n\\nBut Prieto said the state\\'s current network of 7,000 vendors may already have the gaming market fully covered. The contract being bid out by the state Treasury Department could allow the winning company to sell Lottery tickets online, a move that could end up poaching dollars from gas stations and convenience stores.\\n\\nSalvatore Risalvato, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline, Convenience Store and Automotive Association, said vendors only realize a 5 percent profit from Lottery tickets but that they usually make other, more profitable sales off of the same customers buying Lottery tickets.\\n\\nAssemblyman Gary Chiusano (R-Sussex) said that if Democrats were really worried about small businesses, they would not have passed a bill to increase the state\\'s minimum wage this week. Chiusano added that it\\'s unfortunate the state is pursuing more revenue from gamblers, whom he said are often lower-income residents.\\n\\n\"Simply put, New Jersey is not doing enough about problem gamblers,\" said Donald Weinbaum, executive director of the New Jersey Council on Compulsive Gambling. \"We have lagged behind other states on (this) public health issue.\"\\n\\nState officials at the Treasury and Lottery Commission declined to attend Prieto\\'s hearing today because they said it would be improper to weigh in on a pending bid.\\n\\nHowever, the Lottery\\'s executive director, Carole Hedinger, sent Prieto a letter on Tuesday saying his concerns were off-base and that the process has been transparent.\\n\\n\"Lottery is seeking to draw on the expertise of an experienced partner,\" Hedinger wrote, in order to remain \"innovative and responsive to a fast-changing marketplace.\"\\n\\nFollow @starledger\\n\\n\\n\\nRELATED COVERAGE\\n\\n• PolitiFact N.J.: Group says state lottery sent $930 million to New Jersey classrooms in 2011\\n\\n• Payout or gamble?

       " 'It\\'s 9.02am on Friday and I am being given a refresher course in live radio DJing by 6Music breakfast show host Shaun Keaveny.\\n\\n\"When I say, \\'Now,\\'\" says Shaun, \"press that button there. That red one.\" His producer, Lisa Kenlock, looks at us over the top of her computer screen. She is smiling, but her eyes are grave. Phil Smith, the other producer, and Matt Everitt, who does the music news, are also watching. Ooh, the pressure. \"Now!\" says Shaun. I press the button and M83\\'s \"Reunion\" segues into a 6Music trail. Everyone cheers. I curtsy and sit down. My work here is done.\\n\\nThis small stunt has come about because BBC Radio 6Music will turn 10 years old on 5 March. Happy birthday, the 6! Home of credible alternative music, of clever, off-beat, older presenters, 6 Music enters its second decade with its confidence and its listenership high – around 1.2 million regulars, tuning in for longer hours than ever before. But such upbeat days were born of tricky times; today\\'s easy-on-the-ear listen disguises the work behind the scenes. And so my job this morning is to observe how difficult live DJing is by watching Keaveny at work.\\n\\nUnfortunately, he makes everything look easy, biffing banter at Matt, picking up a guitar for an impromptu rendition of \"Wonderful Tonight\", interviewing a sleepy Brian Cox on the phone, composing two-line poems for Middle Age Shout Outs – all in between pressing the right buttons at the right times. Middle Age Shout Outs is a regular Friday morning item: listeners get in touch to say what they\\'re up to at the weekend and Shaun turns this into a dancehall-style rhyme. One listener informs that he\\'s going to buy a Henry hoover. \"Hoover with eyes/ It\\'s a pet surprise,\" raps Shaun. \"Cos they always scare dogs, don\\'t they, those hoovers?\"\\n\\nShaun has been on 6 since 2007 and in that time his show, and the station itself, has been through fundamental identity crises. Brought over from Xfm by then-controller Lesley Douglas, Keaveny spent his first year on Breakfast in a thorough-going funk. In those days, his show was followed by another Douglas protege, George Lamb, a talented broadcaster whose mickey-taking, urban geezer attitude was all wrong for the station – but got a lot of attention. Lamb played mad ragga tunes and shouted: \"Shabba!\" Shaun seethed and carefully wrote jokes into his script.\\n\\n\"Actually, I learnt a lot from George,\" he says now. \"Things about having more of a relationship with people you work with and with the listeners. I was brought up on overnights at Xfm where I was by myself. I didn\\'t have anyone to bounce off, so I used to script my links. I slowly learned to relax and create an environment where you can be spontaneous by including other people.\"\\n\\nThat inclusiveness, that sense of understanding between presenters, producers and audience is now part of 6\\'s DNA, as it is with all brilliant radio stations. But for 6, it came about through a series of calamities. So let\\'s go back to the start.\\n\\nAndrew Collins, who had the teatime show when 6Music began, and who still presents shows for the station, recalls the reason why the station is here at all. \"It was a canary-down-the-mineshaft thing,\" he says. \"The BBC, to its credit, thought the best way to publicise digital services was to create some digital stations. The Asian Network, 1Xtra, Radio 7 and 6Music came out of that.\"\\n\\nThen, the station felt anarchic, almost unknown, anonymous enough at least to be able to do what it wanted. Its producers were young and learning; its DJs were older, but still working out what to do, what 6 was for. Supposedly, it was a bridge between Radios 1 and 2, but it never felt like that. It felt more muso, more chin-scratchy, silly and sincere. And it was small. I was a stand-in presenter for a couple of shows and I thought I\\'d rely on listeners\\' emails for a sense of what to talk about. But only a handful of regulars got in touch (though those who did did a lot). 6 really was a niche concern.\\n\\nThe BBC was never going to let 6Music continue in its haphazard, stuff-the-audience-figures way. Douglas brought in Keaveny and Lamb to increase ratings and, supposedly, to appeal to women – but then had to resign, when another of her proteges, Russell Brand, brought the radio world crashing down with Sachsgate. Bob Shennan became 6\\'s controller. Though there were initial mutterings about his lack of music background (his longest previous stint was at 5 Live), Shennan has proved astute. His first move – to replace George Lamb with Lauren Laverne in 2009 – was inspired and he\\'s gradually tweaked the station, pruning the cutting-edge dance elements, growing the musician-turned-presenter pool (it now boasts Jarvis Cocker, Cerys Matthews, Guy Garvey and Huey Morgan among its roster), shaping it into the cool, sure-footed offering it is today.\\n\\nIt was in 2010, though, that 6Music really faced disaster. The BBC, asked to make massive savings by the government, proposed closing the station altogether. Or, if not, then turning it into Radio 2 Extra, broadcasting during the day and joining up with 2\\'s output in the evenings. It was a genuine threat and the reaction of listeners was huge. They marched on Broadcasting House, they sent petitions to Parliament, they marshalled support on Twitter and Facebook… And they won. The BBC Trust concluded that the station must continue. And the trust\\'s codicil – that 6 must employ more DJs who knew their music – was even more of a validation.\\n\\nThe boost to the station was immense. Not only did the protest serve as a publicity campaign, doubling 6\\'s audience in a matter of weeks, but it gave the whole place a status, an \"approved by\" legitimacy. \"The station being threatened, and then saved, changed everything,\" remembers Shaun. \"It brought the best out of everyone and made us realise how culturally significant 6Music is. We knew we were part of something that everyone believed in.\"\\n\\nThis new confidence made Shennan\\'s subsequent high-profile hirings – stars such as Jarvis Cocker, veterans such as Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie – seem natural. Now 6Music feels, if not like a cringe-worthy family a la Radio 1, like a bunch of people who understand one another. A collective that gets it, that represents a small, but significant, segment of Britain\\'s population.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not like we\\'re all going out in central London getting drunk together,\" says Keaveny of the 6Music team. \"We\\'re all quite old. We\\'ve got lives, families, some people are up in Manchester. But we\\'ve all got respect for what everybody does. We\\'ve all got the same attitude to life. And so have the listeners. Some people get to their 40s and become entrenched, start reading the Daily Mail and listening to Magic FM. But if you\\'ve still got a restless intellect, you\\'re still excited by life, you\\'re still reading books, you\\'re perhaps a person who\\'s started a record-playing evening at your local pub… that\\'s what everyone\\'s like at 6. That\\'s why we all get on.\"',\n",
       " 'John Ford couldn\\'t have staged it better. There was Cowboy George disappearing into the sunset, draggling a few twigs of Crawford brush behind him, while Old Man McCain, patriarch of Sedona Ranch -- or one of those dang houses, never could remember which -- was waving him off with relief. And suddenly there she was -- out of the Alaskan blue -- Cowgirl Sarah, twirling her guns and cocking her jaw like Clint Eastwood in full attack mode, a loner out for justice.\\n\\nDespite all the chants for change in both camps, those Repubs know that nothing speaks louder than that old reliable cowboy image honed by generations of Hollywood directors like Ford, beloved by generations of city-bred Winchester and Marlboro men like Cheney, and adopted by every president since cowboy actor Ronald Reagan put on boots and spurs.\\n\\nBut Cowboy George nearly wrecked the genre. It was just bad casting. Despite the learned strut and the put-on twang, he never could get the hang of looking real. He was always Preppie Cowboy. Seemed like he\\'d ruined the getup for good, until McCain\\'s gut told him to just shift the whole cowboy thing onto his sidekick. Like the Lone Ranger saying, \"Here Tonto, you be the Maverick.\" How many times on the convention platform did Palin\\'s fellow Repubs describe her as a gun-totin\\', rootin-tootin\\' pistol- packin\\' mama of five-- a maverick, rebel, outsider? \"We\\'ve now got two crack-shots leading our ticket,\" shouted one delegate. But actually, she\\'s riding point as the gunshooter, letting patriarch John run the ranch.\\n\\nThe Repubs have been mining Hollywood images to beat the band, and they\\'ve now got the bases covered. There\\'s Mama McCain, typecast at age ninety-six to play that tough pioneer mother who crossed the plains in covered wagon while her husband fought off Injuns. There\\'s Cindy McCain, looking like an older sister of those gals in \"Sex and the City,\" wearing their million-dollar fantasy fashions on their backs, feet and ears. And there\\'s Cowgirl Sarah riding tall in the saddle, amblin\\' in from a small town in the remotest stretches of the West, to set the country straight at last after eight years of gov\\'ment bad guys.\\n\\nBut wait a minute -- weren\\'t the Republicans in charge?\\n\\nWe got an image problem here, or worse, a script problem. From the beginning, cowgirls were strictly from showbiz, not reality. No woman, not even Calamity Jane, was ever actually allowed to herd cows on the Chisholm or any other trail. While Buffalo Bill Cody could make a star in 1885 of little Annie Oakley (real name Phoebe Ann Moses), it was because she was a sharpshooter, not a rider or roper. As rodeos burgeoned in the next century, a number of showbiz gals like Prairie Rose Henderson got fame as \"cowgirls\" when they wore fancy costumes while riding a bucking horse. But they were kicked out in 1936, when rodeo cowboys under Gene Autry organized their first professional guild. From then on, girls were relegated to the roles of rodeo queens or half-time showgirls or, most ignominious of all, barrel racers.',\n",

Even so, the quick heat blast eliminates more than 99 percent of the bacteria left behind after pasteurization.\\n\\n“The developed technology uses low temperature, short time (LTST) in a process that disperses milk in the form of droplets with low heat/pressure variation over a short treatment time in conjunction with pasteurization,” Bruce Applegate, Purdue’s associate professor in the Department of Food Science, explained to Digital Trends. “The resultant product was subjected to a taste panel and participants had equal or greater preference for the LTST pasteurized milk compared to normally pasteurized milk. The shelf was determined to be a minimum of two weeks longer than the standard shelf life from pasteurization alone.”\\n\\nSo is this some fascinating research project which won’t hit shelves for the foreseeable future? Apparently not. “Currently an Ohio-based milk processor is using this technology and distributing the milk,” Applegate says. “The unit is approved for processing milk in Ohio and distribution nationwide. The product is currently being distributed, however it has not been labeled as extended shelf life milk. Once the commercial application is validated the milk will be labelled with the extended shelf life.”\\n\\nSorry Louis Pasteur, you may have met your match. And we no longer have to fear our housemates’ penchant for keeping ten-day-old milk hanging around the apartment…',\n",
       " 'Thousands of DNA samples from innocent people are currently retained Two British men should not have had their DNA and fingerprints retained by police, the European Court of Human Rights has ruled. The men\\'s information was held by South Yorkshire Police, although neither was convicted of any offence. The judgement could have major implications on how DNA records are stored in the UK\\'s national database. The judges said keeping the information \"could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society\". Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said she was \"disappointed\" by the European Court of Human Rights\\' decision. The database may now have to be scaled back following the unanimous judgement by 17 senior judges from across Europe. Under present laws, the DNA profiles of everyone arrested for a recordable offence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are kept on the database, regardless of whether they are charged or convicted. Discriminatory The details of about 4.5m people are held and one in five of them does not have a current criminal record. Both men were awarded £36,400 (42,000 Euros) in costs, less the money already paid in legal aid. The existing law will remain in place while we carefully consider the judgement\\n\\nJacqui Smith, Home Secretary\\n\\nSend us your comments DNA ruling resonates in UK The court found that the police\\'s actions were in violation of Article 8 - the right to respect for private and family life - of the European Convention on Human Rights. It also said it was \"struck by the blanket and indiscriminate nature of the power of retention in England and Wales\". The judges ruled the retention of the men\\'s DNA \"failed to strike a fair balance between the competing public and private interests,\" and that the UK government \"had overstepped any acceptable margin of appreciation in this regard\". The court also ruled \"the retention in question constituted a disproportionate interference with the applicants\\' right to respect for private life and could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society\". \\'Privacy protection\\' The home secretary said: \"DNA and fingerprinting is vital to the fight against crime, providing the police with more than 3,500 matches a month. \"The government mounted a robust defence before the court and I strongly believe DNA and fingerprints play an invaluable role in fighting crime and bringing people to justice. \"The existing law will remain in place while we carefully consider the judgement.\" FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.\\n\\nMore from Today programme Solicitor Peter Mahy, who represented the men, said that the decision will have far-reaching implications. \"It will be very interesting to see how the UK government respond. \"The government should now start destroying the DNA records of those people who are currently on the DNA database and who are innocent of any crime.\" Human rights group Liberty said it welcomed the court\\'s decision. Director Shami Chakrabarti said: \"This is one of the most strongly worded judgements that Liberty has ever seen from the Court of Human Rights. \"That court has used human rights principles and common sense to deliver the privacy protection of innocent people that the British government has shamefully failed to deliver.\" \\'Invasion of privacy\\' Phil Booth, of the NO2ID group, which campaigns against identity cards, said: \"\\'This is a victory for liberty and privacy. \"Though these judgements are always complicated and slow in coming, it is a vindication of what privacy campaigners have said all along. \"The principle that we need to follow is simple - when charges are dropped suspect samples are destroyed. No charge, no DNA.\" The Nuffield Council on Bioethics reports on the ethical questions raised by recent advances in biological and medical research. Its director, Hugh Whittall, said: \"We agree wholeheartedly with this ruling. The DNA of innocent people should not be kept by police. \"People feel it is an invasion of their privacy, and there is no evidence that removing from the DNA database people who have not been charged or convicted will lead to serious crimes going undetected. \"The government now has an obligation to bring its own policies into line.\" Rights breach claim One of the men who sought the ruling in Strasbourg, Michael Marper, 45, was arrested in 2001. He was charged with harassing his partner but the case was later dropped. He had no previous convictions. The other man - a teenager identified as \"S\" - was arrested and charged with attempted robbery but later acquitted. In both cases the police refused to destroy fingerprints and DNA samples taken when the men were taken in to custody. The men went to the European Court of Human Rights after their cases were thrown out by the House of Lords. They argued that retaining their DNA profiles is discriminatory and breaches their right to a private life. The government claims the DNA profile from people who are not convicted may sometimes be linked to later offences, so storing the details on the database is a proportionate response to tackling crime. Scotland already destroys DNA samples taken during criminal investigations from people who are not charged or who are later acquitted of alleged offences. The Home Office has already set up a \"contingency planning group\" to look into the potential implications arising from a ruling in favour of the men.\\n\\n\\n\\nBookmark with: Delicious\\n\\nDigg\\n\\nreddit\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nStumbleUpon What are these?

       " \"Share\\n\\nWhether it’s your smartphone keeping track of your favorite takeaway restaurants, or your Web browser keeping tabs on which websites you visit most often, there’s probably a piece of technology in your home that’s learning about you.\\n\\nAs computers transform from tools to assistants over the coming years, the learning needs of the technology we use on a daily basis are going to grow exponentially. These services will be more sophisticated and reach much further than today — but they’re going to have to get a lot smarter before they do.\\n\\nComputer systems, artificial intelligence, and helper robots will need to hit the books on a whole host of topics — human conversation, cultural norms, social etiquette, and more. Today’s scientists are teaching AI the lessons they’ll need to help tomorrow’s users, and the course schedule isn’t what you’d expect.\\n\\nThe first steps toward smarter AI\\n\\nLast year, within the confines of the Human-Robot Interaction Laboratory at Boston’s Tufts University, a small robot approached the edge of a table. Upon reaching this precipice, the robot noted that the surface it was walking on had come to an end, and told its operator, “Sorry, I cannot do that.”\\n\\nIn doing so, the machine confirmed that the work carried out by Matthias Scheutz and Gordon Briggs had been a success. The pair had set out to give their robot the ability to reject a request laid out by a human operator, with their test subject’s tabletop act of self-preservation being a demonstration of the system at work.\\n\\nScheutz and Briggs’ project is part of a crucial branch of research into artificial intelligence. Human-robot interaction — sometimes referred to as HRI — is an essential element of our continued work toward the practical application of AI. It’s easy to forget, with robots still largely a hypothetical concern for most, that these machines will one day have to integrate with the humans that they’re intended to assist.\\n\\nTeaching a robot how to walk is one thing. Teaching that same robot when it’s safe to cross a road is quite different. That’s the core of the project carried out by Scheutz and Briggs. They wanted to give a robot the ability to reject orders it’s given, if it seems that carrying out the task would cause it harm.\\n\\nTo a human, this might seem like an implicit element of the action of moving around. But robots don’t have “common sense.”\\n\\nImportance of the word ‘no’\\n\\nTeaching a robot to refuse an order that sends it plunging to its doom is of obvious benefit to the robot, and also to whoever owns it. But its importance reaches far deeper. Helping a robot say “no” means helping it learn to judge the implications of its actions.\\n\\n“The same way we do not want humans to blindly follow instructions from other humans, we do not want instructible robots to carry out human orders without checking what the effects are,” Scheutz told Digital Trends.\\n\\nWe have to teach robots to disobey commands that are not ethically sound.\\n\\n“Instructions can be inappropriate in a given situation for many reasons,” he continued, “but most importantly because they could cause harm to humans or damage property, including the robot itself. By reasoning about possible outcomes of an instructed action, the robot might be able to detect potential norm violations and potential harm resulting from the action, and could attempt to mitigate them.”\\n\\nEssentially, when the robot receives its instruction to walk forward, it checks that request against the information it has at hand. If anything seems fishy, the robot can then raise its concerns to the human operator, eventually rejecting the command outright if the instructor has no extra data to calm its fears.\\n\\nThe scientific process doesn’t make for as catchy a headline as the threat of a robot uprising to us humans. Tabloid newspapers like the Daily Mail reported on Scheutz’s work with a cartoonish headline speculating about our species’ impending subjugation at the hands of robot overlords. We here at DT are known to joke about the robot apocalypse, too. It’s usually in good fun, but in cases like this, it can harm researchers ability to get their message out.\\n\\n“There will always be responses that take research out of context and focus on what seems uncomfortable for us, such as the idea of robots disobeying our commands,” Scheutz said in response to the Daily Mail report. “However, the key aspect of our research that such catchy headlines ignore is to teach robot to reject commands that are not ethically sound — and only those. Not to be disobedient in general.”\\n\\nWhat if, for example, a small boy told a household robot to dump hot coffee over his little brother as a prank? Ensuring that this couldn’t take place is vital to the success of any company producing such technology for the consumer market, and it’s only possible if the robot has a broad database of social and ethical norms to reference alongside its ability to say “no.”\\n\\nAdding layers of complexity\\n\\nHumans know to stop walking when approaching a steep drop, or why it’s inappropriate to douse an infant in hot coffee. Our experiences have told us what is dangerous, and what’s just mean. Whether we’ve done or been told about something in the past, we can draw upon the information we have stored away to inform our behavior in a new situation.\\n\\nRobots can solve problems based on the same principle. But we’ve yet to produce a computer that can learn like a human — and even then, learning ethics is a process that takes years. Robots must have a lifetime of information available to them before they’re unleashed out into the world.\\n\\nThe scale of this work is staggering, far beyond what many might expect. As well as teaching the robot how to fulfill whatever task they’re being sent out to do, there’s an added layer of complexity offered up by the many intricacies of human-robot interaction.\\n\\nAndrew Moore is the Dean of the School of Computer Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. In that role he provides support for a group 2,000 students and faculty members, many of whom are working in fields related to robotics, machine learning, and AI.\\n\\n“We’re responsible for helping figure out what the year 2040 is going to be like to live in,” he told me. “So we’re also responsible for making sure that 2040 is a very good year to live in.” Given that it’s likely that helper robots will play a role in that vision of the future, Moore has plenty of experience in the relationship between machine and user. To give an idea of how that bond is going to evolve in the coming years, he uses the familiar example of the smartphone assistant.\\n\\nToday, many of us carry a smartphone that’s able to answer questions like “who is the current President of the United States?” and more complex queries like “how tall are the President of the United States’ daughters?” Soon, we’ll see actions based on these questions become commonplace. You might ask your phone to order a new package of diapers, for instance.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the next stage of development, Moore put forward a seemingly innocuous example question. “Do I have time to go grab a coffee before my next meeting?”\\n\\nMore on AI: Machine learning algorithm puts the words of George W. Bush in Barack Obama’s mouth\\n\\n“Under the hood, there’s a lot of knowledge that has to get to the computer in order for the computer to answer the question,” Moore said. While today’s technology can understand the question, the system needs a lot of data to answer. What’s the line like at the coffee shop? How is traffic? What kind of drink does the user usually order? Giving the computer access to this data presents its own challenges.\\n\\nAI systems will need access to a huge amount of information — some of which is cast in stone, some of which is changing all the time — simply to carry out the complex tasks we’ll expect from them in just a few years.\\n\\nMoore illustrates this point by comparing the tone of voice a person might take when speaking to their boss’ boss, or an old friend. Somewhere in your data banks, there’s a kernel of information that tells you that the former should be treated with certain social cues that aren’t as necessary when talking to the latter.\\n\\nIf you ask Google to show red dresses, and one of the results is a toaster, the whole thing falls apart.\\n\\nIt’s simple stuff for a human, but something that has to be instilled in AI. And the more pressing the task, the more important precision becomes. Asking an assistant if you have coffee is one thing. But what if you were hurt, and needed to know which hospital could be reached most quickly — and possibly needed a robots help to reach it? A mistake suddenly becomes life-threatening.\\n\\n“It’s actually quite easy to write a machine learning program where you train it with lots of examples,” said Moore. “When you’ve done that work, you end up with a model. That works pretty well, and when we build a system like that, we talk about ‘accuracy’ and use phrases like ‘precision’ and ‘recall.’ The interesting thing is, it’s pretty straightforward to get things that are correct 19 times out of 20.”\\n\\n“For many applications, that’s sort-of good enough. But, in many other applications — especially when there’s safety involved, or where you’re asking very complicated questions — you really need your system to have 99.9 percent accuracy.”\\n\\nUser trust is also an issue. “[If] you ask Google ‘show me the 15 most popular red dresses’ and it throws up the results and just one of them is actually a toaster, then the whole thing falls apart. The users stop trusting it.” A user who loses trust in a robot is likely to stop using it entirely.\\n\\nTeaching common knowledge\\n\\nEven disregarding the specific tasks any individual implementation is designed to achieve, robots and AIs will need a huge amount of basic knowledge to operate in the wild. Everything from social cues to safety regulations must be imprinted upon machine brains to ensure their success.\\n\\nFortunately, other fields are lending a hand in some elements of this computational curriculum. “With things like navigation, and with human facial expression analysis, there is an existing scientific discipline which actually has a lot of real data,” said Moore. Individual research projects can often be re-purposed, too.\\n\\n“The algorithms we are working on are general,” Matthias Scheutz told me, referring to the research he and Gordon Briggs led at Tufts University. “They can be applied in any domain, as long as the robot has the necessary representations of actions and norms for that domain.”\\n\\nModules that could give a robot the ability to recognize human expressions, or stop short of falling off a table, certainly have their uses. However, each would cater to a very small part of a machine’s basic requirements for operating unsupervised. A generalized OS could present a basic level of common knowledge that could be easily shared between different implementations.\\n\\n“One of the major funders of this kind of work is a group that’s funded many other things that turned out to be important,” said Moore. “That’s DARPA. They have a number of big projects going in what they call ‘common knowledge for robotics.'”\\n\\nIf AIs and helper robots are going to become a reality in the not-too-distant future, some version of this ‘common knowledge for robotics’ platform is likely to be a crucial component. It might even be the key to broad mainstream adoption.\\n\\nThere’s plenty of work to be done before there’s a knowledge base that can support the first wave of consumer robots. The end product might be years away, but the foundations needed to facilitate its creation aren’t science fiction.\",\n",
       " 'The year I moved away, George W. Bush stood beneath a “Mission Accomplished” banner on an aircraft carrier and declared an end to major combat operations in Iraq. Facebook hadn’t yet been turned into a company. The iPhone did not exist. I left before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, before Detroit went bankrupt. I missed the Great Recession (though I am still living the European translation of it). I missed most of the last two presidencies. I missed Brangelina.\\n\\nInstead, I witnessed from the other side the global forces that would bring profound changes to America. I visited industrial regions of southern China where the ground seemed to vibrate under the weight and bustle of all the countless new factories. Once iPhones had been invented, it was Chinese workers who assembled them. I watched Bangladeshi seamstresses stitch clothes sold at Walmart. American consumers benefited from the cheaper goods, but American manufacturers did not. Between January 2000 and December 2014, the United States lost roughly five million manufacturing jobs.\\n\\nThen I moved to Rome and watched the European Union grow ineffective and paralyzed, as the dream of a vibrant, unified Europe seemed to wither. Democracy was losing ground in Hungary and the Philippines; it had all but surrendered in Russia. Syria became a slaughterhouse. The Islamic State dispatched terrorists around the world. China’s politics became more oppressive, as President Xi Jinping cracked down on dissent and nurtured a Maoist-style cult of personality. Economic globalization was supposed to accelerate political liberalization around the world, but instead authoritarianism appeared to be on the rise. The West, it seemed, had failed to anticipate the possibility that globalization could contribute to the destabilization of — or pose a threat to — democracy, even in the United States.\\n\\nThis summer, I decided I wanted to explore this place that had become a foreign country to me. I didn’t understand what had happened since I left, why so many people seemed so disillusioned and angry. I planned a zigzag route, revisiting places where I once lived or worked, a 29-day sprint through 11 states (and four time zones). I knew I would be moving too fast to make any sweeping declaration about the state of America, and I wouldn’t ask people which presidential candidate they were voting for. I was more interested in why they were so anxious about the present and the future. I wanted to find out why the country was fragmenting rather than binding together. Most of all I wanted to see with my own eyes what had changed — and so much had changed.\\n\\nBy the time I arrived in Washington in late July, the notion that American democracy could come unmoored was not being easily laughed off. Before beginning my journey in earnest, I paid a visit to Patrick J. Buchanan at his white mansion near the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Northern Virginia. I’d thought of Buchanan often over the last year, as Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination. In 1992, I covered Buchanan during a campaign stop in Macomb County, outside Detroit, when he was a Republican insurgent running for president, the Trump of that era. He mocked Republican elites, denounced free trade and globalization, antagonized minorities and vowed to build a “Buchanan fence” along the Mexican border. Buchanan’s nostalgia for the era of white-majority America was often interpreted, not without cause, as barely concealed racism. He lost in 1992, and again in 1996 and 2000, but he always predicted that his issues and his angry coalition would endure.',\n",

       " 'An alien ship lands on Earth. Its occupant gets raised as human, hiding special abilities for fear of reprisal. But when the superpowered extraterrestrial becomes an adult, Truth, Justice and the American Way mean something very different. Because this strange visitor from another planet is black.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1993, a company called Milestone Media released a slate of comic-book series set in a multicultural universe where most of the heroes were black. With the exception of magazine editor Derek T. Dingle, Milestone’s founders—Christopher Priest, Michael Davis, Denys Cowan and Dwayne McDuffie—were all comics industry veterans who’d worked at Marvel and DC. Their collective desire to broaden the horizons of the medium’s characters and readership led them to come together and form Milestone. In the work that followed—published and distributed by DC Comics—the good guys and bad guys who battled in the in a fictional midwestern city called Dakota came from a multitude of ethnicities and walks of life. Characters in titles like Blood Syndicate, Heroes, and Deathwish were trailblazing efforts to conceptualize superheroes who were vessels for gender fluidity, loving same-sex relationships and socioeconomic tension. The subtext was never so heavy-handed as to take away from the well-crafted superhero yarns.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOne of the first books that Milestone put out into the world was Icon, featuring a superstrong, cape-wearing flying hero with a young sidekick named Rocket. The series’ first issue introduces Icon’s secret identity of Augustus Freeman, a politically conservative African-American lawyer who’s been alive for more than 150 years.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFreeman is really an alien; he assumed human traits because his alien escape pod landed in the Deep South in 1839 and imprinted on the DNA of the field slave who became his adopted mother. If you need a modern-day reference for Augustus’ politics, think of someone like Herman Cain or Ben Carson. His bubble of complacency gets burst by a home invasion robbery, which he uses superhuman abilities to stop.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRaquel Ervin is one of the teens who tried to rob Freeman and, weeks after seeing him take to the sky, the Toni Morrison-wannabe decides that Augustus is going to be a superhero and she’s going to be his sidekick.\\n\\n\\n\\nCo-created and written by McDuffie with art by M.D. “Doc” Bright, Icon represented an intentional shift from how the black heroes of previous decades were presented. Augustus Freeman wasn’t “street” and didn’t traffic in the jivey slang that characterized Luke Cage and other inner-city crimefighters. Icon #1 established one of the ongoing themes that series would touch, an exploration of what individuals and society owe each other. Raquel’s low-income realities don’t afford her the resources to make her dreams of becoming a writer come true while Augustus realizes that his upper-class elitism has cut him off from the world around him. He’s so out of touch that he thinks he can just fly down and offer his help to the cops dealing with a hostage situation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHe is, of course, very wrong.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI was in college when the Milestone line debuted, gobsmacked by the idea that there was going to be a whole universe of non-white superheroes. My excitement led me to do a project on the imprint for a cultural journalism class taught by the late, trailblazing pop music critic Ellen Willis. I remember a dismissive classmate sniffing at Icon, saying “So, he’s basically like a black Superman, then?” I didn’t always speak up a lot in college, the confidence that I have now in my faculties was still a long time coming. (I’m forever haunted by an asshole TA in a PoliSci class who ranted that “crack was a black drug” because it was years before I realized I could’ve retorted by asking him how crack got to the inner cities.) But when that classmate made his shallow remark about Icon, I said “No, he’s not a black Superman. And the book is about exactly why he can’t be.” I didn’t know I could say something like that until I actually said it. Something was waking up in me.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe late, legendary Dwayne McDuffie knew the possibilities of superhero comics. At their best, they can portray humanity in all its messy fullness, so that when our loftiest ideals win out over our worst aspects we’d feel that much closer to the heroes we read about. Augustus is uptight and judgmental, sheltered by his success. His turn towards understanding the generations that came after him is a journey back to empathy and community. He’s a Superman analog who isn’t already perfect; he’s perfecting himself.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGreat as that debut issue is, it’s Icon #16 that gave me life. It pit the title character against Superman, in a fight that the most powerful character in the Milestone universe couldn’t let the first superhero ever win. Underneath all the “good guys meet then throw down” pyrotechnics was a powerful meditation on how both marginalizers and the marginalized lose in American society.\\n\\nThe issue was part of the Worlds Collide crossover, which had characters from Milestone’s parallel universe meet various members of the Superman family of comics. The event revolved around a being named Rift, the cosmically empowered gestalt of a man who existed in both realities.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRift decides that only one universe can survive and, in Icon #16, he makes the Man of Steel and the Hero of Dakota battle on behalf of the cities they protect. McDuffie writes Rift as a deluded creation deity, musing over the origins of Superman...\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nand Icon.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI’ve never forgotten the two sequences where Rift talks about how each hero was and wasn’t able to participate in society at large. The term “white privilege” wasn’t in popular usage, yet McDuffie uses the characters as metaphors for practices that have been around for centuries.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSuperman is as alien as Icon. In fact, if you factor in the fact that Icon’s lived on Earth and in America for 150 years compared to Superman’s 30-something age, you could argue that Augustus Freeman is even more American than Clark Kent. But Kal-El enjoys a privilege that Icon doesn’t. The privilege is in being able to be thought of as fully human, to have your mind, body, wants, and needs be deemed of equal worth to those of the folks in power. The privilege is being able to be something more than three-fifths of a man, more than a tool, a foil or a means to an end.\\n\\nWhen I interviewed McDuffie years ago, it was clear that he wanted readers to think about these themes:\\n\\n“...I’m conscious of race whenever I’m writing, just as I’m conscious of class, religion, human psychology, politics—everything that makes up the human experience. I don’t think I can do a good job if I’m not paying attention to what’s meaningful to people, and in American culture, there isn’t anything that informs human interaction more than the idea of race.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe end of Icon #16 has Rift realizing that there is essentially a stalemate between the two heroes because they’re connected symbiotically.\\n\\n\\n\\nIcon #16 still stands out all these years later because it’s a work that does more than just comment on the need for black representation in mainstream superhero comics. It told America about itself via one of its biggest pop culture icons, hopefully making it consider all the black supermen and superwomen who were icons in lives that they may never have known about.\\n\\nAdvertisement',\n",
       " 'Special Counsel Robert Mueller‘s investigation is reportedly taking a hard look at whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey in the middle of the FBI’s probe of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russian interference in last year’s election. A source told ABC News that Mueller’s team is asking the Department of Justice to turn over emails related to Comey’s firing.\\n\\nThe records request, reportedly made within the last month, seeks records of communications between DOJ employees, but also communications between DOJ officials and White House officials. This could shed light on whether Trump or his office tried to impact the investigation, which could be against the law.\\n\\nMueller’s investigation is also reportedly looking into records related to Attorney General Jeff Sessions‘ decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Early on, Sessions said he would not involve himself with the probe due to his own ties to the Trump campaign. Nevertheless, he was said to have input on President Trump’s decision to fire Comey. Any records related to this could show to what degree Sessions was involved in the decision, and whether or not it broke his recusal.\\n\\nWith Sessions on the sidelines, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the Acting AG for the Russia investigation. As such, Rosenstein is the only one with the power to fire Mueller, should he deem it appropriate. He has gone on record saying he would not do so, absent good cause. Rosenstein also wrote a recommendation to Trump supporting Comey’s dismissal.\\n\\n[Image via screengrab]\\n\\nFollow Ronn Blitzer on Twitter @RonnBlitzer',\n",

The vote was 217-205 on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe vote marked the first chance for lawmakers to take a stand on the secret surveillance program since former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden leaked classified documents last month that spelled out the monumental scope of the government\\'s activities.\\n\\nRepublican Representative Justin Amash had challenged the program as an indiscriminate collection of phone records, saying his effort was to defend the U.S. Constitution and \"defend the privacy of every American.\"\\n\\nThe issue created unusual political coalitions in Washington, with the Obama administration, national security leaders in Congress and the Republican establishment facing off against libertarian-leaning conservatives and some liberal Democrats.\\n\\nThe measure faces strong opposition in the Senate and from the White House and is unlikely to survive in a final spending bill.

Keith Alexander, made last-minute appeals to lawmakers, urging them to oppose the amendment.

       " 'Gameplay Pt. 2\\n\\nKey Picks\\n\\nCommunication\\n\\nUnlocks\\n\\nKey picks are kills on players that are considered \"key\" to the game, which is pretty much always the demo and medic. However, in some cases a soldier or scout could be so dominant that taking them down would help you more than killing their sub-par demoman. Killing these types is pretty straight forward, so I\\'ll cover the former two:This mostly comes down to keeping track of ubers. When your team ubers with a close advantage, you\\'ll usually want to jump over the two front lines fighting it out and kill the medic before he gets uber and pops when your uber runs out. Another example would be when you\\'re ready to push last and their medic has 80%. If I know their medic is close to having uber and I see they\\'re at least one player down, I pretty much always go straight in for the medic. If they have all players up, I\\'ll ask my team first. I do this because even if I completely bungle it and don\\'t get anything done, it will be 5v5 and so the other team will not push out of their last. Then I respawn and we can push in with uber advantage (or not if I messed up).Demomen are pretty much always good picks, but there are times when this is especially so. For instance, your team won mid decisively and is flowing into their yard to cap 2nd, and you know their demo is somewhere setting a forward trap without much protection since half his team is down. Take this opportunity to flank him and take him out. Doing this will let your team walk into their space between last and 2nd (usually a lobby area) without worrying about a trap, and then straight into last with no stickies on point.Technically, a roaming soldier can get away with only comming jumps and damage done, but I like to comm where I am and if I\\'m going to try something I\\'ll tell my team what I intend to do. I\\'ll break these four up and cover them in a little more detail.Always tell your team when you\\'re jumping at the other team. Even better, tell them in advance. For instance, \"I\\'m jumping their med in 5.\" This lets your team know you\\'re jumping in 5 seconds, and that you\\'ll be gunning for the enemy medic. Then the rest of your team has that time to get in position to follow up on your jump. Sometimes, you\\'ll end up in a position where you\\'re suddenly staring at the enemy team and don\\'t have time wait around to make sure you\\'re team is ready. In this case, just tell them you\\'re jumping, and try to include where you\\'re jumping to. Example: \"I\\'m jumping Demo on side-spire.\"Like with jumps, calling damage lets your team follow up and pick off weak players. Some damage shouldn\\'t be called though, which is usually the damage done when both teams are holding. If you hit a scout for 60 and none of your team mates can get to him before he retreats, you\\'ll just be cluttering up the comms by calling that damage. However, if this scout is the only one holding their flank, you could tell your team that and get your flank to quickly push up and take over their flank. Generally though, you\\'ll want to be calling damage at mid fights and during bombs. Alternatively, instead of calling out specific damage after damaging a player, you can also tell your team to focus that specific player. For example, if you hit the demo for 120 in a last point fight, instead of saying \"demo took 120\", you could say \"focus demo\". One advantage of this is that it\\'s more of an order than a random piece of information, so your team could be more inclined to act on it.I\\'ll usually call my location and the location of nearby friendly scouts whenever there\\'s a slight lull in the comms. This lets our combo know how our flank is, and lets them make better decisions on what to do next. The last thing you want is the combo and the flank having no idea where the other is or what they\\'re doing. You can also call the location of players on the other team, but try to keep it to calling locations that aren\\'t obvious. For instance, if your team is building uber on mid, there\\'s no point in saying the other team is in yard, because it\\'s obvious that they\\'d be there. However, if they\\'re not there, you should call it. Basically, call all abnormal enemy positions, and call any flanking manuevers.The same idea as calling jumps. If you\\'re going to try something, let your team know. Bonus points for telling your team what to do and when. One good example of this is when you\\'re holding your 2nd point on granary and you and your scouts take down their flank. When this happens, you can let your team know their flank is wiped, and that you\\'ll be coming into left yard from right yard with your scouts, and tell your combo to push forwards. This means you\\'ll be pinning the enemy combo between your combo pushing forwards, and your flank wrapping around behind them. This will usually wipe their entire team, and also happens to be very satisfying to pull off.The loadout nearly everyone uses all of the time is the standard rocket launcher or the Original, shotgun or gunboats, and the Escape Plan. I\\'ll cover these and some lesser used ones here. If an unlock isn\\'t listed here, it\\'s either banned in the main leagues, or not worth using.The most commonly used primary for several good reasons: it has splash damage, has four rockets loaded, and the rocket travel speeds is optimal for rocket jumping.Basically the same as the above, except rockets fire from the center. Neither is better than the other, so try both and see which you like. However, keep in mind that with the Original you\\'ll have to aim further right when rocket jumping, and not as far to the left.This doesn\\'t get much playtime (unless you\\'re Seanbud), but if the other team has two extremely aggressive soldiers, it can be whipped out occasionally.Never really gets used in 6v6, mostly due to one less rocket loaded, but I believe it\\'s gaining popularity in Highlander. Generally, it\\'s better to have that extra rocket than it is to gain a little bit of health.One of the two \"primary secondaries\", the other being the Gunboats. Very effective for finishing off enemies, or just killing them outright. One good habit to pick up is hitting an opponent with one good rocket, then switching to your shotgun to finish the job.A very handy unlock, letting you rocket jump all over the place with minimal self-damage. However, in my experience its most valuable for surprise med picks. If you run into a pocket and he hits you for 160 damage, he\\'s most likely not going to be expecting you to jump over his head at his medic. With the gunboats, this is exactly what you\\'ll be able to do.Generally, a good rule to follow is Gunboats on offence, Shotgun on defence. However, that is if you like using the Gunboats. Running full-time Shotgun is perfectly viable as well. For me, it depends on the map. On a map that has tons of different ways to jump around, such as Badlands, I\\'ll mostly run Gunboats. On a map like Gullywash, I tend to run full-time Shotgun, because from my experience there isn\\'t a whole lot of jump chains to be done.Great for rollouts, or getting to a health pack faster. Contrary to popular belief, it\\'s not very useful for getting away. Unless the other team is awful, you\\'re probably not going to get away with 10 HP.I\\'ve come to really like this unlock, though it\\'s a little like the Gunboats: works best on jump-friendly maps. When you wipe the flank or just find an opening, backcapping will put much more pressure on the other team because of the 2x capture speed, and occassionally you\\'ll be able to sneak a round win in the middle of a last point fight.',\n",

Watertown, Massachusetts is five and one half miles from the scene of the Boston Marathon bombing and is a community of approximately 32,000 Souls. The Massachusetts National Guard has responded to the incident sending in several Humvees and placing troops on the streets to assure the citizens of Watertown, Massachusetts stay sheltered in place.The two suspects are alleged to have robbed a local 7 Eleven, shot and killed an MIT Police Officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and attempted a carjacking on a driver in a Mercedes.

       " 'Pathological gamblers have a stronger brain reaction to so-called near-miss events: losing events that come very close to a win. Neuroscientists of the Donders Institute at Radboud University show this in fMRI scans of twenty-two pathological gamblers and just as many healthy controls. The scientific journal Neuropsychopharmacology published their results in an early view article last week.\\n\\nDespite being objective losses, near-misses activate a particular reward-related area in the middle of our brain: the striatum. In the current study, neuroscientist Guillaume Sescousse and his colleagues show that this activity is amplified in pathological gamblers. When compared to healthy controls, pathological gamblers show more activity in the striatum after a near-miss event, than after a complete-miss event (see Figure). This activity is thought to reinforce gambling behaviour, supposedly by fostering an illusion of control on the game.\\n\\nTo obtain these results, Sescousse compared fMRI scans of pathological gamblers and healthy adults while they were playing a slot machine game. ‘We’ve made our gambling game as lifelike as possible by improving the visuals, adding more sounds and adapting the speed of the slot wheel compared to previous versions. In our game, the chance for a near-miss was 33%, compared to 17% for a win and 50% for a complete-miss.’\\n\\nIntensive study\\n\\nGamblers have a strong illusion of control and they believe in luck more than others when they gamble. ‘It was challenging to find the subjects for this experiment’, according to Sescousse. ‘The prevalence of pathological gambling is relatively low in the Netherlands, and our study was rather intensive. People had to come back to the Donders Institute three times, and they could not have any additional disorders, diseases or drug prescriptions.’\\n\\nWhat is happening in the mind of a gambler when confronted with a near-miss event? Sescousse: ‘In normal situations near-miss events signal the fact that you are learning: this time you didn’t get it quite yet, but keep practicing and you will. Near-misses thus reinforce your behaviour, which happens by triggering activity in reward-related brain regions like the striatum. This also happens when gambling. But slot machines are random, in contrast to everyday life, which makes them such a great challenge to our brain. That’s why these near-misses may create an illusion of control.’\\n\\nSurprise\\n\\nAnimal studies have shown that behavioral responses to near‐miss events are modulated by dopamine, but this dopaminergic influence had not yet been tested in humans. Therefore, all subjects performed the experiment twice: one time after receiving a dopamine blocker, and one time after receiving a placebo. Surprisingly, brain responses to near-miss events were not influenced by this manipulation. ‘For me, this is another confirmation of the complexity of the puzzle that we are working on’, Sescousse explains.\\n\\nThe study was published in Neuropsychopharmacology.',\n",
       " 'I try to explain, as mildly as I can, that my having Jewish friends doesn’t signify the end of the grim state of affairs in the region. I point out that, historically, Arabs and Jews actually lived pretty well together. In spite of rhetoric to the contrary, the Mideast crisis isn’t a case of why-can’t-they-just-get-along. It isn’t about ethnic differences. It isn’t hummus vs. hoummous.\\n\\nSometimes, instead of a pleased-and-patronizing outsider, I find myself confronted with sneaky, lurking, real anti-Semites who unabashedly come out of the woodwork when they hear that I’m Palestinian. “Hey, wanna hear a good one?” a stranger will ask conspiratorially. I cut him off before he finishes his joke, as soon as I can tell where it’s headed. “Dude,” I say. “You have no idea how badly you’ve misread this situation.”\\n\\nIt’s not just that I get how hurtful this type of discrimination can be. As both a Palestinian and an Arab in a post-9/11 world, I’ve been on the receiving end of it. It’s not even just because I can picture the faces of the Jews I know and love, for whom those jokes would strike deep and painfully resonant chords.\\n\\nThere’s another reason I despise these jokes. The Jews I meet might assume that I sympathize with the bomb-wielding extremists who want to push Israel into the sea. (To be clear: I do not.) But these closet anti-Semites assume that I sympathize with a species of historically European anti-Semitism —the kind that involves jokes about Jews hoarding money and controlling the media, the kind that involves big noses and black hats, the kind that led to the Jews’ persecution in the West. And those canards have nothing to do with Palestinians.\\n\\nIn fact, it was this very discrimination and irrational hatred that drove the need for a safe Jewish homeland, after Theodor Herzl anticipated the deadly turn the already-rampant European anti-Semitism would take. It is this continued anti-Semitism that apparently vindicates Israel’s most segregationist policies, invoking fears from centuries of persecution.\\n\\nMoreover, unjustified hatred of the Jewish people reduces any criticism of Israel’s practices to mere bigotry. There are concrete reasons to be at odds with Israel, reasons that include arbitrary arrests, evictions, settlements, and harassment, and simply the fact that most Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem aren’t recognized as voting citizens. Anti-Semitism—whether imported or home-grown—shatters those reasons into splinters of irrational fear.\\n\\nTo lump the Palestinian struggle—for human rights, for recognition, for nationality—in with an age-old prejudice isn’t reductionist; it’s downright absurd. In one fell swoop, a misguided bigot can manage to invoke the very sentiment that forced Jews out of Europe; make me, a Palestinian, part of the same anti-Semitism that led to Israel’s creation; and diminish all legitimate criticism of Israel to a species of European Jew-hating. It would almost be artful, if it weren’t so depressing.',\n",

Image 23 of 23 Should Houston be kept a secret? 1 / 23 Back to Gallery\\n\\n“KEEP HOUSTON SECRET”\\n\\nLike everyone else in Houston, each time I see my city on a new list about how awesome we are, how great our restaurants are, or even how everyone in the country is running over their own grandmother to move here, I get excited. It’s fun to see Houston on any list that doesn’t involve the incredible edible Astros, our humidity, or any number of awful things, like murder, rape, or ungodly traffic.\\n\\n(Speaking of Houston being awesome, these NSFW shirts are becoming ubiquitous inside the Inner Loop, though I doubt I can wear one here at the Chron offices.)\\n\\nAnd my oh my oh is Houston now on tons of lists. It seems some people’s sole enterprise is making lists, either downing or celebrating various American cities. Kinda waiting for a list of cities with the most appearances on lists. Surely Houston will make a good showing.\\n\\nSo far from these lists we know that Houston is really good at moving scams, nurturing business of all sizes, changing business norms, having a healthy housing market, raising rent, creating jobs (lots of manufacturing jobs actually), growing real fast, being mobile-shopping savvy, and generally being “cool” or whatever passes for cool at Forbes magazine. The business mag put us at the top of their cool kids list, and poor ol’ Austin came in at 19 on the Top 20 list. Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Dallas made it on the list at 13, 11, and fourth respectively.\\n\\nForbes used things like our massive number of restaurants (11,196 and climbing), median age (33), and 6.9 percent unemployment rate to get us to the top of the list, though the conspiracy nut in me wants to think it was a week of free meals, hotel rooms at the ZaZa, and a Galleria shopping spree to seal that deal.\\n\\nForbes, not one to spoil a good time, throws a picture of the mock space shuttle we got instead of the real ones that everyone else in the country got to represent us. Bonus points for having the Hilton where Clara Harris ran over her husband in the background of the shot.\\n\\nBuuuurn.\\n\\nHeck, now even The Dallas Morning News is looking down 45 at us in near-approval, though Houstonians will still curse the Big D’s name with impunity at every chance.\\n\\nBut with the praise and accolades, lots of Houstonians are fearful that the Bayou City will become a boomtown cesspool of out-of-towners clogging our roadways, gyms, eateries, apartment complexes, and bars with their non-Texan ways. Pronouncing Houston “how-stun” and Humble like this.\\n\\nThere even seems to be a slight difference of opinion in how to even properly abbreviate Houston, with homers saying that it is and always shall be HOU, and others gunning for HTX, though some snarl that that is too close to Austin’s ATX designation. HTX is for “newstonians” according to the Houstorian Twitter feed, an authority on all things regarding Houston history that isn’t the Chron’s own Bayou City History blog.\\n\\nAnd I won’t even go into all the nicknames that abound. Bayou City, Clutch City, Space City, the Bayou City, H-Town, Screwston, City Of Syrup, The Armpit, and a few others that involve curse words not welcome at a family paper.\\n\\nMany people are wishing that the national media would just shut up about us already, lest we become something that we don’t want to be. But why keep Houston a secret? Why stifle the love?\\n\\n“Easy, just look at Austin, ” says Jay Rascoe, one of Houston’s biggest champions of tacos and beer, with a handful of beer festivals under his belt that he has planned with his wife Cathy. He points to Austin’s expansion into a yuppie resort city, a convention mecca, and generally where dreams go to die painful corporate deaths as reasons why we should keep HOU hid.\\n\\n“If you look at areas like Garden Oaks and the Heights, a lot of old mom-and-pops are closing down and selling their lots for big bucks to developers,” says Rascoe. “Gentrification comes with a price — the loss of a city’s identity and character.”\\n\\nRascoe adds that the creature comforts of the suburbs are entrenching into Houston’s Inner Loop. Plus, it’s not downtown H-Town that is being sold by these lists, it’s really the ‘burbs — because many newbies can’t tell where Houston begins and ends.\\n\\n“I’m not saying these changes are all bad. Crime has dropped big time.” he says. “Fifteen years or so ago, we had to leave our car doors unlocked so burglars wouldn’t bust out your windows to snatch your stereo.”\\n\\nDon’t get the Texican started on bike thefts inside the Loop. I will write a blog on that once my next bicycle gets stolen, which I am sure will happen eventually.\\n\\nMany are amused by those that do not even live in Houston proper — existing on the sidelines — who would try to take credit for the hard work done by Houston’s creative class which in part helped put Houston on the map this past year.\\n\\nLocal musician Craig Kinsey, of eternal Sideshow Tramps fame, is torn on Houston getting a close-up.\\n\\n“Many talented artists, chefs, musicians, dancers, and good business people can profit from the attention,” Kinsey says, before reminding us about the inherent downside to things going above ground.\\n\\n“All that is good will slowly turn lame. Right now we enjoy the rich fruit of a family farm. Bring in national or worldwide attention and you will see the “Monsantofication” of all we partake in here,” Kinsey adds.\\n\\nFood for thought. Delicious, locally-sourced food for thought. With a pint of 8th Wonder on the side.\\n\\nAudio engineer Josh Webster has another take on the new influx of baby Houstonites.\\n\\n“I think people who are willing to leave their homes in another city to move to a strange place with a notorious climate, for more opportunities are the kind of people we should want to be our neighbors,” said Webster.\\n\\nWhat Webster says not only touches on the hearty stock of (most) us Houstonians, but also harkens back to the first Americans who decided to give Texas and Houston itself a chance.\\n\\nAnd then again, both Texas and Houston have a funny way of weeding out invasive species that aren’t fit for these parts.\\n\\nLike Carlos Mencia, trying to open up a Tex-Mex place on our turf without the proper credentials.',\n",
       " 'There have been articles saying Manchester United are a long-ball team and others stating they are not, and even more asking ‘but what is a long ball?’ For us at Opta it is all about the context\\n\\nIf Opta had some sort of early warning system, it would have flashed red on Sunday evening as Sam Allardyce talked about “long-ball United” in his post-game interview. A few minutes later came the first of many inquiries about Louis van Gaal’s style of play, a perfect storm of fact, counterfact and Manchester United. The debate continued on Monday and then surged again on Tuesday as Van Gaal arrived at his press conference with a dossier of passing data, asking the media to “copy it and go to Big Sam”.\\n\\nThe overriding feeling when listening to the debate Allardyce started is one of confusion. It is possible right now to go and read articles saying that Manchester United are a long-ball team, others stating they are not a long-ball team, yet more asking ‘but what is a long ball?’ – plus many people on social media adhering to the time-honoured tradition of saying that the only stat that matters is the one in the top left-hand corner.\\n\\nSurely it should be possible to reach a sensible conclusion. After all, there was only one match between West Ham United and Manchester United on Sunday, only 25 players who featured, only 764 passes and only 143 of those were long. The bare essentials are these: West Ham played 53 long passes against Van Gaal’s team while the visitors made 37 more. So that’s settled, Allardyce was right, United are a long-ball team.\\n\\nBut wait, as the Prozone data Van Gaal used in his dossier on Tuesday showed, West Ham played a higher number of long passes forward (Opta recorded the figures as 45 for the home team, 40 for the visitors) than Manchester United.\\n\\nAnd it’s the pass knocked forward that is the collective image of the so-called long-ball game. You know the scene: cold midweek nights where the ball is hung up speculatively for a big man, while a smaller partner feeds off scraps. West Ham, with 85% of their long passes forward on Sunday, seem to fit that archetype more than United, with their figure of 44%, yet anyone who watched the game will know that most of West Ham’s play throughout the game was incisive and far from the hit-and-hope football of lore.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Louis van Gaal pulls out a stats pamphlet at his press conference.\\n\\nContext is key here, and this is something Opta try to provide, both in how we collect data and what we supply to the outside world. On Monday Danny Higginbotham lamented on Twitter that there is a vast difference between someone like Andrea Pirlo playing a precise long pass and an agricultural launch forward. We agree and separate those two things out. In the Opta world a long pass (35 yards and over if you were wondering) is one aimed to a specific player (think Pirlo), while a long ball is one played into a specific zone (think “hit the channels”).\\n\\nApplying this to the Premier League we see that Van Gaal’s men are second for long passes behind Burnley. That particular ranking has been seen a lot in recent days but Manchester United are still Manchester United and unsurprisingly they make many more passes than Burnley; over 4,000 more heading into the midweek fixtures. A more sensible way of ranking the teams would be to look at the proportion of their passes that are long. This pushes United down to 13th place with a rate of 14%, still higher than the likes of Manchester City (8%), Arsenal (9%), Chelsea and Liverpool (both 11%) but, proportionally, the teams using the long pass are such sides as Crystal Palace, Burnley, QPR, Leicester and, in fifth place, West Ham.\\n\\nEven if we go back to perhaps the last truly vintage Manchester United team, the title winners of 2007-08, we can see that United’s long pass proportion is around 13%, so roughly the same. Now this was seven years ago but it is hard to recall the often devastatingly direct 4-6-0 lineup including Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and Wayne Rooney being singled out for aesthetic criticism.\\n\\nLooking at long balls, United are again 13th in the division this season and perhaps most tellingly they are 15th when it comes to aerial duels in the attacking half. Not the most elegant sounding category but if you play long-ball football you’ll be racking lots of these up every game; Manchester United are not. The passing category that they do top, however, is proportion of passes played sideways, with 56% of their balls heading left or right, and it is this that feels like it gets to the heart of why the team have not been at their best in recent weeks.\\n\\nAs Van Gaal pointed out in his press conference, United’s high possession figures aren’t achieved by playing long-ball football. What the data shows instead is a relative lack of penetration, and sometimes the best remedy for that is to hit it long, as United did in the closing stages of Sunday’s game. The result has been a debate to rival the one almost exactly a year ago when David Moyes’s team hit an astonishing 81 crosses in their home game against Fulham. All we can do is wait and see what February 2016 will bring.\\n\\nDuncan Alexander is head of UK content & media at Opta',\n",

       " 'As recently as 2009, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)—the largest socialist organization in the United States—was described by former member and current New Yorker writer George Packer as “dangerously far along the road to oblivion.”\\n\\nHow quickly things change.\\n\\nIn 2015, an obscure senator from Vermont announced that he would pursue the presidency, and would take on Hillary Clinton, the candidate most considered a lock for the Democratic nomination, in doing so.\\n\\nThis certainty was quickly challenged. Bernie Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist, proved remarkably adept at tapping into grassroots energy, and this energy prompted a flood of organizing and, ultimately, results. Though Hillary Clinton eventually secured the nomination, Sanders ended his presidential run with over 13 million votes and a sizable base of enthusiastic supporters and volunteers looking to move his political revolution forward.\\n\\nSanders’ entrance into the presidential race, and his subsequent use of the term “democratic socialism,” sparked a surge of interest in a group that had long remained on the margins of the American political scene.\\n\\nDSA, founded in 1982, saw its membership begin to trend sharply upward as 2016 progressed. Overall, in the last several months, the organization’s membership has tripled, and the momentum has yet to slow. Its most recent landmark: 20,000 dues-paying members, a goal to which organizers have been looking since the organization reached 10,000 members back in November.\\n\\nAnd with this growth in membership has come increased attention from some of the nation’s largest newspapers and magazines. Rolling Stone ran a profile of DSA in February, as did The Los Angeles Times.\\n\\nDSA also appears to be making all the right enemies.\\n\\n“Socialism’s Rising Popularity Threatens America’s Future,” warned a recent National Review headline.\\n\\nFox News, which has long been hysterically warning of the rising socialist tide, has featured DSA in several recent segments; Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster, insisted last year that the kids are only getting into socialism to get laid; Bill O’Reilly has felt it necessary to “explain” democratic socialism to his audience; and the Conservative Political Action Conference hosted a panel discussion centered on how to convince America’s youth that socialism would rapidly turn the United States into Venezuela.\\n\\nFor long-time organizers, this is all evidence their hard work is beginning to pay off.\\n\\nMore important than disdainful attention from America’s reactionaries is the appeal of DSA among Americans disaffected by the political mainstream and looking for an organized, grassroots group into which they can channel their energy. The Democratic Party has long been the default option, the lesser of two evils, but people are tired of such a narrow spectrum of choices.\\n\\n“Our growth alone shows that people want to be for something, not just against Donald Trump, and they want to have a voice,” wrote DSA’s national director Maria Svart in the latest edition of Democratic Left, the organization’s quarterly publication. “We have an ideological perspective that was missing from mainstream political debate until Bernie Sanders’ primary run, and it’s now on us to carry out a strategy to match.”\\n\\nThis strategy includes building and organizing at the local level in every state, including those that have long been considered solidly and irrevocably conservative, like Texas (which now has ten chapters) and Oklahoma.\\n\\nShortly after Donald Trump’s inauguration, one organizer from Tennessee told me that “a group of unrepresented radicals has been growing underground and is now surging up to lead in areas of the country that the Democrats have long considered sacrifice zones.”\\n\\n“In the future,” he added, “we are hopeful that candidates and campaigns will not feel obliged to toe the Democratic Party line just to have access to some meager organizational resources. We will build our operational capacity to the point that we do not swallow our radicalism to support candidates, but they have to radicalize their positions to win our support.”\\n\\nDSA considers itself a big-tent organization, and it hosts a considerable variety of left perspectives. But at its core, notes Jared Abbott in Democratic Left, is the belief “that capitalism is fundamentally at odds with democracy.”\\n\\nIncreasingly, as recent polls have indicated, Americans, particularly younger Americans, are coming to share this view. And as income and wealth inequality become more pronounced, organizers expect interest in democratic socialism to continue to soar.\\n\\nWith this newfound energy, DSA is hoping to play a significant role in the fights immediately at hand, from helping protect immigrants and refugees to fighting for a health care system that guarantees insurance for all as a right.\\n\\nCrucially, though, these efforts are always informed by long-term objectives; “the surest way to resist and defeat Trumpism,” argued DSA’s post-election statement, “is if we build a strong organized democratic socialist movement in U.S. politics, a movement that must become as diverse as the working class itself.”\\n\\nJake Johnson is a freelance writer.

       " 'Two landmark developments on Aug. 16 give momentum to the growing interest of cities and counties in addressing the mortgage crisis using eminent domain:\\n\\nThe Washington State Supreme Court held in Bain v. MERS, et al., that an electronic database called Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS) is not a \"beneficiary\" entitled to foreclose under a deed of trust; and San Bernardino County, Calif., passed a resolution to consider plans to use eminent domain to address the glut of underwater borrowers by purchasing and refinancing their loans.\\n\\nMERS is the electronic smokescreen that allowed banks to build their securitization Ponzi scheme without worrying about details like ownership and chain of title. According to property law attorney Neil Garfield, properties were sold to multiple investors or conveyed to empty trusts, subprime securities were endorsed as triple A, and banks earned up to 40 times what they could earn on a paying loan, using credit default swaps in which they bet the loan would go into default. As the dust settles from collapse of the scheme, homeowners are left with underwater mortgages with no legitimate owners to negotiate with. The solution now being considered is for municipalities to simply take ownership of the mortgages through eminent domain. This would allow them to clear title and start fresh, along with some other lucrative dividends.\\n\\nA major snag in these proposals has been that to make them economically feasible, the mortgages would have to be purchased at less than fair market value, in violation of eminent domain laws. But for troubled properties with MERS in the title - -which now seems to be the majority of them -- this may no longer be a problem. If MERS is not a beneficiary entitled to foreclose, as held in Bain, it is not entitled to assign that right or to assign title. Title remains with the original note holder; and in the typical case, the note holder can no longer be located or established, since the property has been used as collateral for multiple investors. In these cases, counties or cities may be able to obtain the mortgages free and clear. The county or city would then be in a position to \"do the fair thing,\" settling with stakeholders in proportion to their legitimate claims, and refinancing or reselling the properties, with proceeds accruing to the city or county.\\n\\nBain v. MERS: No Rights Without the Original Note\\n\\nAlthough Bain is binding precedent only in Washington State, it is well reasoned and is expected to be followed elsewhere. The question, said the panel, was \"whether MERS and its associated business partners and institutions can both replace the existing recording system established by Washington statutes and still take advantage of legal procedures established in those same statutes.\" The Court held that they could not have it both ways:\\n\\nSimply put, if MERS does not hold the note, it is not a lawful beneficiary... MERS suggests that, if we find a violation of the act, \"MERS should be required to assign its interest in any deed of trust to the holder of the promissory note, and have that assignment recorded in the land title records, before any non-judicial foreclosure could take place.\" But if MERS is not the beneficiary as contemplated by Washington law, it is unclear what rights, if any, it has to convey. Other courts have rejected similar suggestions. [Citations omitted.]\\n\\nIf MERS has no rights that it can assign, the parties are back to square one: The original holder of the promissory note must be found. The problem is that many of these mortgage companies are no longer in business, and even if they could be located, it is too late in most cases to assign the note to the trusts that are being tossed this hot potato.\\n\\nMortgage-backed securities are sold to investors in packages representing interests in trusts called REMICs (Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits), which are designed as tax shelters. To qualify for that status, however, they must be \"static.\" Mortgages can\\'t be transferred in and out once the closing date has occurred. The REMIC Pooling and Servicing Agreement typically states that any transfer after the closing date is invalid. Yet few, if any, properties in foreclosure seem to have been assigned to these REMICs before the closing date, in blatant disregard of legal requirements.\\n\\nThe whole business is quite complicated, but the bottom line is that title has been clouded not only by MERS but because the trusts purporting to foreclose do not own the properties by the terms of their own documents. Legally, the latter defect may be even more fatal than filing in the name of MERS in establishing a break in the chain of title to securitized properties.\\n\\nWhat This Means for Eminent Domain Plans: Focus on San Bernardino\\n\\nUnder the plans that the San Bernardino County board of supervisors voted to explore, the county would take underwater mortgages by eminent domain and then help the borrowers into mortgages with significantly lower monthly payments.\\n\\nObjections voiced at the Aug. 16 hearing included suspicions concerning the role of Mortgage Resolution Partners, the private venture capital firm bringing the proposal (would it make off with the profits and leave the county footing the bills?), and where the county would get the money for the purchases.\\n\\n\\n\\nA way around these objections might be to eliminate the private middleman and proceed through a county land bank of the sort set up in other states. If the land bank focused on properties with MERS in the chain of title (underwater, foreclosed or abandoned), it might obtain a significant inventory of properties free and clear.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe county would simply need to give notice in the local newspaper of intent to exercise its right of eminent domain. The burden of proof would then transfer to the claimant to establish title in a court proceeding. If the court followed Bain, title typically could not be proved and would pass free and clear to the county land bank, which could sell or rent the property and work out a fair settlement with the parties.\\n\\nThat would resolve not only the funding question but whether using eminent domain to cure mortgage problems constitutes an unconstitutional taking of private property. In these cases, there would be no one to take from, since no one would be able to prove title. The investors would take their place in line as unsecured creditors with claims in equity for actual damages. In most cases, they would be protected by credit default swaps and could recover from those arrangements.\\n\\nThe investors, banks and servicers all profited from the smokescreen of MERS, which shielded them from liability. As noted in Bain:\\n\\nCritics of the MERS system point out that after bundling many loans together, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify the current holder of any particular loan, or to negotiate with that holder... Under the MERS system, questions of authority and accountability arise, and determining who has authority to negotiate loan modifications and who is accountable for misrepresentation and fraud becomes extraordinarily difficult.\\n\\nLike MERS itself, the investors must deal with the consequences of an anonymity so remote that they removed themselves from the chain of title.\\n\\nOn Aug. 15, the Federal Housing Finance Agency threatened to take action against municipalities condemning federal property. But to establish its claim, the FHFA, too, would have to establish that the mortgages were federal property; and under the Bain ruling, this could be difficult.\\n\\nSetting Things Right\\n\\nWhile banks and investors were busy counting their profits behind the curtain of MERS, homeowners and counties have been made to bear the losses. The city of San Bernardino is in such dire straits that on Aug. 1, it filed for bankruptcy.\\n\\nSan Bernardino and other counties are drowning in debt from a crisis created when Wall Street\\'s real estate securitization bubble burst. By using eminent domain, they can clean up the destruction of their land title records and 400 years of real property law. And by setting up their own banks, counties and other municipalities can use their own capital and revenues to generate credit for local purposes.\\n\\nHomeowners who paid much more for a home than it was worth as a result of the securitization bubble have little chance of challenging the legitimacy of their underwater mortgages on their own. Insisting that their state and local governments follow the lead of Washington State and San Bernardino County may be their best shot at escaping debt peonage to their mortgage lenders.',\n",
       " 'It was like going into the belly of the beast.\\n\\nThis week in Washington is the annual “policy summit” of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a powerful, secretive organization funded by the Koch brothers and other corporate interests that is famous for drafting conservative legislation that Republican state legislatures adopt down to the last semicolon. And the news media were invited to attend!\\n\\nI descended the escalators at the Grand Hyatt downtown, two floors below street level, excited by the possibilities listed on the ALEC agenda:\\n\\nThe environment and energy task force, led by private-sector American Electric Power. The tax and fiscal policy task force, headed by Altria. The international relations task force, run by Philip Morris. The commerce and insurance task force, by State Farm. And the health and human services task force, by Guarantee Trust Life Insurance.\\n\\nAlas, I was quickly regurgitated from the belly of the beast. Outside the meeting rooms, a D.C. police officer, stationed to keep out the riffraff, turned me away.\\n\\n“Our business meetings are not open, and so the subcommittee meetings and task force meetings are not open,” explained Bill Meierling, an ALEC spokesman. I could wait a few hours and then attend a luncheon and some workshops, as long as I promised not to record them.\\n\\nBut Meierling wanted to assure me that there was nothing untoward about this arrangement, and that it was absolutely not true that the corporations that fund ALEC were behind closed doors, handing their legislative wish lists to the conservative state legislators who then pass them, rubber-stamp style, from coast to coast.\\n\\n“What you fundamentally need to know about this organization is it’s completely legislator driven,” he said.\\n\\nUh-huh. And ALEC is proving that by keeping reporters from the rooms where the legislators are or are not receiving their marching orders from corporate patrons.\\n\\nThis probably won’t fly much longer. ALEC has been a major force behind the conservative swing in state capitals, and it claims 82 alumni in the House — including Speaker John Boehner (Ohio) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Va.) — and 11 in the Senate. Its advisory council includes Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, Diageo, AT&T, Peabody Energy, Koch Industries and UPS, and exhibitors at its conference this week include the Charles Koch Institute, the Family Research Council and the Heritage Foundation. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) are addressing the conference.\\n\\nBut ALEC’s fortunes began to change with the killing of Trayvon Martin and the resulting attention to the danger of “stand your ground” laws, one of many initiatives ALEC spread from sea to shining sea. Some corporate sponsors, including Amazon, Coca-Cola, General Electric, Kraft, McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, quit ALEC. On Tuesday, the Guardian newspaper published a trove of internal ALEC documents showing how grim its situation has become.\\n\\nIt reported that the group has lost almost 400 state legislators in the past two years and more than 60 corporations. Its income fell a third short of projections in the first six months of this year. To raise money, the documents showed, ALEC considered expanding its policy portfolio to gambling, and, concerned about potential tax problems with its designation as a 501(c)(3) charity, it is considering 501(c)(4) status, which would allow it to lobby more openly.\\n\\nAmong the ALEC documents obtained by the Guardian: a draft loyalty oath for legislators who serve as the group’s state chairs, declaring that “I will act with care and loyalty and put the interests of the organization first.”\\n\\nWhen I first dealt with ALEC as a state government reporter 18 years ago, it was right of center but known for thoughtful policy research. But it adopted an aggressive agenda to pass legislation expanding gun rights and voter-identification requirements, and limit the reach of public-employee unions, social-welfare programs, consumer and environmental protections, and Obamacare.\\n\\nEmboldened by the Guardian report, liberal politicians held an anti-ALEC teleconference Wednesday afternoon. “ALEC,” said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), a former member of the group, “is nothing more than a corporate-funded and\\n\\n-dominated group that operates much like a dating service, only between legislators and special interests.”\\n\\nDanielle Conrad, a Nebraska state senator who quit ALEC, called it a “shadowy group” that made a “radical shift” in its agenda.\\n\\nAt the Grand Hyatt, Meierling, who joined ALEC from the United Way in January, told me that he’s gradually introducing transparency but that ALEC “can’t just kick the doors open.”\\n\\nActually, it can — unless it doesn’t want people to see what’s behind those doors.\\n\\nTwitter: @Milbank\\n\\nRead more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.',\n",

       " \"Scarborough needs light rapid transit, UTSC experts say\\n\\nOpening day in March, 1985 for the Scarborough RT train. A new report on transit options by U of T Scarborough Professor André Sorensen shows LRT along major east-west arterial roads make the most sense given Scarborough’s urban makeup. (photo by Robert Taylor via Flickr)\\n\\nLRT along major east-west arterial roads make the most sense for Scarborough’s urban makeup, according to a new report on rapid transit options from the University of Toronto.\\n\\n“A critical aspect that’s been neglected in recent debates on transit investments in Scarborough is the potential for land redevelopment and intensification in areas near proposed transit stations,” said U of T Scarborough ProfessorAndré Sorensen, who authored the 42-page report along with U of T Associate Professor Paul Hess.\\n\\n(Read the report: Choices for Scarborough: Transit, Walking and Intensification in Toronto's Inner Suburbs.)\\n\\nThe pair mapped land use, street networks, pedestrian access to transit stops and development potential in the corridors that could be served by the different rapid transit options under consideration for Scarborough. They suggest that building a high-capacity rapid transit line in low-intensity suburban areas only makes sense if it’s possible to redevelop and intensify lands within walking distance of the transit stops.\\n\\n“The best opportunities for redevelopment exist along Scarborough’s east-west arterials, such as Eglinton and Sheppard, because they have large lots, wide property frontages and currently have low intensity of land use,” said Sorensen, an urban geographer known for his studies of urban regeneration in cities such as Tokyo.\\n\\nToronto’s suburbs were originally designed to resist gradual change in residential areas, notes Sorensen. There are rules against intensification and, even today, suggestions of redevelopment are often met with strong opposition from residents. As a result, few areas provide opportunities for significant redevelopment.\\n\\nSorensen and Hess conclude that LRT lines such as those proposed by Transit City are not only cheaper and faster to build than a subway, they also offer greater potential for spurring much-needed reinvestment in the area.\\n\\nBy comparison the city council’s plan to build the Scarborough subway extension from Kennedy to Sheppard Avenue would be expensive, accessible to far fewer potential riders from the surrounding neighbourhoods and offer much lower potential for redevelopment along the corridor.\\n\\n“LRT offers a longer set of lines and is a much better fit with the existing landscape in Scarborough, including both where the population is and where the jobs are today and where they will likely grow in the future through redevelopment and intensification,” said Sorensen\\n\\nThe report also says rapid transit planning has become intensely political, focusing too narrowly on routes, ridership capacity and the projected cost of various lines while neglecting important elements of how areas such as Scarborough were developed, which “sets the stage” for development and transit opportunities.\\n\\n“Understandably there is considerable pressure to just start building something, but it’s more important to get these decisions right,” said Hess. “These investments will cost billions of dollars and will profoundly shape the future of urban development and potentially improve the quality of life for many who live in this area of the city.”\\n\\nThe top priority for Scarborough transit should be the Sheppard LRT, say Sorensen and Hess, who stress that it should begin construction right away.\\n\\n“The Sheppard LRT outperforms all of the potential lines in terms of the number of residents, jobs and pedestrian network per kilometre of track,” said Hess. “It’s already been approved with environmental assessments and would be able to start carrying passengers even before construction starts on either of the two existing proposals.”\",\n",
       " 'As I mentioned yesterday, Hollywood does not like it when Halloween falls on a Friday. The new films have smaller Fridays but larger multipliers, while holdover films get murdered on Fridays only to double their Friday numbers on Saturday. There were only two new wide releases this weekend, plus a timely reissue. So it\\'s no surprise that the top new film of the frame is Nightcrawler, with $10.7 million for the Halloween frame, just below the $10.7m second weekend of Ouija. Obviously the numbers could change when final figures are released tomorrow, but for the moment let\\'s ignore the ranking thing.\\n\\nThe Jake Gyllenhaal thriller capitalized on superb reviews (it\\'s one of the best films of the year, hands-down) and a vaguely \"scary\" marketing campaign from Open Road Films to hold its own against Ouija as the de-facto Halloween movie of choice for the weekend. The picture cost just $8.5m to produce which means it\\'s well on its way to being profitable. Gyllenhaal is generally good for around $10-14m on an opening in a lower-profile film like this (think End of Watch or Source Code), so this is right in his wheelhouse. Had it pulled in the same $10.4 million opening weekend next weekend, it would have been eclipsed by Big Hero 6 and Interstellar. But this weekend it is the so-called top film, and Open Road Films deserves credit for cannily scheduling a somewhat unconventional thriller in a weekend where it wouldn\\'t face much competition and it had the slightest tinge of being seasonally-appropriate. Of note, Jake Gyllenhaal is becoming something of a George Clooney, using his star power to make smaller, artistically interesting films that don\\'t necessarily require blockbuster debuts to break even.\\n\\nThe other semi-wide new release was the Nicole Kidman/Colin Firth thriller Before I Go to Sleep. The film opened with next-to-no buzz and few pre-release reviews, so the fact that it opened over the weekend with $2.03 million this weekend is not a surprise. It’s another blockbuster debut from the new distributor that gave us And So It Goes ($4.6m) and Legends of Oz: Dorothy\\'s Return ($3.7m). As of now, the distributor doesn\\'t seem to have anything on its future slate, so the short life of the distributor may be one of those weird box office stories of 2014. Although to be fair, even Summit Entertainment had to deal with a learning curve with the likes of P2 ($2m debut for a really great thriller by the way) and Sex Drive ($3.6m for an okay sex comedy with a fun James Marsden turn) before it had Twilight and Red. As for Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth, Mr. Firth was never a box office draw while Kidman has long gone out of her way to pick projects that don\\'t necessarily scream \"box office smash.\"\\n\\nThe only other major new release was the 10th anniversary theatrical reissue of Lionsgate\\'s Saw. The \"house that Jigsaw built\" celebrated the anniversary by dropping the film into 2,000 screens for this week only, but audiences didn\\'t seem to care. The film made just $650,000 over the weekend. If the idea was to gauge interest in a reboot or continuation four years after the fact, I guess it’s “game over.\" As a fan, I\\'m glad. Saw was a defining franchise, but I don\\'t need to see another property extended well-beyond its natural shelf life and/or revived purely because it\\'s a known entity. Besides, the last installment, four Halloweens ago, was the series low-point, so I\\'d rather just pretend the series ended at Saw VI. Daniel Radcliffe\\'s Horns has been on VOD for awhile and has already earned $1m from the pre-theatrical release, so A24 isn\\'t too busted up about its $104k in 103 theaters theatrical debut. It\\'s also a terrible movie, so there is that too.\\n\\nIn holdover news, Universal\\'s ( Comcast Corp.) Ouija earned $10.7 million to top the box office for the second weekend in a row. The horror film of the season, by default, dropped 43% from last weekend, which is a shockingly good hold for a horror film that inspired no buzz and no love. Universal\\'s positioning of the picture the weekend before Halloween weekend was a smart one, and the film was helped quite a bit by the holiday. The $5m cheapie now sits with $34.8m in ten days. I actually saw it last night at the wife\\'s request. It\\'s not remotely good, but it\\'s somewhat more watchable than Annabelle for whatever that\\'s worth. Lionsgate\\'s John Wick recovered from its Friday night dive, doubling its numbers on Saturday and ending the frame with a mere 44% drop. The Keanu Reeves vehicle earned $8.05m over its second frame and has now earned $27.5m domestic. I\\'d like to think the film will have legs even as the holiday onslaught begins, but at least John Wick will not go quietly into that good night.\\n\\nSt. Vincent earned a stunning $7.75 million on its second weekend of wide release, actually increasing 0.001% from last weekend. The Bill Murray/Melissa McCarthy comedy is proving to be a true crowd-pleaser and has now earned $19.53m domestic. I saw the film yesterday, and while it could have been written in a quirkie indie comedy Mad Libs book, it works and it\\'s a pure audience pleaser. I don\\'t know how serious the film is as an Oscar contender, but if it plays all season and ends up doing far outgrossing the likes of Whiplash and Birdman along with this month\\'s The Theory of Everything, The Imitation Game, and Foxcatcher, it may be a bigger player than initially presumed. Guardians of the Galaxy has earned $765.1m worldwide to become the year\\'s second-biggest global blockbuster after the $1b+ Transformers: Age of Extinction. It has earned $94.3m in China alone.\\n\\nWarner Bros.\\'( Time Warner Inc.) The Judge earned $3.4 million (-22%), bringing the Robert Downey Jr. vehicle\\'s current total to $39.5m. Annabelle earned another $2m (-40%) on its last remotely viable weekend to bring its cume to $82.5m. Dracula Untold crossed $50m domestic on Friday and now sits with around $52.8m domestic after earning $2.94m (-33%) over the Halloween weekend. Brad Pitt\\'s Fury earned $9.1m on its third weekend. The Sony release has somewhat quietly earned a solid $60.4m in 17 days and may-yet find itself in the Oscar race if the December front-runners (Inherent Vice, American Sniper, Unbroken) don\\'t click. Addicted earned $675k over the weekend for a new $16.4m domestic total. Book of Life earned $8.3m on its third weekend, down just 17% as Day of the Dead fell on Saturday, to bring its total to $40.5m. Hopefully this one can survive Big Hero 6 next weekend.\\n\\nWalt Disney\\'s Alexander and the Horrible Terrible No-Good Very Bad Day dropped just 10% over the frame, earning $6.4m and bringing its cume to $53.6m. Gone Girl surpassed the $127 million gross of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button on Thursday to become director David Fincher\\'s biggest grosser in America. The film is holding strong and earned $8.8m this weekend to bring its cume to $136.6m. What I said about Oscars and Fury goes double for Gone Girl, as I\\'m half-inclined to predict a Best Picture win at this stage if the half-dozen or so November/December contenders don\\'t break through beyond acting/writing recognition accordingly. The Equalizer earned $1.8m over the weekend resulting in a $96.5m cume for the Denzel Washington vehicle. Finally Birdman expanded to 231 theaters and Fox Searchlight\\'s would-be Oscar champ earned $2.51m ($11k per screen) and brought its domestic cume to $5m.\\n\\nThat\\'s it for this week. Join us next weekend for the start of the holiday season, as Chris Nolan\\'s Interstellar (opening on Tuesday night in select locations) and Walt Disney\\'s Big Hero 6 kick off the holiday season (see reviews for both on the left sidebar). Also, the Stephen Hakwing biopic The The Theory of Everything (which I have shamefully procrastinated in terms of writing a review for) opens in limited release on Friday.

Maloney, who is gay, ousted Hayworth from the seat in 2012.\\n\\nThe Human Rights Campaign, the nation\\'s largest organization advocating for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, was unimpressed with Hayworth\\'s new ad. In a statement, the group criticized Hayworth for her policy positions, saying that just because she has a gay son doesn\\'t mean she\\'s a champion of LGBT rights.\\n\\n\"Of course Nan Hayworth loves her gay son. That\\'s not what\\'s at issue here,\" said David Stacy, HRC\\'s government affairs director. \"The problem is her lack of support for legal protections provided by marriage for everyone else who isn\\'t lucky enough to be related to an elected official. When Nan Hayworth had the chance to be a true fighter for LGBT issues in Congress, she was AWOL.\"\\n\\nHRC added that while in office, Hayworth refused to support marriage equality when the group asked her to do so. She also did not sign on to legislation that would have repealed the federal ban on same-sex marriage, and did not back a bill that would have extended the immigration benefits that heterosexual couples receive to same-sex partners of U.S. citizens.\\n\\nBut she did earn praise from LGBT groups for signing on as a cosponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would bar workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. She also was one of the lawmakers who introduced the Tax Parity for Health Plan Beneficiaries Act to end the taxation of employer-provided health insurance for domestic partners. At the time, HRC put out a press release praising her bill.\\n\\nHayworth and Maloney recently met with the Poukeepsie Journal\\'s editorial board, and the issue of marriage equality came up. Hayworth said she supported the Supreme Court\\'s ruling this month that left in place lower court decisions legalizing same-sex marriage in a number of states. But she added that the \"federal government should not impose a definition\" of marriage, indicating that she still opposes marriage equality at the federal level.\\n\\nHayworth also said, however, that states should recognize same-sex marriages performed legally elsewhere.\\n\\n\"If you get married in one state, it should be honored in every other state,\" she said.\\n\\nMaloney responded that Hayworth was in favor of allowing states to deprive him and his husband of their rights.\\n\\n\"She supports the ability of states that now discriminate to continue to do so,\" he replied.\\n\\nIn the 112th Congress, Hayworth had a 71 percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign.

The slump is expected to continue in 2013 when the government is set to take budget cuts and tax increases worth 9.4 billion euros as a pre-condition to receive more funds under its international bailout.\\n\\nRelated Coverage Greek construction slump drags on in August\\n\\nA record 1.27 million Greeks were without work in August, up 38 percent from the same month last year.\\n\\nGreece’s August jobless rate was the European Union’s second highest, behind fellow euro zone sufferer Spain, whose unemployment rate stood at 25.5 percent, according to Eurostat.\\n\\nThe European Commission forecast this week that the Greek labor market would bottom out in 2013, with unemployment slipping to around 22 percent in 2014, the economy’s first year of modest recovery after six consecutive years of recession.\",\n",
       " 'Recently, he gave voice to the question himself. It was last Thursday at 8:30 a.m. and Emmanuel Macron, dressed in a teal suit coat and navy blue tie, found himself at a podium in the Grand Palais in Paris. \"Why am I actually a Socialist?\" he asked his audience.\\n\\nFor a former investment banker who was recently assigned with the unenviable task of reforming his country as economics minister, it is an excellent question.\\n\\nMacron\\'s audience last Thursday morning was made up of perhaps 70 business leaders in an event organized by an economics magazine. Most of them were just as elegantly dressed as Macron himself, and they chuckled with amusement at his question.\\n\\nBut instead of answering his own question, the minister for economics, industry and information technology unfurled his far-reaching vision for a reinvigorated France. He spoke of the common welfare, which needed to once again take precedence over individual interests. And he underscored his exposition with a quote from the Socialist reformer Jean Jaurès from the year 1887.\\n\\nIt is the French way, a method of situating one\\'s self in the grand arch of history. And it suits Macron well.\\n\\nFrance must change, he said last Thursday from the podium in the vast palace on the Champs-Élysées, and it wasn\\'t the first time he had uttered the sentiment. The country isn\\'t doing well, he continued. \"Those who say we can continue on like this for another 10 years are lying.\" Macron\\'s tone was far from shrill. Rather, he spoke calmly, almost quietly.\\n\\nEmmanuel Macron has been France\\'s economics minister for three-and-a-half months now and, at 36 years, he is the youngest member of Hollande\\'s cabinet. Since he was appointed to renew the country, he has been called everything from a \"high-flyer,\" to a \"beacon of hope\" to a \"careerist.\" The magazine Marianne recently even referred to him as a \"wolf in sheep\\'s clothing.\" There are some within François Hollande\\'s inner circle who say he is the president\\'s \"last wildcard.\"\\n\\nSymbolic Break\\n\\nBack in March, Hollande heralded a political about-face by naming the conservative Social Democrat Manuel Valls as prime minister. Macron\\'s appointment was a further symbolic break from the president\\'s disappointing first two years in office.\\n\\nMacron\\'s predecessor at the Economics Ministry, Arnaud Montebourg, was a convinced Colbertist, an approach which calls for significant state control over the economy. Many in France still see it as the only valid model.\\n\\nBut Macron intends to push through far-reaching economic reforms of the kind that have thus far been largely shunned. There is much riding on his success and on whether Hollande and his party give him a free hand. The central question is whether France can find the strength to free itself of its current plight.\\n\\nThis week will go a long way toward determining whether it can. On Wednesday, Macron will be presenting his first significant draft law to the cabinet in Paris, the so-called \"Loi Macron,\" including 107 different measures. The party\\'s left wing has already said it will oppose the package.\\n\\nThe law, says Socialist lawmaker Jean-Jacques Urvoas, contains 107 \"fragmentation bombs,\" while former Environment Minister Delphine Batho would not exclude the possibility of what she termed a \"parliamentary accident.\" Many Socialists do not completely trust Macron because of the four years he worked as an investment banker with Rothschild. They see him as a handmaiden for high finance and as a careerist. \"He probably doesn\\'t even know how to get to party headquarters,\" one Socialist party member spat when President Hollande announced his appointment at the end of August.\\n\\nIndeed, the criticism of Macron and his signature draft law makes it look for the moment as though the government may not get the support it needs when the package comes up for a vote in parliament, currently scheduled for January. Its failure would be the final proof that significant change is not compatible with the Hollande era.\\n\\n\\'Responsibility Pact\\'\\n\\nMacron is hoping to open up his country\\'s overregulated, static labor market. One element of his plan, for example, calls for the elimination of legal protections which grant monopoly-like powers to dozens of professions. Notaries, pharmacists and bus and taxi drivers would all be affected. Furthermore, he would like to allow shops to open on 12 Sundays per year instead of the current five and introduce \\x8040 billion worth of tax and withholding relief to French companies over the next three years to help them on the road to increased competitiveness. A reduction of high non-wage labor costs, which play a role in the country\\'s high rate of unemployment, is also part of the plan, at least for the low-wage sector.\\n\\nAll of these measures are part of the so-called \"responsibility pact\" introduced by Hollande at the beginning of the year, part of the president\\'s attempt to make France more business friendly. The reforms are to be accompanied by spending cuts worth \\x8050 billion by 2017. But in France, special interest groups remain powerful, meaning that negotiations over several elements of the pact have made little progress.\\n\\nA Friday morning in November found Emmanuel Macron on his leather couch in his office, a basket of fruit from the supermarket Regis on the table in front of him. A bouquet of tulips adorned the shelf behind him. His office is in a glass and steel building on the banks of the Seine, one of the many ministries in the Paris quarter of Bercy. Together, they clearly convey the French view of the state\\'s role in the economy.\\n\\nMacron -- dapper and handsome with his perfectly parted hair and boyish face -- is relaxed as he lounges on his sofa. He possesses a perfect resume, of the kind that could lead one to suspect arrogance were he not so polite. Indeed, his CV explains much of the envy and resentment people have for him -- but also the immense hopes that have been placed on his shoulders.\\n\\n\"If being a politician means wanting to be re-elected at any price, then I\\'m not one,\" he says. The fact that he has never been elected to political office, he says, gives him the necessary freedom to fight for his convictions. On his desk stands a model of the Ariane 5 rocket next to stacks of colored file folders. If there is a picture of his family, it is well hidden.\\n\\nSince 2007, Macron has been married to his former French teacher, Brigitte Trogneux, who is 20 years his senior. He was just 17 when they met at the Catholic school he went to in Amiens, north of Paris. The gossip magazine Closer, which has preferred in the past to focus on Hollande\\'s liaison with the actress Julie Gayet, recently published a photo series of Macron and Trogneux. It showed the two taking a weekend stroll through Montmartre, he in jeans and white shirt and she, a peroxide blonde wearing dark sunglasses. They make for an unconventional couple, and not just in France.\\n\\n\\'You Can\\'t Pick the Moment\\'\\n\\nOn this November morning, Macron speaks openly about the failures of recent French governments, including his own, and their preference for blaming others for not introducing badly needed reforms. He is particularly critical of what he calls \"misguided Marxism,\" a clear reference to the majority of his own party.\\n\\nHe is fully aware of the resistance he is facing. Though he often demands rhetorical clarity, the frequency with which he escapes into vocal contortions has increased. When asked, for example, about the 35-hour work week -- sacred to many Socialists -- he says: \"I defend it, but I don\\'t place it on a pedestal.\" He would like to see \"more flexibility,\" he says. It makes it sound like he would like to do away with it, but doesn\\'t have the power at present -- a realistic assessment.\\n\\nWhen asked if he is bothered by the fact that his first ministerial post has come under a struggling President Hollande, he responds coolly: \"You can\\'t pick the moment in which you take on responsibility.\" It is sentences such as these that lay bare his elite school education and the rhetorical aloofness that comes along with it. He is adept at finding an appropriate reply to any query within just a few seconds.\\n\\nIn France\\'s political class, Macron\\'s elite education -- he graduated from Sciences Po and Ena -- is hardly an exception, of course. Prior to moving on to the Ècole Nationale d\\'Administration, attended by many top French politicians, including Hollande, Macron obtained a master\\'s degree in philosophy, writing his thesis on Machiavelli. For two years, he also worked as the assistant to well-known philosopher Paul Ricoeur. Together, the two wrote essays on history and memory for the philosophy periodical Esprit, where Macron is still listed as a contributing author, though his last article for the publication appeared in 2011, after he had already begun working as an investment banker. His business career also included a stint as an advisor for customers such as Nestlé.\\n\\nHollande and Macron met several years ago at a dinner hosted by Jacques Attali, a former advisor to François Mitterrand, who has great respect for Macron. It is possible the two hit it off so well because Macron, like Hollande himself, is the consummate technocrat.\\n\\nBefore Macron became minister, he was Hollande\\'s economic advisor, first during the campaign and then in the Elysée. His views were sought out and valued, but very few of them actually found their way into governmental policy. Macron, for example, was particularly critical of Holland\\'s 75 percent tax on incomes over \\x801 million, saying it made France a \"Cuba without sun.\" The tax was implemented anyway.\\n\\n\\'Time Is Too Short\\'\\n\\nIn the Elysée, he was called Mozart because of his piano-playing abilities, which are advanced enough that he likely could have become a professional pianist. But he always wanted to go into politics, say long-time acquaintances. He got plenty of help along the way from well-known political personalities, most of them older men and not all of them from the leftist camp.\\n\\nAlain Minc, a former advisor to President Nicolas Sarkozy, is one of them. He has known Macron for more than 10 years, calls him \"my chick,\" and says Macron is an \"extremely able minister.\\n\\nNevertheless, he doubts whether he will achieve much. \"In the two-and-a-half years remaining in Hollande\\'s presidency, it won\\'t be possible to push through large reforms. The time is too short,\" he says, adding that Macron won\\'t get the support he needs from the Socialist-controlled parliament. Minc says that Macron and Valls are alone with their desire for an economic renewal and that when the economy minister presents his plans to lawmakers in January, the battle against them will begin in earnest. Macron, Minc believes, is a \"great talent\" damned to be forced to wait for better times.\\n\\nThe wait might be long. The French economy has shown no growth in the last three years with unemployment, currently at almost 11 percent, rising during the same period. Hollande\\'s inconsistency is partially to blame. He has taken steps forward, but they have often been followed by steps backward, a back-and-forth that has consumed much of his five-year term in a presidency that is the least popular France has seen in some time. What does he really want? Despite the appointments of Valls and Macron, it is a question that still can\\'t be answered.\\n\\nThe prime minister, the economics minister and the president agree on one thing, though: They are opposed to biting austerity measures, fearing they might plunge France even deeper into recession. Indeed, Paris only plans to bring France\\'s budget deficit in line with the EU maximum -- of 3 percent of gross domestic product -- in 2017. The European Commission has admonished the Hollande administration while German Chancellor Angela Merkel has desperately tried to get her flagging neighbor to change course. But to no avail.\\n\\nA Meaningless Gesture\\n\\nIndeed, France has recently found powerful allies for its dawdling in Berlin. In late November, a report called \"Reform, Investment and Growth: An Agenda for France, Germany and Europe,\" was released by the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. The study had been jointly commissioned by Macron and his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel, but the two immediately rejected its core demands, a move which essentially degraded the report to a meaningless gesture.\\n\\nBack in his office, Macron furrows his brow and says he is well aware that his country has a credibility problem following all of the empty promises. \"Instead of talking, we have to finally act,\" he says.\\n\\nThe problem is, though, that the French government hasn\\'t just lost credibility abroad. Many in France have lost their faith in the state and in the political classes. Indeed, the crisis of confidence may even be more damaging to the country than its economic problems, and it is the reason that right-wing populist Marine Le Pen\\'s Front National has found such success of late. Current surveys indicate that she would beat Hollande in the first round of presidential elections were they held now, yet another indication that traditional political parties have fallen into disrepute.\\n\\nIt is perhaps no surprise, then, that Macron is confronted by skepticism from all sides. His approval rating of 35 percent may make him one of the most popular members of Hollande\\'s current cabinet. But he is also one of its most unusual: a young man who is more Social Democrat than Socialist.\\n\\nStill, as the product of elite schools, he also embodies a type of politician that has long dominated French politics. Many such technocrats walk the halls of French ministries and of the Elysée -- and they are part of the increasing estrangement between the French and their politicians. Indeed, one of Macron\\'s most telling missteps came when speaking in a radio interview about female workers at a factory that was threatened with closure. He said that these women \"could neither write nor read.\"\\n\\nIt was a blunder that confirmed the image many had of him as someone with no understanding of grassroots Socialist voters. One newspaper called him an \"elite sweetie,\" a moniker clearly intended as an insult. But in France, a country which has a long tradition of developing its elite, such insults are sanctimonious at best. Macron is but one of many functionaries in the upper echelons of business or politics who can easily move from one important position to another.\\n\\nWhen he took office, Macron said that he would resign from his post as economy minister were he unable to push through policies he was convinced of. Either way, his future is secure.',\n",

       " 'BHOPAL: Dead trail in MPPEB scam continues as TOI tracks more students who died mysteriously after being booked by the special task force investigating the scam. Final year medical student Lalit Kumar Golaria, 28, was found dead under a bridge in Morena district on January 16 this year.He was a key link in the inter-state gang involved in pumping proxies for medical entrance examinations across India. Whistle-blowers Anand Rai and Ashish Chaturvedi have demanded separate probes into the deaths.While police shut investigations into his death, calling it suicide due to depression, family members said Lalit lived in fear. “We don’t know if he jumped off the bridge or was pushed by someone. He was worried about something, which he never discussed with us,” a family member told TOI. Lalit’s parents received an call for money from him, just two hours before police called them to inform about his death.Lalit was booked in MPPEB scam by special investigation team (SIT) of Gwalior police on January 13, 2014. He was was then in his final year MBBS course at Gajra Raja Medical College (GRMC), Gwalior.In 2013, GRMC committee listed him among 19 students who they said used unfair means to clear examinations. All of them were sacked in 2014 and their cases forwarded to Gwalior SIT for further probe. Lalit was arrested and then released on bail on January 4, this year, said sources.On January 15, Morena police called his family to inform that he had committed suicide and has left behind a note, requesting donation of his body to the medical college for anatomy study.“He came to the bridge on Saakh river in Morena on a bike, left a suicide note and jumped into the river,” sub-inspector of Noorabad police station K Khan told TOI. He also wrote in his suicide note that none should be blamed for his death. Lalit was survived by his wife and five-year-old son.Khan, however, could not come clear if he came across eyewitnesses to bolster the suicide theory. Lalit, had in his note, apologised to his wife and son for taking the extreme step and asked brothers to take care of them, said police. His father was employed with office of accountant general (AG) and died recently.After initial investigations, police said he was reeling under depression after his name surfaced in the scam. He had called his brother a week before his death and demanded Rs 8000. “He also asked for Rs 3000, a few hours before he committed suicide,” said police. Due to his death, SIT could not proceed investigations against the recruitment syndicate which facilitated him with an impersonator in PMT, 2006.',\n",

       " '\"Lúnasa\" redirects here. For other uses, see Lúnasa (disambiguation)\\n\\nLughnasadh or Lughnasa ( LOO-nə-sə) is a Gaelic festival marking the beginning of the harvest season. Historically, it was widely observed throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man. In Modern Irish it is called Lúnasa, in Scottish Gaelic: Lùnastal, and in Manx: Luanistyn. Traditionally it is held on 1 August, or about halfway between the summer solstice and autumn equinox. However, in recent centuries some of the celebrations shifted to the Sundays nearest this date. Lughnasadh is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals, along with Samhain, Imbolc and Beltane. It corresponds to other European harvest festivals such as the Welsh Gŵyl Awst and the English Lammas.\\n\\nLughnasadh is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and has pagan origins. The festival itself is named after the god Lugh. It involved great gatherings that included religious ceremonies, ritual athletic contests (most notably the Tailteann Games), feasting, matchmaking and trading. There were also visits to holy wells. According to folklorist Máire MacNeill, evidence shows that the religious rites included an offering of the \\'first fruits\\', a feast of the new food and of bilberries, the sacrifice of a bull and a ritual dance-play in which Lugh seizes the harvest for mankind and defeats the powers of blight. Much of the activities would have taken place on top of hills and mountains.\\n\\nLughnasadh customs persisted widely until the 20th century, with the event being variously named \\'Garland Sunday\\', \\'Bilberry Sunday\\', \\'Mountain Sunday\\' and \\'Crom Dubh Sunday\\'. The custom of climbing hills and mountains at Lughnasadh has survived in some areas, although it has been re-cast as a Christian pilgrimage. The best known is the \\'Reek Sunday\\' pilgrimage to the top of Croagh Patrick on the last Sunday in July. A number of fairs are also believed to be survivals of Lughnasadh, for example the Puck Fair. Since the late 20th century, Celtic neopagans have observed Lughnasadh, or something based on it, as a religious holiday. In some places, elements of the festival have been revived as a cultural event.\\n\\nA modern Lughnasadh corn dolly representing the god Lugh\\n\\nName [ edit ]\\n\\nIn Old Irish (or Old Gaelic), the name was Lugnasad ( IPA: [ˈlˠʊɣnˠəsˠəd̪ˠ]). This is a combination of Lug (the god Lugh) and násad (an assembly), which is unstressed when used as a suffix.[1] Later spellings include Luᵹ̇nasaḋ, Lughnasadh and Lughnasa.\\n\\nIn Modern Irish (Gaeilge), the spelling is Lúnasa [ˈl̪ˠuːn̪ˠəsˠə], which is also the name for the month of August. The genitive case is also Lúnasa as in Mí Lúnasa (Month of August)[1] and Lá Lúnasa (Day of Lúnasa).[2][3] In Modern Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig), the festival and the month are both called Lùnastal [ˈl̪ˠuːnəs̪t̪əl̪ˠ].[4] In Manx (Gaelg), the festival and the month are both called Luanistyn [ˈluanɪstθən]. The day itself may be called either Laa Luanistyn or Laa Luanys.[5]\\n\\nIn Welsh (Cymraeg), the day is known as Calan Awst, originally a Latin term,[6] the Calends of August in English.[1] In Breton (brezhoneg), the day was known as Gouel Eost,[7] the Feast of August.\\n\\nHistoric Lughnasadh customs [ edit ]\\n\\nAn altar depicting a three-faced god identified as Lugh/Lugus\\n\\nIn Irish mythology, the Lughnasadh festival is said to have begun by the god Lugh (modern spelling: Lú) as a funeral feast and athletic competition (see funeral games) in commemoration of his mother or foster-mother Tailtiu.[8] She was said to have died of exhaustion after clearing the plains of Ireland for agriculture.[8] Tailtiu may have been an earth goddess who represented the dying vegetation that fed mankind.[9] The funeral games in her honour were called the Óenach Tailten or Áenach Tailten (modern spelling: Aonach Tailteann) and were held each Lughnasadh at Tailtin in what is now County Meath. According to medieval writings, kings attended this óenach and a truce was declared for its duration. It was similar to the Ancient Olympic Games and included ritual athletic and sporting contests, horse racing, music and storytelling, trading, proclaiming laws and settling legal disputes, drawing-up contracts, and matchmaking.[8][10][11] At Tailtin, trial marriages were conducted, whereby young couples joined hands through a hole in a wooden door.[12] The trial marriage lasted a year and a day, at which time the marriage could be made permanent or broken without consequences.[8][13][14][15][16][17] A similar Lughnasadh festival, the Óenach Carmain, was held in what is now County Kildare. Carman is also believed to have been a goddess, perhaps one with a similar tale as Tailtiu.[18] The Óenach Carmain included a food market, a livestock market, and a market for foreign traders.[10] After the 9th century the Óenach Tailten was celebrated irregularly and it gradually died out.[19] It was revived for a period in the 20th century as the Tailteann Games.[13][18]\\n\\nA 15th century version of the Irish legend Tochmarc Emire (\"the Wooing of Emer\") is one of the earliest documents to record these festivities.[20]\\n\\nFrom the 18th century to the mid 20th century, many accounts of Lughnasadh customs and folklore were recorded. In 1962 The Festival of Lughnasa, a study of Lughnasadh by folklorist Máire MacNeill, was published.[21] MacNeill studied surviving Lughnasadh customs and folklore as well as the earlier accounts and medieval writings about the festival. She concluded that the evidence testified to the existence of an ancient festival around 1 August that involved the following:\\n\\nPilgrims climbing Croagh Patrick on \"Reek Sunday\". It is believed that climbing hills and mountains was a big part of the festival since ancient times, and the \"Reek Sunday\" pilgrimage is likely a continuation of this.\\n\\nA solemn cutting of the first of the corn of which an offering would be made to the deity by bringing it up to a high place and burying it; a meal of the new food and of bilberries of which everyone must partake; a sacrifice of a sacred bull, a feast of its flesh, with some ceremony involving its hide, and its replacement by a young bull; a ritual dance-play perhaps telling of a struggle for a goddess and a ritual fight; an installation of a [carved stone] head on top of the hill and a triumphing over it by an actor impersonating Lugh; another play representing the confinement by Lugh of the monster blight or famine; a three-day celebration presided over by the brilliant young god [Lugh] or his human representative. Finally, a ceremony indicating that the interregnum was over, and the chief god in his right place again.[22]\\n\\nAccording to MacNeill, the main theme that emerges from the folklore and rituals of Lughnasadh is a struggle for the harvest between two gods. One god – usually called Crom Dubh – guards the grain as his treasure. The other god – Lugh – must seize it for mankind.[23][24] Sometimes, this was portrayed as a struggle over a woman called Eithne, who represents the grain. Lugh also fights and defeats a figure representing blight.[23] MacNeill says that these themes can be seen in earlier Irish mythology, particularly in the tale of Lugh defeating Balor,[23] which seems to represent the overcoming of blight, drought and the scorching summer sun.[25] In surviving folklore, Lugh is usually replaced by Saint Patrick, while Crom Dubh is a pagan chief who owns a granary or a bull and who opposes Patrick, but is overcome and converted. Crom Dubh is likely the same figure as Crom Cruach and shares some traits with the Dagda and Donn.[23] He may be based on an underworld god like Hades and Pluto, who kidnaps the grain goddess Persephone but is forced to let her return to the world above before harvest time.[26]\\n\\nMany of the customs described by MacNeill and by medieval writers were being practised into the modern era, though they were either Christianized or shorn of any pagan religious meaning. Many of Ireland\\'s prominent mountains and hills were climbed at Lughnasadh. Some of the treks were eventually re-cast as Christian pilgrimages, the most well-known being Reek Sunday—the yearly pilgrimage to the top of Croagh Patrick in late July.[27] Other hilltop gatherings were secular and attended mostly by the youth. In Ireland, bilberries were gathered[28] and there was eating, drinking, dancing, folk music, games and matchmaking, as well as athletic and sporting contests such as weight-throwing, hurling and horse racing.[29] At some gatherings, everyone wore flowers while climbing the hill and then buried them at the summit as a sign that summer was ending.[30] In other places, the first sheaf of the harvest was buried.[31] There were also faction fights, whereby two groups of young men fought with sticks.[32] In 18th-century Lothian, rival groups of young men built towers of sods topped with a flag. For days, each group tried to sabotage the other\\'s tower, and at Lughnasadh they met each other in \\'battle\\'.[33] Bull sacrifices around Lughnasadh time were recorded as late as the 18th century at Cois Fharraige in Ireland (where they were offered to Crom Dubh) and at Loch Maree in Scotland (where they were offered to Saint Máel Ruba).[34] Special meals were made with the first produce of the harvest.[35] In the Scottish Highlands, people made a special cake called the lunastain, which may have originated as an offering to the gods.[36]\\n\\nAnother custom that Lughnasadh shared with Imbolc and Beltane was visiting holy wells. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking sunwise around the well. They would then leave offerings; typically coins or clooties (see clootie well).[37] Although bonfires were lit at some of the open-air gatherings in Ireland, they were rare and incidental to the celebrations.[38]\\n\\nTraditionally, Lughnasadh has always been reckoned as the first day of August. In recent centuries, however, much of the gatherings and festivities associated with it shifted to the nearest Sundays – either the last Sunday in July or first Sunday in August. It is believed this is because the coming of the harvest was a busy time and the weather could be unpredictable, which meant work days were too important to give up. As Sunday would have been a day of rest anyway, it made sense to hold celebrations then. The festival may also have been affected by the shift to the Gregorian calendar.[39]\\n\\nModern Lughnasadh customs [ edit ]\\n\\nIn Ireland, some of the mountain pilgrimages have survived. By far the most popular is the Reek Sunday pilgrimage at Croagh Patrick, which attracts tens of thousands of pilgrims each year. The Catholic Church in Ireland established the custom of blessing fields at Lughnasadh.\\n\\ncirca 1900, showing the wild goat (King Puck) atop his \\'throne\\' The Puck Fair1900, showing the wild goat (King Puck) atop his \\'throne\\'\\n\\nThe Puck Fair is held each year in early August in the town of Killorglin, County Kerry. It has been traced as far back as the 16th century but is believed to be a survival of a Lughnasadh festival. At the beginning of the three-day festival, a wild goat is brought into the town and crowned \\'king\\', while a local girl is crowned \\'queen\\'. The festival includes traditional music and dancing, a parade, arts and crafts workshops, a horse and cattle fair, and a market. It draws a great number of tourists each year.\\n\\nIn recent years, other towns in Ireland have begun holding yearly Lughnasa Festivals and Lughnasa Fairs. Like the Puck Fair, these often include traditional music and dancing, arts and crafts workshops, traditional storytelling, and markets. Such festivals have been held in Gweedore,[40] Sligo,[41] Brandon,[42] Rathangan[43] and a number of other places. Craggaunowen, an open-air museum in County Clare, hosts a yearly Lughnasa Festival at which historical re-enactors demonstrate elements of daily life in Gaelic Ireland. It includes displays of replica clothing, artefacts, weapons and jewellery.[44] A similar event has been held each year at Carrickfergus Castle in County Antrim.[45] In 2011, RTÉ aired a live television program from Craggaunowen at Lughnasa, called Lughnasa Live.[46]\\n\\nIn the Irish diaspora, survivals of the Lughnasadh festivities are often seen by some families still choosing August as the traditional time for family reunions and parties, though due to modern work schedules these events have sometimes been moved to adjacent secular holidays, such as the Fourth of July in the United States.[13][14]\\n\\nThe festival is referenced in Brian Friel\\'s play Dancing at Lughnasa (1990), which was made into a film of the same name.\\n\\nNeopaganism [ edit ]\\n\\nLughnasadh and Lughnasadh-based festivals are held by some Neopagans, especially Celtic Neopagans. However, their Lughnasadh celebrations can be very different despite the shared name. Some try to emulate the historic festival as much as possible,[47] while others base their celebrations on many sources, the Gaelic festival being only one of them.[48][49]\\n\\nNeopagans usually celebrate Lughnasadh on 1 August in the Northern Hemisphere and 1 February in the Southern Hemisphere, often beginning their festivities at sunset the evening before.[50][51][52][53][54] Some Neopagans celebrate it at the astronomical midpoint between the summer solstice and autumn equinox (or the full moon nearest this point).[55] In 2017, this is on 7 August in the Northern Hemisphere.[56]\\n\\nCeltic Reconstructionist [ edit ]\\n\\nCeltic Reconstructionists strive to reconstruct the pre-Christian religions of the Celts. Their religious practises are based on research and historical accounts,[47][57] but may be modified slightly to suit modern life. They avoid syncretism (i.e. combining practises from different cultures).\\n\\nCeltic Reconstructionists who follow Gaelic traditions tend to celebrate Lughnasadh at the time of \"first fruits\", or on the full moon nearest this time. In the Northeastern United States, this is often the time of the blueberry harvest, while in the Pacific Northwest the blackberries are often the festival fruit.[14][57] In Celtic Reconstructionism, Lughnasadh is seen as a time to give thanks to the spirits and deities for the beginning of the harvest season, and to propitiate them with offerings and prayers not to harm the still-ripening crops. The god Lugh is honoured by many at this time, and gentle rain on the day of the festival is seen as his presence and his bestowing of blessings. Many Celtic Reconstructionists also honour the goddess Tailtiu at Lughnasadh, and may seek to keep the Cailleachan from damaging the crops, much in the way appeals are made to Lugh.[14][57][58][59]\\n\\nWicca [ edit ]\\n\\nWiccans use the names \"Lughnasadh\" or \"Lammas\" for the first of their autumn harvest festivals. It is one of the eight yearly \"Sabbats\" of their Wheel of the Year, following Midsummer and preceding Mabon. It is seen as one of the two most auspicious times for handfasting, the other being at Beltane.[60] Some Wiccans mark the holiday by baking a figure of the \"corn god\" in bread, and then symbolically sacrificing and eating it.[50]\\n\\nSee also [ edit ]\\n\\nReferences [ edit ]',\n",
       " 'It is a gun battle people in the Shubra district in central Cairo still talk about six months after it happened. In a dispute over a piece of land he had seized amid the small shops and densely crowded streets, Mohammed Shaban, who had escaped from prison during the revolution, challenged the police to a fight. He told one policeman who tried to evict him \"to get out or we will kill you\". When other police arrived, two of them were wounded by gunshots and Shaban was killed along with a local plumber, shot dead by police who mistook him for a gunman.\\n\\n\"Mohammed Shaban\\'s family consider him a martyr but nobody else around here does,\" says Abu Hatem, a taxi driver living in Shubra. Not far away is the prison and police headquarters, a large, shabby, cream-coloured building with steel bars outside the windows and metal plates on the inside, pierced by a single hole through which a rifle can be fired. The prison was burned on 28 January last year by prisoners like Shaban and their relatives at the height of the Egyptian uprising against President Hosni Mubarak. The prisoners seized arms and the police fled from Shubra, but have since returned.\\n\\nThe story of the death of Shaban is one of several told by people in Shubra as an example of increased violence in Egypt since the revolution. One man who went to the police to report the kidnap of his child was told by a policeman that \"10 other children have been seized and are being held for ransom\". Car theft has become common. Many taxi drivers say they no longer dare to work at night.\\n\\nWe’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 $0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\\n\\nYet these tales of Egypt sinking into chaos are deceptive. There is more crime in Cairo than before the revolution because the police have been discredited by their corruption and brutality, can no longer act with impunity and often refuse to act at all. Poverty has increased in a city of 20 million people, a third of whom already lived in slums, so more will steal to survive.\\n\\nThe surprise is not that there is so much violence, but that there is so little. In Shubra people are frightened of chaos and criminality, but examples of violence like Mohammed Shaban\\'s shoot-out are still uncommon in a district into which are packed no less than three million Muslims and Copts.\\n\\nLocal people can point to only two shops looted during the revolution when the police disappeared from the streets. At one of them, selling beer and wine and called \"Drinkies\", the owner said they lost their stock but were otherwise unharmed.\\n\\nThe increased fear of violence is in part psychological because Egyptian society is not used to it, says Magda Kandil, executive director of the Egyptian Centre for Economic Studies (ECES), and while there is more crime, \"it is mostly about theft – 20,000 cars have been stolen\". The only place where there has been a general breakdown of order is in north Sinai where armed Bedouin carry out kidnappings and killings.\\n\\nCompared to most Arab uprisings last year, such as those in Libya, Yemen and Syria, political violence in Egypt has been moderate. \"Looked at historically this has been a remarkably peaceful revolution so far,\" says Professor Khaled Fahmy, head of the history department at the American University in Cairo. \"There has been no bloodbath.\" But he adds that Scaf (The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces), the ruling authority over the last year, has encouraged an exaggerated perception of insecurity in order to blame the revolutionaries for increasing crime and a faltering economy.\\n\\nAt street level, going by what happened in Shubra, these tactics are having some success and the return of the police is generally welcomed. Abu Hatem says that the police are chastened and no longer plant drugs on suspects as they used to. He says one reason the police fled so fast during the revolution was that \"the lower ranking police officers were afraid to appear in the streets because they believed people they had falsely accused might kill them\".\\n\\nIn the longer term, it may prove impossible for the army and police to restore the monopoly of power they enjoyed under the old regime. Egyptians retain a strong sense of hierarchy but power is fragmenting and the state is no longer absolute. The Interior Ministry in Cairo used to vet the promotion of everybody from judges to journalists. Even favourable mentions of the army in the press had to receive official permission.\\n\\nBut Cairo today is full of signs that this culture of subjugation is eroding. The street in which stands the enormous Interior Ministry building is sealed off by barbed wire and paramilitary police backed by armoured cars. But at one end of the street former policemen sacked last year were this week demonstrating to get their jobs back and chanting: \"Ministry of the Interior, we are your children, we are not thieves.\" The Maspero building, where much of the state media is based, is ringed by barbed wire and defended by soldiers with machine guns, but this week its ground floor had been taken over by 600 striking engineers demanding higher pay.\\n\\nThe activists who packed Tahrir Square a year ago are dispirited and speak of the triumph of the counter-revolution. They fear that the army, police and intelligence services are re-establishing their authority. But power in post-Mubarak Egypt is divided and may become more so. The Muslim Brotherhood and military, who would like to keep a supervisory role, are engaged in a long-term struggle.\\n\\nEverybody wants the revolution to improve their lives. Cairo bus drivers are on strike and have plenty to complain of. At the Moneib bus depot, Khalaf Sadk says: \"I\\'ve worked on the buses for 16 years and I get 600 Egyptian pounds (£63) a month for working an eight- to 10-hour day.\" Often he is unable to complete his route because of traffic jams and engine failure on his decrepit bus. Another striker, Khalaf Abdul Kadr, says the Public Transport Authority \"has no respect for its employees or their needs\".\\n\\nThere is a deep cynicism about the motives and actions of the state among most Egyptians. For instance, there is a foot-and-mouth epidemic among cattle in Egypt, but butchers in Cairo believe that officials are exaggerating its extent because they stand to make money from a rise in the price of chicken and fish. Professor Fahmy says: \"I think we are seeing a revolt against the modern Egyptian state system which was always against the welfare of Egyptians.\"\\n\\nThe political struggle means that none of the centres for power are really in charge or capable of taking important decisions. And this is at a moment when the Egyptian economy is teetering on the edge of crisis. Magda Kandil at the ECES sees the economic prospects as \"dismal\". She blames the authorities for pursuing populist policies, such as raising wages for state workers and stoking inflation. Central Bank reserves have fallen by more than half \"and waves of capital outflow could be of the magnitude of $12bn\". The government has been locked in negotiations with the IMF for a $3.2bn loan on which further aid from the Gulf oil states depends.\\n\\nThe Egyptian state machine is vast but dysfunctional at every level. Education and healthcare are inadequate and under-funded. A quarter of Egypt\\'s 85 million people live in shanty towns. One-third of the government\\'s budget is spent on subsidies, mostly for fuel, which benefit the better-off. Cheap gasoline means the streets are choked with traffic. Bottled butane gas used for cooking by the poor is heavily subsidised but subsidies are almost all siphoned off by middle men.\\n\\nThe authority of the Egyptian military and police will ebb unless they stage a coup which appears unlikely. But, even if they are edged out of power, it will take a long time to reconstruct the country they ruined during their 60-year-long rule.\\n\\nWe’ll tell you what’s true.

       " 'USDOT. March 2002. Corrosion cost and preventive strategies in the United States. U.S. Department of transportation, Federal highway administration. 784 pages.\\n\\nNACE. Corrosion costs and preventive strategies in the United States.\\n\\n[ United States infrastructure was built when the EROI of oil was very high and minerals had high metal concentrations. This study was done in 2002, since then, things have gotten much worse (see ASCE 2013 Infrastructure report card). ASCE estimates the bill is now $3.6 trillion by 2020. Globalization was made possible by really large ships that can be up to 80 times more energy efficient than trucks, and carry up to 90% of goods. Yet these behemoths last only 29 years on average before they’re scrapped, and double-hulls have made super-rust possible, accelerating corrosion. Alice Friedemann www.energyskeptic.com ]\\n\\nSummary of Total Cost\\n\\nThe cost of corrosion was estimated for the individual economic sectors. The total cost due to the impact of corrosion was $137.9 billion per year. Since not all economic sectors were examined, the sum of the estimated costs does not represent the total cost of corrosion to the entire U.S. economy. By estimating the percentage of U.S. GDP of the sectors for which corrosion costs were not determined and extrapolating the cost numbers to the entire U.S. economy, a total cost of corrosion of $276 billion was estimated. This is approximately 3.1 percent of the nation’s GDP. The indirect corrosion costs (i.e., the costs incurred by other than owners and operators as a result of corrosion) are conservatively estimated to be equal to the direct cost; giving a total direct plus indirect cost of $552 billion (6 percent of the GDP). Evidence of the large indirect corrosion costs are: (1) lost productivity because of outages, delays, failures, and litigation; (2) taxes and overhead on the cost of corrosion portion of goods and services; and (3) indirect costs of non-owner/operator activities.\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n\\nThe U.S. infrastructure and transportation system allows for a high level of mobility and freight activity for the nearly 270 million residents and 7 million business establishments. In 1997, more than 230 million motor vehicles, ships, airplanes, and railroad cars were used on 6.4 million km (4 million mi) of highways, railroads, and waterways connecting all parts of the United States. The transportation infrastructure also includes more than 800,000 km (approximately 500,000 mi) of oil and gas transmission pipelines, 8.5 million tanks for hazardous materials storage, and 18,000 public and private airports. The annual direct cost of corrosion in the infrastructure category is estimated at $22.6 billion.\\n\\nHighway Bridges: Based on the National Bridge Inventory Database, there are 586,000 bridges in the United States, half built between 1950 and 1994. Of this total, 435,000 bridges are made from steel and conventional reinforced concrete, 108,000 bridges are constructed using pre-stressed concrete, and the balance is made using other materials of construction. Approximately 15 percent of the bridges are structurally deficient, primarily due to corrosion of steel and steel reinforcement. The dollar impact of corrosion on highway bridges is considerable. The annual direct cost of corrosion for highway bridges is estimated to be $8.3 billion, consisting of $3.8 billion for the annual cost to replace structurally deficient bridges over the next 10 years, $2.0 billion for maintenance and cost of capital for concrete bridge decks, $2.0 billion for maintenance and cost of capital for concrete substructures (minus decks), and $0.5 billion for maintenance painting of steel bridges. Life-cycle analysis estimates indirect costs to the user due to traffic delays and lost productivity at more than 10 times the direct cost of corrosion.\\n\\nConventional Reinforced-Concrete Bridges. The primary cause of reinforced-concrete bridge deterioration is chloride-induced corrosion of the black steel reinforcement, resulting in expansion forces in the concrete that produce cracking and spalling of the concrete. The chloride comes from either marine exposure or the use of deicing salts for snow and ice removal. Because the use of deicing salts is likely to continue, if not increase, little can be done to prevent bridge structures from being exposed to corrosive chloride salts.\\n\\nThe expected service life of a newly constructed bridge is typically 75 years and up to 120 years for stainless steel rebar construction.\\n\\nSteel Bridges. The primary cause of corrosion of steel bridges is the exposure of the steel to atmospheric conditions. This corrosion is greatly enhanced due to marine (salt spray) exposures and industrial environments. The only corrosion prevention method for these structures is to provide a barrier coating (paint).\\n\\nGas and Liquid Transmission Pipelines: There are more than (328,000 mi) of natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines, (74,000 mi) of crude oil transmission and gathering pipelines, and (82,000 mi) of hazardous liquid transmission pipelines. For all natural gas pipeline companies, the total investment in 1998 was $63.1 billion, from which a total revenue of $13.6 billion was generated. For liquid pipeline companies, the investment was $30.2 billion, from which a revenue of $6.9 billion was generated. At an estimated replacement cost of ($1,117,000 per mi), the asset replacement value of the transmission pipeline system in the United States is $541 billion; therefore a significant investment is at risk with corrosion being the primary factor in controlling the life of the asset. The average annual corrosion-related cost is estimated at $7.0 billion, which can be divided into the cost of capital (38 percent), operation and maintenance (52, percent), and failures (10 percent). With a range of corrosion O&M cost of $3,100 to $6,200 per krn ($5,000 to $10,000 per mi), the total corrosion O&M cost ranges from $2.42 billion to $4.84 billion.\\n\\nIf corrosion is allowed to progress unchecked, the integrity of the pipeline will eventually be compromised. Depending on the flaw size, the pipeline material properties, and the pressure, either a leak will form or a rupture will occur. Typically, a rupture of a high-pressure natural gas pipeline results in a sufficient release of stored energy to blow the pipeline out of the ground. An annual direct cost of corrosion-related accidents for both gas and liquid pipelines is estimated to range from $471 million to $875 million.\\n\\nA liquid (non-compressible) pipeline has less stored energy than a natural gas pipeline; therefore. a rupture does not immediately result in a major explosion. However, once leaked out into the environment, a major explosion can occur upon ignition of an explosive liquid product. For a hazardous liquid product pipeline, the environmental impact can be as significant as the risk of an explosion. The risk of an oil leak from the TransAlaskan pipeline, for example, has continued to be the primary driver for the aggressive corrosion prevention and inspection program maintained by the operator. Of major concern is the risk of product leakage into surface waters, thereby, contaminating water supplies.\\n\\nCorrosion of the pipe wall can occur either internally or externally. Internal corrosion occurs when corrosive liquids or condensates are transported through the pipelines. Depending on the nature of the corrosive liquid and the transport velocity, different forms of corrosion may occur, including uniform corrosion, pitting/crevice corrosion, and erosion-corrosion. Figure 3 shows an example of internal corrosion that occurred in a crude oil pipeline due to high levels of saltwater and carbon dioxide (CO2).\\n\\nThere are several different modes of external corrosion identified on buried pipelines. The primary mode of corrosion is a macro-cell form of localized corrosion due to the heterogeneous nature of soils, local damage of the external coatings (holidays), and/or the disbandment of external coatings. Figure 4 shows typical external corrosion on a buried pipeline. The 25-mm-(1 -in-) grid pattern was placed on the pipe surface to permit sizing of the corrosion and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) wall thickness measurements.\\n\\nStray Current Corrosion. Corrosion can be accelerated through ground currents from dc sources. Electrified railroads, mining operations, and other similar industries that utilize large amounts of dc current sometimes allow a significant portion of current to use a ground path return to their power sources. These currents often utilize metallic structures (pipelines) in close proximity as a part of the return path. This “stray” current can be picked up by the pipeline and discharged back into the soil at some distance down the pipeline close to the current return. Current pick-up on the pipe is the same process as cathodic protection, which tends to mitigate corrosion. The process of current discharge off the pipe and through the soil of a dc current accelerates corrosion of the pipe wall at the discharge point. This type of corrosion is called stray current corrosion.\\n\\nMicrobiologicallyInfluenced Corrosion (MIC). Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) is defined as corrosion that is influenced by the presence and activities of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. It has been estimated that 20 to 30 percent of all corrosion on pipelines is MIC-related. MIC can affect either the external or the internal surfaces of a pipeline. Microorganisms located at the metal surface do not directly attack the metal or cause a unique form of corrosion. The byproducts from the organisms promote several forms of corrosion, including pitting, crevice corrosion, and under-deposit corrosion. Typically, the products of a growing microbiological colony accelerate the corrosion process by either: (1) interacting with the corrosion products to prevent natural film-forming characteristics of the corrosion products that would inhibit firther corrosion, or (2) providing an additional reduction reaction that accelerates the corrosion process. A variety of bacteria have been implicated in exacerbating corrosion of underground pipelines and these fall into the broad classifications of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Obligate aerobic bacteria can only survive in the presence of oxygen, while obligate anaerobic bacteria can only survive in its absence. A third classification is facultative aerobic bacteria that prefer aerobic conditions, but can live under anaerobic conditions. Common obligate anaerobic bacteria implicated in corrosion include sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) and metal-reducing bacteria. Common obligate aerobic bacteria include metal-oxidizing bacteria, while acid-producing bacteria are facultative aerobes. The most aggressive attacks generally take place in the presence of microbial communities that contain a variety of types of bacteria. In these communities, the bacteria act cooperatively to produce conditions favorable to the growth of each species. For example, obligate anaerobic bacteria can thrive in aerobic environments when they are present beneath biofilms/deposits in which aerobic bacteria consume the oxygen. In the case of underground pipelines, the most aggressive attack has been associated with acid-producing bacteria in such bacterial communities\\n\\nStress Corrosion Cracking. A particularly detrimental form of pipeline corrosion is known as stress corrosion cracking (SCC). SCC is defined as the brittle fracture of a normally ductile metal by the conjoint action of a specific corrosive environment and a tensile stress. On underground pipelines, SCC affects only the external surface of the pipe, which is exposed to soil and groundwater at locations where the coating is disbonded. The primary component of the tensile stress on an underground pipeline is in the hoop direction and results from the operating pressure. Residual stresses from fabrication, installation, and damage in service contribute to the total stress. Individual cracks initiate in the longitudinal direction on the outside surface of the pipe. The cracks typically occur in colonies that may contain hundreds or thousands of individual cracks. Over time, the cracks in the colonies interlink and may cause leaks or ruptures once a critical-size flaw is achieved. Figure 7 shows an SCC hydrostatic test failure on a high-pressure gas pipeline (see later section on hydrostatic testing). The two basic types of SCC on underground pipelines that have been identified are classical or “high pH” cracking (pH 9 to lo), which propagates intergranularly, and “near-neutral pH” cracking, which propagates transgranularly. Each form of SCC initiates and propagates under unique environmental conditions. Near-neutral pH SCC (< pH 8) is most commonly found on pipelines with polyethylene tape coatings that shield the cathodic protection current.(5) The environment that develops beneath the tape coating and causes this form of cracking is dilute carbonic acid. Carbon dioxide from the decay of organic material in the soil dissolves in the electrolyte beneath the disbonded coating to form the carbonic acid solution. High-pH SCC is most commonly found on pipelines with asphalt or coal tar coatings. The high-pH environment is a concentrated carbonate bicarbonate solution that develops as a result of the presence of carbon dioxide in the groundwater and the cathodic protection system.\\n\\nFresh Water. Airborne or splash zone attack is normally not a problem at freshwater facilities; however, air pollution can cause potential problems. Under certain flow conditions, such as turbulent flow or cavitation, fresh water can cause severe corrosion to submerged metallic elements. Ice damage also can limit the effectiveness of coatings on bulkhead walls and support piling. Piers and docks, bulkheads and retaining walls, locks. dams, and navigational aids exposed to freshwater environment experience corrosion-related problems. The most common areas of attack include submerged and splash zones on support piles (piers. docks, and navigational aids) and steel sheet piling (bulkheads and retaining walls). These zones are also found on locks (steel gates, hinges. intake’discharge culverts, valves, and sheet pile walls), dams (steel gates, hinges. intakeidischarge culverts. grates, and debris booms). and navigational aids (anchorages).\\n\\nHazardous Materials Storage: There are approximately 8.5 million regulated and non-regulated aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) and underground storage tanks (USTs) for hazardous materials (HAZMAT) in the United States. While these tanks represent a large investment, and good maintenance practices would be in the best interest of the owners, federal and state environmental regulators are concerned with the environmental impact of spills from leaking tanks. In 1988, the US. Environmental Protection Agency set a December 1998 deadline for UST owners to comply with the requirement to have corrosion control on all tanks, as well as overfill and spill protection. Thus, tank owners face considerable costs related to clean-up and penalties imposed by the government if they would not be in compliance. It is estimated that the annual cost of corrosion for ASTs is $4.5 billion and for USTs is $2.5 billion per year, resulting in a total annual direct corrosion cost of $7.0 billion.\\n\\nThe largest costs are incurred when leaking USTs must be replaced with new tanks. The soil remediation costs and oil spill clean-up costs are significant as well. In the last 10 years, the most common problem associated with USTs occurred at gasoline service stations that did not have corrosion protection on their USTs.\\n\\nUtilities\\n\\nUtilities form an essential part of the US, economy by supplying gas, water, electricity, and communication. All utility companies combined spent $42.3 billion on capital goods in 1998, an increase of 9 3 percent from 1997. Of this total, $22.4 billion was used for structures and $19.9 billion was used for equipment. The total annual direct cost of corrosion in the utility category is estimated to be $47.9 billion.\\n\\nGas Distribution: The natural gas distribution system includes 1,730,000 miles of relatively small-diameter, low-pressure piping, which is divided into 1,080,000 miles of distribution main and 650,000 miles of services. There are approximately 55 million services in the distribution system. A large percentage of the mains (57 percent) and services (46 percent) are made of steel, cast iron, or copper, which are subject to corrosion. The total annual direct cost of corrosion was estimated at approximately $5.0 billion.\\n\\nThe typical distribution of piping diameters is between 40 mm and 150 mm (1.5 in and 6 in) for main distribution piping and 13 mm to 20 mm (0.5 in to 0.75 in) for service piping. A small percentage of mains and services is larger diameter pipe, typically for commercial and industrial application. Several different materials have been used for distribution piping. Historically, distribution mains were primarily made of carbon steel pipe; however, since the 1970s, a large portion of the gas distribution main lines have been made of plastic, mostly polyethylene (PE), but sometimes polyvinyl chloride (PVC). A large percentage of mains (57 percent) and services (46 percent) are made of metal (steel, cast iron, or copper). The methods for monitoring corrosion on the lines are the same as those used for transmission pipelines; however, leak detection is the most widely used technique.\\n\\nDrinking Water and Sewer Svstems: According to the American Waterworks Association (AWWA) industry database, there is approximately 876,000 mi of municipal water piping in the United States. This number is not exact, since most water utilities do not have complete records of their piping system. The sewer system consists of approximately 16,400 publicly owned treatment facilities releasing some 155 million m3 41 billion gallons) of wastewater per day (1995). The total annual direct cost of corrosion for the nation’s drinking water and sewer systems was estimated at $36.0 billion. This cost was contributed to by the cost of replacing aging infrastructure. the cost of unaccounted-for water through leaks, the cost of corrosion inhibitors, the cost of internal mortar linings, and the cost of external coatings and cathodic protection.\\n\\nAmericans consume and use approximately 550 L of drinking water per person per day, for a total annual quantity of approximately 56.7 billion m’. The treated drinking water is transported through 1.4 million km of municipal water piping. The water piping is subject to internal and external corrosion. resulting in pipe leaks and water-main breaks. The total cost of corrosion for the drinking water and sewer systems includes the cost of replacing aging infrastructure. the cost of unaccounted-for water, the cost of corrosion inhibitors, the cost of internal cement mortar linings, the cost of external coatings, and the cost of cathodic protection.\\n\\nIn March 2000, the Water Infrastructure Network WIN) estimated the current annual cost for new investments, maintenance, operation, and financing of the national drinking water system at $38.5 billion per year, and of the sewer system at $27.5 billion per year. The total cost of corrosion was estimated from these numbers by assuming that at least 50 percent of the maintenance and operation costs are for replacing aging (corrosion) infrastructure, while the other 50 percent would be for system expansions. This results in an estimated cost of corrosion for drinking water systems of $19.25 billion per year and for sewer systems of $13.75 billion per year. WIN stated that the current spending levels are insuficient to prevent large failure rates in the next 20 years. The WIN report was presented in response to a 1998 study(”) by AWWA and a 1997 study by the EPA. Those studies had already identified the need for major investments to maintain the aging water infrastructure. In addition to the costs for replacing aging infrastructure, there is the cost for unaccounted-for water. One city reported a constant percentage of unaccounted-for water of 20 percent in the last 25 years, with 89 percent of its main breaks directly related to corrosion. Nationally, it is estimated that approximately 15 percent of the treated water is lost. The treatment of water that never reaches the consumer results in inflated prices (national lost water is estimated at $3.0 billion per year) and extra capacity in treatment facilities to produce the lost water. Adding these three major cost items results in a total annual cost of corrosion of $36.0 billion per year for drinking water and sewer systems combined.\\n\\nElectrical Utilities: The electrical utility industry is a major provider of energy in the United States. The total amount of electricity sold in the United States in 1998 was 3,240 billion GWh at a cost to the consumers of $218 billion. Electricity generation plants can be divided into seven generic types: fossil fuel, nuclear, hydroelectric, cogeneration, geothermal, solar, and wind. The majority of electric power in the United States is generated by fossil and nuclear supply systems. The total annual direct cost of corrosion in the electrical utility industry in 1998 is estimated at $6.9 billion, with the largest amounts for nuclear power at $4.2 billion and fossil fuel at $1.9 billion, and smaller amounts for hydraulic and other power at $0.15 billion, and transmission and distribution at $0.6 billion.\\n\\nThe fossil fuel sector (including gas turbines and combined cycle plants) is the largest, with a generating capacity of approximately 488 GW, and a total generation of 2.2 million GWh in 1998. In 1998, approximately 102 nuclear stations were operational, with a generating capacity of 97.1 GW, and a total generation of 0.67 million GWh.\\n\\nThe total direct cost of corrosion in the electric utility industry in 1998 is estimated at $6.889 billion per year. In comparison, an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) study(“‘ estimated the cost of corrosion to the user/consumer to be $17.27 billion per year.\\n\\nBecause of the complex and often corrosive environments in which power plants operate, corrosion has been a serious problem, with a significant impact on the operation of the plants. In the 1970s and the 1980s, major efforts were spent on understanding and controlling corrosion in both nuclear and fossil fuel steam plants, and significant progress was made. However, with the aging of several plants, old problems persist and new ones appear. For example, corrosion continues to be a problem with electrical generators and with turbines. Specifically, stress corrosion cracking in steam generators in PWR plants and boiler tube failures in fossil fuel plants continue to be problems. There are further indications that aging of buried structures, such as service water piping, has started to result in leaks that cannot be tolerated\\n\\nTelecommunications: The telecommunications infrastructure includes hardware such as electronics, computers, and data transmitters, as well as equipment shelters and the towers used to mount antennas, transmitters, receivers, and television and telephone systems. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the total value of shipments for communications equipment in 1999 was $84 billion. An important factor for corrosion cost is the additional cost of protecting towers and shelters, such as painting and galvanizing. In addition, corrosion of buried copper grounding beds, as well as galvanic corrosion of the grounded steel structures, contributes to the corrosion cost. For this sector, no corrosion cost was determined because of the lack of information on this rapidly changing industry. Many components are being replaced before physically failing because the technology has become obsolete in a short period of time.\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nThe transportation category includes vehicles and equipment, such as motor vehicles, aircraft. railroad cars, and hazardous materials transport, that make use of the U.S. highways, waterways, railroads, and airports. The annual cost of corrosion in the transportation category is estimated at $29.7 billion.\\n\\nMotor Vehicles: U.S. consumers, businesses, and government organizations own more than 200 million registered motor vehicles. Assuming an average value of $5,000, the total investment Americans have made in motor vehicles can be estimated at more than $1 trillion. Since the 1980s, car manufacturers have increased the corrosion resistance of vehicles by using corrosion-resistant materials, employing better manufacturing processes, and by designing corrosion-resistant vehicles. Although significant progress has been made, further improvement can be achieved in the corrosion resistance of individual components, such as fuel and brake systems, and electrical and electronic components. The total annual direct cost of corrosion is estimated at $23.4 billion, which is divided into the following three components: (1) increased manufacturing costs due to corrosion engineering and the use of corrosion-resistant materials ($2.56 billion per year), (2) repairs and maintenance necessitated by corrosion ($6.45 billion per year), and (3) corrosion-related depreciation of vehicles ($14.46 billion per year).\\n\\nThe total cost of corrosion to owners of motor vehicles is estimated at $23.4 billion per year or 79 percent of the Transportation category (see figure 13). This cost is divided into the following three components: (1) increased manufacturing costs due to corrosion engineering and the use of corrosion-resistant materials ($2.56 billion per year), (2) repairs and maintenance necessitated by corrosion ($6.45 billion per year), and (3) corrosion-related depreciation of vehicles ($14.46 billion per year).\\n\\nShips: The U.S. flag fleet can be divided into several categories as follows: the Great Lakes with 737 vessels at (62 billion ton-mi), inland with 33,668 vessels at (294 billion ton-mi), ocean with 7,014 vessels at (350 billion ton-mi), recreational with 12.3 million boats, and cruise ship with 122 boats serving North American ports (5.4 million passengers). The total annual direct cost of corrosion to the U.S. shipping industry is estimated at $2.7 billion. This cost is divided into costs associated with new construction ($1.1 billion), with maintenance and repairs ($0.8 billion), and with corrosion-related downtime ($0.8 billion).\\n\\nRailroads: In 1997, there were nine Class I freight railroads (railroads with operating revenues of more than $256.4 million). These railroads accounted for 71 percent of the industry’s (170,508 mi) of railroad. There were 35 regional railroads (those with operating revenues between $40 million and $256.4 million and/or operating at least 560 km (350 mi) of railroad). The regional railroads operated 34,546 km (21,466 mi) of railroad. Finally, there were 5 13 local railroads operating more than 45,300 km (28,149 mi) of railroad. The elements that are subject to corrosion include metal members, such as rail and steel spikes; however, corrosion damage to railroad components are either limited or go unreported. Hence, a corrosion cost could not be determined.\\n\\nOne area where corrosion has been identified is in electrified rail systems, such as those used for local transit authorities. Stray currents from the electrified systems can inflict significant and costly corrosion on non-railroad-related underground structures such as gas pipelines, waterlines, and underground storage tanks.\\n\\nRailroad Cars: In 1998, 1.47 million freight cars and 1,962 passenger cars were reported to operate in the United States. Covered hoppers at 28 percent make up the largest portion of the freight-car fleet, with tanker cars making up the second largest portion at 18 percent. The type of commodities transported range from coal (largest volume) to chemicals, motor vehicles, farm products, food products, and metallic and non-metallic ores and minerals. Railroad cars suffer from both external and internal corrosion. It is estimated that the total annual direct cost of corrosion is approximately $0.5 billion, divided over external coatings ($0.25 billion) and internal coatings and linings ($0.25 billion).\\n\\nIt is estimated that the total annual corrosion-related maintenance cost for railroad cars is approximately $504 million ($958 million for external coatings and $246 niillion for internal coatings and liners\\n\\nThe rate of corrosion has to be controlled in order to: ( 1) prolong the service life of the car. (2) prevent contamination of the transported product, such as food products or high-purity chemicals, and (3) prevent hazardous spills that could contaminate the environment and pose a public safety hazard. Protection from internal corrosion is achieved by using organic coating systems or rubber linings. As an alternative. cars for certain corrosive cargo services are manufactured from corrosion-resistant materials, such as aluminum or stainless steel. which raises the price of a car twofold.\\n\\nWaterways and Ports: In the United States, (25,000 mi) of commercial navigable waterways serve 41 states, including all states east of the Mississippi River. Hundreds of locks facilitate travel along these waterways. In January 1999, 135 of the 276 locks had exceeded their 50-year design life. The oldest operating locks in the United States are Kentucky River Locks 1 and 2. U.S. ports play an important role in connecting waterways, railroads, and highways. The nation’s ports include 1,914 deep-water (seacoast and Great Lakes) and 1,812 along inland waterways. Corrosion is typically found in piers and docks. bulkheads and retraining walls, mooring structures, and navigational aids. There is no formal tracking of corrosion-related costs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimated annual corrosion-related costs for locks and dams to be approximately $70 million at 5 percent of the O&M budget of $1.4 billion.(39′ Because of the aging of the structures however, high replacement costs are anticipated due, in part, to corrosion. The annual corrosion cost of ports and waterways owned and/or operated by public port authorities is estimated at $182 million.’401 The U.S. Coast Guard maintains navigational aids such as light structures, buoys, and other saltwater and freshwater exposed structures. In 1999, the corrosion-related cost for maintaining these structures was estimated at $4 1 million. The total annual cost of corrosion for waterways and ports is $293 million ($70 million + $1 82 million + $4 1 million). This must be a low estimate since the costs of harbor and other marine structures are not included.\\n\\nThe reinforced-concrete structures exposed to the marine environment suffer premature corrosion-induced deterioration by chlorine ions in seawater. Corrosion is typically found in piers and docks, bulkheads and retaining walls, mooring structures, and navigational aids. The marine environment can have varying effects on different materials depending on the specific zones of exposure. Atmosphere, splash, tide, immersion, and subsoil have very different characteristics and, therefore, have different influences on corrosion. Atmospherically exposed submerged zones and splash zones typically experience the most corrosion. These zones are found on piers and docks (ladders, railings, cranes, and steel support piles), bulkheads and retaining walls (steel sheet piling, steel-reinforced concrete elements, backside, and anchors on structures retaining dredged fill), and mooring structures and dams (steel gates, hinges, intakeidischarge culverts, grates, and debris booms). Stationary navigational aids suffer from corrosion of support piles and steel-reinforced concrete pile caps. Floating steel buoys are subject to corrosion as well.\\n\\nAircraft: In 1998, the combined aircraft fleet operated by U.S. airlines was more than 7,000, of which approximately 4,000 were turbojets. The fleet includes the Boeing 707, DC-9, Boeing 727, DC-10, and the earlier versions of the Boeing 737 and 747. At the start of the jet age (1950s to 1960s), little or no attention was paid to corrosion and corrosion control. One of the concerns is the continued aging of the airplanes beyond the 20-year design life. Only the most recent designs (Boeing 777 and late version 737) have incorporated significant improvements in corrosion prevention and control in design and manufacturing. The total annual direct cost of corrosion to the U.S. aircraft industry is estimated at $2.2 billion, which includes the cost of design and manufacturing ($0.2 billion), corrosion maintenance ($1.7 billion), and downtime ($0.3 billion).\\n\\nThe annual (1996) corrosion cost to the U.S. aircraft industry is estimated at $2.225 billion, which includes the cost of design and manufacturing at $0.225 billion, corrosion maintenance at $1.7 billion, and downtime due to corrosion at $0.3 billion (see figure 15). With the availability of new corrosion-resistant materials and an increased awareness of the importance of corrosion to the integrity and operation ofjet aircraft, the current design service life of 20 years has been extended to 40 years without jeopardizing structural integrity and significantly increasing the cost of operation.’\\n\\nAirports: The United States has the world’s most extensive airport system, which is essential to national transportation and the U.S. economy. According to 1999 Bureau of Transportation Statistics figures, there were 5.324 public-use airports and 13,774 private-use airports in the United States. A typical airport infrastructure is complex. and components that might be subject to corrosion include the natural gas distribution system, jet fuel storage and distribution system, deicing storage and distribution system, vehicle fueling systems, natural gas feeders, dry fire lines, parking garages, and runway lighting. Generally, each of these systems is owned or operated by different organizations or companies; therefore, the impact of corrosion on an airport as a whole is not known or documented. However, the airports do not have any specific corrosion-related problems, that have not been described elsewhere in this report.\\n\\nHazardous Materials Transport: According to U.S .Department of transportation, there are approximately 300 million hazardous materials shipments of more than 3.1 billion metric tons annually in the United States. Bulk transportation of hazardous materials includes overland shipping by tanker truck and rail car, and by special containers that are loaded onto vehicles. Over water, ships loaded with specialized containers, tanks, and drums are used. In small quantities, hazardous materials require specially designed packaging for truck and air shipment. The total annual direct cost of corrosion for hazardous materials transport is more than $0.9 billion. The elements of the annual corrosion cost include the cost of transporting vehicles ($0.4 billion per year), the cost of specialized packaging (S0.5 billion per year), and the direct and indirect costs ($0.5 million per year and an unknown value, respectively) of accidental releases and corrosion-related transportation incidents.\\n\\nThe total cost of corrosion for HAZMAT transportation is at least $0.887 billion per year (see figure 17). The elements of this cost include the corrosion-related cost of transport vehicles ($400 million per year), the cost of specialized packaging ($487 million per year), and the direct cost of $0.5 million per year of accidental releases and other corrosion-related transportation incidents. The indirect costs of releases are not known.\\n\\nProduction and Manufacturing\\n\\nThis category includes industries that produce and manufacture products of crucial importance to the U.S. economy and the standard of living in the United States. These include oil production, mining, petroleum refining, chemical and pharmaceutical production, and agricultural and food production. The total annual direct cost of corrosion in this category was estimated to be $17.6 billion.\\n\\nOil and Gas Exploration and Production: Domestic oil and gas production can be considered to be a stagnant industry, because most of the significant available onshore oil and gas reserves have been exploited. Oil production in the United States in 1998 consisted of 3.04 billion barrels. The significant recoverable reserves left to be discovered and produced are probably limited to less convenient locations such as in deep water offshore, remote arctic locations, and difficult-to-manage reservoirs with unconsolidated sands. The total annual direct cost of corrosion in the U.S, oil and gas production industry is estimated at $1.4 billion, made up of $0.6 billion for surface piping and facility costs, $0.5 billion in downhole tubing expenses, and $0.3 billion in capital expenditures related to corrosion.\\n\\nThe majority of cost-savings for any oil production facility is in the prevention of failure in one of the production arteries, such as downhole tubing, surface pipelines, and production vessel. Downhole tubing, surface pipelines, pressure vessels, and storage tanks in oil and gas production are subject to internal corrosion by water, which is enhanced by the presence of CO2 and H2S in the gas phase. Internal corrosion control is a major cost item consideration. The total cost of corrosion in the U.S. oil and gas production industry is estimated to be $1.372 billion annually, made up of $589 million for surface piping and facility costs. $463 million in downhole tubing expenses, and $320 million in capital expenditures related to corrosion.\\n\\nMining: In the mining industry, corrosion is not considered to be a significant problem. There is a general consensus that the life-limiting factors for mining equipment are wear and mechanical damage rather than corrosion. Maintenance painting, however, is heavily relied upon to prevent corrosion, with an annual estimated expenditure for the coal mining industry of $0.1 billion.\\n\\nPetroleum Refining: Petroleum is the single largest source of energy for the United States. The nation uses twice as much petroleum as either coal or natural gas. The U.S. refineries represent approximately 23% of the world’s petroleum production, and the United States has the largest refining capacity in the world, with 163 refineries. In 1996, U.S. refineries supplied more than 18 million barrels per day of refined petroleum products. The total annual direct cost of corrosion is estimated at $3.7 billion. Of this total, maintenance-related expenses are estimated at $1.8 billion, vessel turnaround expenses at $1.4 billion, and fouling costs are approximately $0.5 billion annually.\\n\\nThe total annual cost of corrosion for the petroleum refining industry is estimated at $3.692 billion, which is 2 1 percent of the Production and Manufacturing category (see figure 2 1). Of this total, maintenance-related expenses are estimated at $1.767 billion, vessel turnaround expenses at $1.425 billion, and fouling costs are approximately $0.500 billion annually. The costs associated with corrosion control in refineries include both the processing side and water handling. Corrosion-related issues regarding the processing side include the handling of organic acids, referred to as naphthenic corrosion, and sulfur species, particularly at high temperatures, as well as water carryover in processing vessels and pipelines. Water handling includes concerns with corrosives such as H2S, C02, chlorides, and high levels of dissolved solids.\\n\\nIncreasing regulation and pressure from environmental groups have forced the ref neries to implement defensive strategies where little attention is paid to improved corrosion control. This is compounded by overseas market forces, such as OPEC, which control the price of the feedstock oil. In a commodity-driven industry that is struggling to compete in the world market, investment in more effective corrosion control strategies often takes a backseat to across-the-board cost-cutting measures. The majority of pipelines and vessels in refineries are constructed of carbon steel, and opportunities for significant savings exist through the use of low-alloy steels and alloy-clad vessels, particularly as increasingly higher fractions of acidic crude oil are refined.\\n\\nChemical, Petrochemical, and Pharmaceutical: The chemical, petrochemical, and pharmaceutical industries play a major role in the U.S. economy by providing a wide range of products. The chemical industry includes those manufacturing facilities that produce bulk or specialty compounds by chemical reactions between organic and/or inorganic materials. The petrochemical industry includes those manufacturing facilities that create substances from raw hydrocarbon materials such as crude oil and natural gas. The pharmaceutical industry formulates, fabricates, and processes medicinal products from raw materials. The total annual direct cost of corrosion for this industry sector is estimated at $1.7 billion per year (8 percent of total capital expenditures). No calculation was made for the indirect costs of production outages or indirect costs related to catastrophic failures. The costs of operation and maintenance related to corrosion were not readily available; estimating these costs would require detailed study of data records of individual companies.\\n\\nPulp and Paper: The $165 billion pulp, paper, and allied product industry supplies the United States with approximately 300 kg of paper per person per year. More than 300 pulp mills and more than 550 paper mills support its production. The total annual direct cost of corrosion is estimated at $6.0 billion, with the majority of this cost in the paper and paperboard-making industry, and calculated as a fraction of the maintenance costs. No information was found to estimate the corrosion costs related to the loss of capital.\\n\\nAgricultural: Agriculture operations are producing livestock, poultry, or other animal specialties and their products, and producing crops, including fruits and greenhouse or nursery products. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, there are approximately 1.9 million farms in the United States. Based on a 1997 census, the total value of farm machinery and equipment is approximately $15 billion per year. The two main reasons for replacing machinery or equipment include upgrading old equipment and substituting because of wear and corrosion. Discussions with people in this industrial sector resulted in an estimate of corrosion costs in the range of 5 percent to 10 percent of the value of all new equipment. The total annual direct cost of corrosion in the agricultural production industry is estimated at $1.1 billion.\\n\\nFood Processing: The food processing industry is one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, accounting for approximately 14 percent of the total US, manufacturing output. Sales for food-processing companies totaled $265.5 billion in 1999. Because of quality-of-food requirements, stainless steel is widely used. Assuming that the stainless steel consumption and cost in this industry is entirely attributed to corrosion, a total annual direct cost of corrosion is estimated at 52.1 billion. This cost includes stainless steel usage for beverage production, food machinery, cutlery and utensils, commercial and restaurant equipment, appliances, aluminum cans, and the use of corrosion inhibitors.\\n\\nElectronics: Corrosion in electronic components manifests itself in several ways. Computers, integrated circuits, and microchips are now an integral part of all technology-intensive industry products, ranging from aerospace and automotive to medical equipment and consumer products, and are therefore exposed to a variety of environmental conditions. Corrosion in electronic components are insidious and cannot be readily detected; therefore, when corrosion failure occurs, it is often dismissed as just a failure and the part or component is replaced. Particularly in the case of consumer electronics, devices would become technologically obsolete long before corrosion-induced failures would occur. However, capital-intensive industries, with significant investment in durable equipment with a considerable number of electronic components, such as the defense industry and the airline industry, tend to keep the equipment for longer periods of time, and corrosion is likely to become an issue. Although the cost of corrosion in the electronics sector could not be estimated, it has been suggested that a significant part of all electronic component failures are caused by corrosion.\\n\\nHome Appliances The appliance industry is one of the largest consumer product industries. For practical purposes, two categories of appliances are distinguished: “Major Home Appliances” and “Comfort Conditioning Appliances.” In 1999, a total of 70.7 million major home appliances and a total of 49.5 million comfort conditioning appliances were sold in the United States, for a total of 120.2 million appliances. The cost of corrosion in home appliances includes the cost of purchasing replacement appliances because of premature failure due to corrosion. For water heaters alone, the replacement cost was estimated at $460 million per year, using a low estimate of 5 percent of the replacement being corrosion-related. The cost of internal corrosion protection for all appliances includes the use of sacrificial anodes ($780 million per year), corrosion-resistant materials (no cost estimate), and internal coatings (no cost estimate). The cost of external corrosion protection using coatings was estimated at $260 million per year. Therefore, the estimated total annual direct cost of corrosion in home appliances is at least $1.5 billion.\\n\\nGovernment. Federal, state, and local governments play important roles in the U.S. economy with a 1998 GDP of approximately $1.1 trillion ($360 billion federal. $745 billion state and local). While the government owns and operates large assets under various departments, the US. Department of Defense (DOD) was selected for analysis because of its significant impact on the U.S. economy. A second government sectors elected is nuclear waste storage under the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).\\n\\nDefense: The ability of the DOD to respond rapidly to national security and foreign commitments can be adversely affected by corrosion. Corrosion of military equipment and facilities has been. for many years, a significant and ongoing problem. The corrosion-related problems are becoming more prominent as the acquisition of new equipment is decreasing and a large degree of reliability of aging systems is expected. The data provided by the military services (Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) indicate that corrosion is potentially the number one cost driver in life-cycle costs. The total annual direct cost of corrosion incurred by the military services for both systems and infrastructure was estimated at $20 billion.\\n\\nA considerable portion of the cost of corrosion to the Army is attributed to ground vehicles, including tank systems, fighting vehicle systems, fire support systems, high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles (HMMWV), and light armored vehicles. Other systems that are affected by corrosion include fring platforms and helicopters. Many of the Army systems are well beyond their design service lives and because of generally aggressive operating environments, corrosion is becoming increasingly severe and costly. While often replacement of the aging systems is not budgeted, insufficient use is being made of existing technology to maintain these systems in a cost-effective manner. Even with the procurement of new equipment such as the HMMWV, the use of corrosion-resistant materials and design are often neglected in favor of quantity of procurement and system properties. In recent years, the Air Force has experienced considerable corrosion problems. As with the commercial aircraft industry, corrosion on airframes in the past has not been considered to have a significant impact on structural integrity; therefore, a “find and fix” approach has long been the preferred way to deal with corrosion in aircraft. With no significant hiding available for new system acquisition, the Air Force is forced to extend the operational life of many of the aircraft, such as the KC-135 tanker, far beyond their design service life\\n\\nNuclear Waste Storage: Nuclear wastes are generated from spent nuclear fuel, dismantled nuclear weapons, and products such as radio pharmaceuticals. The most important design item for the safe storage of nuclear waste is effective shielding of radiation. Corrosion is not considered a major issue in the transportation of nuclear wastes due to the stringent packaging requirements and the relatively short duration of the transport. However, corrosion is an important issue in the design of the casks used for permanent storage with a design life of several thousand years. A 1998 total life-cycle cost analysis by DOE for the permanent disposal of nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain, Nevada, estimated the total repository cost by the construction phase (2002) at $3.9 billion, with an average annual cost (from 1999 to 21 16) of 920.5 million. Of this cost, S42.2 million is corrosion-related.\\n\\nNACE has a powerpoint of the 2002 study: http://www.nace.org/Publications/Cost-of-Corrosion-Study/\\n\\n[ About this report: done from1999 to 2001 by CC Technologies Laboratories, Inc., with support from the FHWA and NACE. Its main activities included determining the cost of corrosion control methods and services, determining the economic impact of corrosion for specific industry sectors, extrapolating individual sector costs to a national total corrosion cost, assessing barriers to effective implementation of optimized corrosion control practices, and developing implementation strategies and cost-saving recommendations. ]\\n\\nPlease follow and like us:',\n",
       " \"From The Leftovers and Westworld to The Americans, here are the biggest surprises from the Emmy nominations, both horrific and happily unexpected\\n\\nWhere the hell is The Leftovers?\\n\\nThat’s question number one, following today’s announcement of the 69th Emmy nominations. Aside from a cursory nod for Ann Dowd in the guest actress in a drama series category, The Leftovers – perhaps the most critically adored television series of the year so far – failed to receive a single meaningful nomination. Carrie Coon fans will be sated by her lead actress nod for Fargo, the lesser of her two roles this year, although its exclusion still feels like an almighty slap in the face.\\n\\nWestworld leads the way with 22 Emmy nominations Read more\\n\\nTaking The Leftovers’ rightful place in the best drama series category is House of Cards, which just about managed to belch out yet another underwhelming season earlier this year. The only comfort from that inclusion is how unlikely it is to actually win, given the stiff competition. The Crown is more sumptuous, The Handmaid’s Tale more necessary. Stranger Things was more fun, Better Call Saul hit brand-new heights and, as a network series that people actually like, This is Us finds itself in the slightly ridiculous position of plucky underdog.\\n\\nAnd then there’s Westworld. Its success was probably to be taken slightly for granted – it’s the most self-consciously prestigious prestige drama of the year, plus the most overtly Games of Thronesy thing in a GoT-ineligible year – but did it deserve the giant haul of nominations it received? Based on the actual show itself, it did not.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Did Westworld deserve the giant haul of nominations it received? It did not. Photograph: John P Johnson/HBO\\n\\nAs for Better Call Saul – and not to do down Jonathan Banks, who received a supporting actor nomination – it is a tragedy that Michael McKean wasn’t recognised. His knotty, stubborn, complicated portrayal of Chuck McGill wasn’t just a career-best performance for him, it was one of the best performances by anyone in TV all year. Banks said about six words the entire series, but McKean built up and destroyed an entire life. The fact that he won’t be able to compete in next year’s awards makes the snub sting even more.\\n\\nEmmys 2017: the full list of nominees Read more\\n\\nIn fairness, these aside, most of this year’s Emmy shocks were happy ones. The Americans finally secured the recognition it deserved in the form of nods for both Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys, plus an outstanding writing nomination and a best guest actress nomination for Alison Wright’s poor, sweet, tragic stupid Martha. And Zach Galifianakis received a lead actor nomination for Baskets, a show many had written off as too weird and underwatched to count. He won’t win – and nor will fellow welcome nominee Donald Glover – because Jeffrey Tambor was nominated, and Transparent still apparently scrapes by as a comedy on some sort of technicality. Pamela Adlon won’t win the comedy lead actress Emmy for Better Things either, but her inclusion is just as sweetly unexpected.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A welcome nominee … Donald Glover in Atlanta with Lakeith Stanfield and Brian Tyree Henry. Photograph: Guy D'Alema/AP\\n\\nMillie Bobby Brown’s inclusion in best supporting drama actress isn’t only a nice touch – her appearance on the night will automatically ramp up the red carpet’s fun factor by about 500% – but it also gives her a genuine shot at the statue. Her role in Stranger Things, which unusually for that show didn’t require either a constant stream of nostalgic references or endless howling, was perhaps the hardest of them all. If the voters can see past her age, and ignore the showier one-note misery of her competitors, she’s in with a shout.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Millie Bobby Brown’s inclusion is a nice touch – plus her appearance on the night will automatically ramp up the red carpet’s fun factor by about 500%. Photograph: PF1/Netflix\\n\\nThe two shows that potentially have most to gain from these nominations, though, are Feud and Big Little Lies. This isn’t really much of a surprise. They’re both tremendous programmes, although you can’t help feeling the odds were always stacked in their favour. Big Little Lies was stuffed to the gills with big-name Hollywood stars, and Feud was a story about – you guessed it – big-name Hollywood stars. If there’s one faithful trope the Emmys will cling to for dear life, it’s that the clutch of nobodies who work on television will always become awestruck when a movie star enters the fray. You could argue that it’s unfair to the many, many deserving television-specific artists working today, but that’s the Emmys. Plus, Jimmy Fallon didn’t get anything, so it isn’t all bad.\\n\\nMainly, though, today’s nominations were all about The Leftovers. It was a funny, tender, beautiful show and it deserved far better than it received. Its sudden departure today will not be forgotten. We are living reminders.\",\n",
       " \"By Coleman Larned (@thesoccerswell)\\n\\nMLS will not be a top league until its coaches find better ways to connect projection metrics to tactical changes. Ben Olsen is showing he may be on the right track. The more data that is collected on variables such as game variability, individual player contributions and spatial frequency, the more information there is to digest and to affect playing, teaching and coaching. Therefore the issue lies in the translation of such data into meaningful, impactful resolutions that can be measured by on-field progress.\\n\\nThere's an opportunity for both sides of the analytical coin to learn and communicate more effectively. Can large data aggregation along with sound, statistics application give insight into the complexities of soccer from a perspective lost from the naked eye? Can tangible trials and consistent experiences within the sport mold the direction in which data is aggregated?\\n\\nIn this piece we'll take a look at the recent seasons of DC United and how they've usually outperformed our xG projections in order to better understand this disconnect.

Tom Brower announced Thursday that he’s pressing charges against the homeless teens who allegedly attacked him last month in Kakaako.\\n\\nBrower, known for once taking a sledgehammer to 30 shopping carts used by homeless people, made his announcement at the corner of Ohe and Olomehani streets — the site where he got into an altercation June 29 and was taken to an emergency room with a head injury, bruised ribs and a laceration above his right eye.\\n\\n“We have seen an escalation in the number of assaults in the area, and those who commit these acts need to be held accountable for their actions,” Brower told the reporters.\\n\\nCory Lum/Civil Beat\\n\\nSince the altercation, Brower has been maintaining that he was attacked without provocation.

       " 'On Monday, the Real Clear Politics site declared that Texas is up for grabs in the presidential election. The shift comes after a series of polls showing a tight race in the state between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and makes for a dramatic image on the site’s election tracking map, where Texas is no longer colored its usual red but is now the dark gray that connotes a “toss up.” For Democrats, seeing their state change color on one of the most widely read and respected campaign outlets—after decades of Republican dominance and years of unfulfilled hopes that Texas might turn blue—must be cathartic. And it might be tempting to view this sudden shift to competitiveness as the start of Democrats’ long-hoped-for return to relevance, as a turning point.\\n\\nWell, they should keep the cork in the champagne, because Texas remains a Republican state.\\n\\nAs my colleague R.G. Ratcliffe pointed out , the Texas polls are close not because of a huge spike in Democratic voters—Clinton’s numbers are roughly in line with Obama’s totals from 2008 and 2012—but because Trump’s support has cratered. He’s drastically under-performing previous Republican presidential nominees. John McCain and Mitt Romney garnered 55 percent and 57 percent of the vote in Texas, respectively. Trump is polling 10 to 12 points below that.\\n\\nThat isn’t just a Texas phenomenon: Other reliably Republican states like Utah, Arizona, and Georgia have also become competitive, and swing states like Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Colorado now appear out of reach for Trump.\\n\\nAll of which makes the close race in Texas look like a fluke—the product of a weak Republican candidate running a disastrous campaign.\\n\\nMany Democrats may already know this, but for anyone tempted to misread this election as a sign that something is fundamentally shifting in Texas politics, let’s run through a few more reasons why this close race is likely fool’s gold.\\n\\nFor one, it was possible to predict that Trump’s nomination could make Texas competitive in the presidential election; in fact, our own Erica Grieder called it months ago.\\n\\nIt’s also telling that the state became a toss up only after Trump’s campaign began to meltdown from scandals probably too numerous to list here. You’ve no doubt read a story or two about them.\\n\\nThat seems to indicate that the free-falling Trump campaign has made Texas a close race rather than any particular action taken by Democrats (Clinton’s recent small television ad buy not withstanding).\\n\\nWhile it’s true that the national GOP looks like a smoking ruin right now, the state party remains fairly strong. It still has huge advantages over Texas Democrats in money, organization, and candidate depth, and Republicans start every statewide race with at least a ten-point edge, if not more. And if you’re thinking that built-in advantage may be shrinking, keep in mind that we’re just two years removed from an across-the-board Republican blowout of nearly 20 points. In Wendy Davis, the Democrats had their best known and best funded candidate in years, and she lost to Greg Abbott by nearly a million votes.\\n\\nIt’s also worth remembering that most statewide offices in Texas come up for election in non-presidential years in which the electorate generally tends to be whiter and older—in other words, more Republican.\\n\\nThe one caveat is the potential increase in Latino voters. R.G. wrote on Monday that more than 530,000 people with Latino surnames have registered to vote since 2012, according to the Texas secretary of state’s office. It’s not hard to envision Trump’s candidacy increasing the number of Latino voters who turn out to vote in Texas, offering Democrats the opportunity to begin building a coalition that could one day make them competitive again. But capitalizing on that opportunity requires the difficult party-building, community-organizing, voter-turnout work that Democrats in this state haven’t exactly excelled at in recent years.\\n\\nIn other words, two years from now—without Trump at the top of the ticket—Texas Republicans will once again be heavily favored to sweep the statewide offices.\\n\\nSo Texas Democrats should enjoy the moment. They should have a long, satisfied look at that Real Clear Politics map, maybe take a screen shot of it, because it’s not likely to last.',\n",

       " 'OTTAWA -- In candid testimony before Parliament Tuesday, John Manley and Derek Burney, members of the independent panel on Afghanistan, said progress there has been hampered by what Mr. Manley called the American “folly” in Iraq.\\n\\nBut Mr. Burney, a former Canadian ambassador to Washington, said that with all the U.S. presidential candidates viewing Afghanistan as the “good war,” the United States can be re-engaged to make a difference on the ground there.\\n\\nOn the eve of a parliamentary vote on Canada’s future in the war-torn country, Mr. Manley warned that the international commitment to Afghanistan has been inadequate and that unless NATO comes up with more troops and equipment, “Afghanistan could be lost -- again.”\\n\\nMr. Manley, the former Liberal cabinet minister, and MR. Burney were testifying before the Commons foreign affairs committee, days before the House of Commons votes on extending the military mission to 2011.\\n\\nThe key recommendations of Manley’s panel have been adopted by the Stephen Harper government. The prime minister has told NATO and its partners in the International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, that Canadian troops would withdraw its troops from Afghanistan next February if the alliance cannot find an additional 1,000 combat troops in the south. Canada has also committed itself to finding transport helicopters to minimize the risks to soldiers from roadside bombs.\\n\\n“We’re trying to highlight for the other countries in ISAF, which is more than NATO, that this is not going well. And it requires a greater commitment,” Mr. Manley told the all-party committee of MPs.\\n\\nMr. Manley said the Taliban was able to take its time and regroup after being driven from power in late 2001.\\n\\n“They waited until the attention of the international community, particularly the West, was distracted by what I’d call the folly in Iraq,” Mr. Manley said. “Before we knew it, we had an all out insurgency on our hands partly because of neglect.”\\n\\nMr. Burney echoed MR. Manley’s assessment of the impact of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. “There’s no question that the commitment in Afghanistan has been distracted by events in Iraq, by the No. 1 player in the military mission and the civilian mission.”\\n\\nBut Mr. Burney added that it is encouraging that, “in the eyes of the aspirants for the presidency in the United States today, from either party, this is the good war.”\\n\\n“It seems to me that some of the distraction of NATO and the reluctance of NATO is a bit of a reflection of the distraction in Washington about the priority Afghanistan has had. I don’t think that that’s going to be a problem going forward.”\\n\\nThe chief of the Dutch military said Tuesday he is confident that Canada will receive the extra troops and equipment it needs to remain in southern Afghanistan.\\n\\nGen. D.L. (Dick) Berlijn said he is also hopeful that Parliament will, as expected, vote later this week to extend to 2011 the Canadian Forces’ participation in the Afghan war.\\n\\nGen. Berlijn said it would be “a very bad turn of events if Canada would leave” Kandahar when the current commitment expires next February.',\n",

       " \"Zipper, the functional cursor into a data structure, is itself a data structure, derived from the original one. The derived data type D' for the recursive data type D is D with exactly one hole. Filling-in the hole -- integrating over all positions of the hole -- gives the data type D back. Zipper is the derivative, pretty much in the calculus sense, of a data type. The zipper-as-datatype view was the original presentation, described by Huet (JFP, 1997) and Hinze and Jeuring (JFP 2001); the data structure derivative was expounded by McBride.\\n\\nWe advocate a different view, emphasizing not the result of navigating through a data structure to a desired item and extracting it, but the process of navigation. Each data structure comes with a method to enumerate its components, representing the data structure as a stream of the nodes visited during the enumeration. To let the user focus on a item and submit an update, the enumeration process should yield control to the user once it reached an item. Co-routines provide exactly the right yielding mechanism. As Chung-chieh Shan aptly put it, ``zipper is a suspended walk.''\\n\\nWhereas datatype-derivative zipper necessarily depends on the data type (different data types have different derivatives), the suspended-walk zipper is datatype-invariant. We only need a traversal procedure that applies a given function to each item of the data structure. The zipper is obtained by supplying the mapping function that yield s. Since the traversal procedure can generically handle many data types (think of map ), so can the zipper. Our zipper type depends only on the interface of the traversal function.\\n\\nThe two views of zipper are dual: they both regard zipper as the context of a data structure traversal. That context can be rendered in the functional form (the suspension, the delimited continuation of a traversal) or in the defunctionalized form, as a data structure.\",\n",
       " '\\n\\nAmmon Bundy, center, one of the sons of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, walks off after speaking with reporters during a news conference at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters on Jan. 4 near Burns, Ore. (Rick Bowmer/AP)\\n\\nCapt. Moroni is “the military stud muffin” of Mormon scripture, says one U.S. religious history expert. It’s also the moniker adopted by an armed man occupying a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon.\\n\\n[The FBI takes the lead in the Oregon standoff]\\n\\nThat’s because some supporters and members of the Bundy clan leading the occupation are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and have for years cited the Book of Mormon in their conflicts with the government and suggested that God blesses their actions.\\n\\nDuring the current standoff that began this weekend, one member of the occupiers told an Oregon reporter that his name is “Captain Moroni,” a warrior-hero in the Book of Mormon who faces off against an unfeeling government.\\n\\nAs Jana Riess, Mormon writer and U.S. religious history expert puts it: “People are drawn to the historical Captain Moroni because he’s the military studmuffin of the Book of Mormon; the character is brash and decisive, even ‘angry’… He gets the job done.” In an essay Monday, Riess writes that the captain’s story is a bit more complex in Mormon scripture, and in fact sometimes he’s wrong about who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.\\n\\nIt’s not clear how many people are involved in the standoff, which began Saturday. One member of the Bundy family told a reporter in Oregon that “150 militiamen” were there, but at least one person who saw them leave for the refuge said there were “maybe a dozen” people.\\n\\nIt’s also not clear how much empathy the occupiers have among Mormons, who mostly live in the West and are familiar with tensions over government power. The church’s early decades were marked with confrontation with and persecution from the U.S. government, a reason why Mormons headed West to begin with. These days, perhaps church officials’ highest priority is their concern that the government is infringing on the freedom of religious conservatives with liberalizing changes such as gay marriage and mandatory contraception coverage in health-care plans.\\n\\n[The Oregon occupiers’ land dispute, in 9 maps]\\n\\nReddit sites for Mormons and former Mormons were buzzing with mostly criticism for the armed occupiers. There was also some debate about the Mormon teaching that deifies the creation of the United States and the righteousness of the U.S. government, and whether the government had properly behaved in this case and thus merited Mormon devotion.\\n\\nOn Monday, the church confirmed that the Bundys are Mormon but said their actions are not sanctioned by the faith.\\n\\n“While the disagreement occurring in Oregon about the use of federal lands is not a Church matter, Church leaders strongly condemn the armed seizure of the facility and are deeply troubled by the reports that those who have seized the facility suggest that they are doing so based on scriptural principles. This armed occupation can in no way be justified on a scriptural basis. We are privileged to live in a nation where conflicts with government or private groups can — and should — be settled using peaceful means, according to the laws of the land,” the statement reads.\\n\\nThe church also released an excerpt from a 1992 talk by one of the top leaders, Elder Dallin H. Oaks, titled “Our Strengths Can Become Our Downfall.” Here’s the excerpt:\\n\\n“Love of country is surely a strength, but carried to excess it can become the cause of spiritual downfall. There are some citizens whose patriotism is so intense and so all-consuming that it seems to override every other responsibility, including family and Church. I caution those patriots who are participating in or provisioning private armies and making private preparations for armed conflict. Their excessive zeal for one aspect of patriotism is causing them to risk spiritual downfall as they withdraw from the society of the Church and from the governance of those civil authorities to whom our twelfth article of faith makes all of us subject.”\\n\\nThis weekend, a camouflage-wearing armed occupier said this when asked his name by Oregon Public Radio: “I’m Captain Moroni, from Utah.”\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t come here to shoot I came here to die.\"#bundymilitia, (will ID only as \"Capt.

No they couldn’t.”\\n\\nAnd: “If our (U.S.) Constitution is an inspired document by our Lord Jesus Christ, then isn’t it scripture?” Bundy asked the crowd. “Yes,” a chorus of voices replied. “Isn’t it the same as the Book of Mormon and the Bible?” Bundy asked. “Absolutely,” the audience answered.\\n\\nIn her essay critical of the Oregon occupiers, Riess said, “There are times and places in history when Latter-day Saints have a moral duty to oppose oppressive regimes.

       " 'GOP again blocks Wall Street reform debate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWASHINGTON (CNNMoney.com) -- Senate Democrats failed Tuesday - for the second time in two days - to muster the 60 votes needed to start debating Wall Street reform.\\n\\nThe official vote was 57-41 in favor of moving forward with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., switching his vote from \"yes\" to \"no,\" in a procedural move that allows him, under the Senate rules, to bring the bill up again as early as Wednesday for another vote.\\n\\nReid accused Republicans of preferring to work \"behind closed doors, instead of on the floor of the Senate in full view of the public,\" he said in a statement.\\n\\nSen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., again joined 39 Republicans to vote against the proposal to officially start debating the Wall Street reform legislation before other lawmakers on a Senate Banking panel negotiate a deal. Two Republicans did not vote.\\n\\n\"We think this is the best way to get a better bill,\" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., explaining why his caucus has united to block the bill\\'s movement for two days.\\n\\nDemocrats and Republicans still disagree about the way to go about preventing future bailouts, cracking down on risky bets and ensuring consumers have stronger protection.\\n\\nSen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., have been negotiating differences on the bill but have yet to come up with a final compromise.\\n\\nSeveral GOP moderates, including Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told CNN they don\\'t consider themselves blocking regulatory reforms - and they don\\'t feel pressured to vote to start the debate before a deal is negotiated.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not just simply blocking it for the sake of blocking it,\" said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. \"Rather than just insisting on votes, why not be working -- like they did on derivatives through the weekend -- on the question of the other aspects of the bill that raise legitimate questions?\"\\n\\nOne Democratic \\'No\\'\\n\\nNelson told CNN that he worried about the legislation\\'s impact on Main Street and that he didn\\'t want to push forward a bill that isn\\'t finalized.\\n\\nBut he also said he is opposed to the bill\\'s tough provisions cracking down on financial products called derivatives. He thinks that existing derivative contracts should be grandfathered in under weaker rules now in place that allow trades to be made in the dark.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a matter of constitutional correctness,\" Nelson said Tuesday. \"You can\\'t derogate a contract ... that\\'s in existence without it becoming a taking.\"\\n\\nThe investor Warren Buffett, who runs the firm Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), has been pushing for such a grandfather clause and his company is in Nebraska.\\n\\nBuffett is credited with coining the phrase \"financial weapons of mass destruction\" in describing derivatives, which is often repeated by lawmakers calling for tougher rules.\\n\\nHold-ups?\\n\\nShelby said Tuesday that the \"biggest obstacle\" is how much power and scope a proposed consumer financial product regulator would have in regulating things like credit cards and mortgages.\\n\\n\"We made great progress on the strengthening what came out of the Banking Committee dealing with the too big to fail,\" Shelby said. \"They basically liked some of the recommendations that on a staff level we\\'ve worked on to strengthen that. \"\\n\\nHe said the two had made great progress resolving differences on the issue of unwinding financial firms and preventing them from getting too big to fail, but he didn\\'t detail how.\\n\\nShelby also said that another sticking point remains with regulating bets on complex financial contracts known as derivatives. Lawmakers want to make them more transparent, pushing them onto clearinghouses and exchanges. They also want those making bets to post collateral, backing up the bets.\\n\\nBut Democrats also want to force banks to spin off their swaps desk, or the parts that deal in making such risky bets.\\n\\nRepublicans think the Democrats\\' crackdown on derivatives goes too far and will harm businesses, such as airlines and farmers, who benefit from making such bets to shed the risk of swings in prices and interest rates. They say it will push the financial industry to make trades overseas.\\n\\nRepublican alternative\\n\\nRepublicans released a memo Tuesday outlining an alternative approach to a financial overhaul that shared many provisions of the Democrats\\' bill.\\n\\nA big difference is on the consumer regulator. The draft suggests Republicans prefer a panel consisting mostly of regulators to create new consumer protection rules. Republicans also want new rules cracking down on the government sponsored enterprises Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\\n\\nDuring his speech on the Senate floor, Dodd said that he could work with a lot of the things he saw in the Republican memo, except the rules for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Dodd said new rules are needed, but said that issue is too big and complex, and needs to be tackled on its own.\\n\\n-- CNN congressional producer Ted Barrett and correspondent Brianna Keillar contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'There\\'s been a rich debate in marine ecological circles about what happens to a key food source along rocky coastlines dominated by upwelling. The literature is filled with studies suggesting that the larvae of simple prey organisms such as barnacles and mussels hitch a ride on the coast-to-offshore currents typical of upwelling and are thus mostly absent in the coastal tidal zones.\\n\\nThat theory is getting a major challenge. In a paper in Ecological Monographs, Brown University marine ecologist Jon Witman and colleagues report that a key thread in the food web, the barnacle -- the popcorn of the sea -- flourishes in zones with vertical upwelling. Working at an expansive range of underwater sites in the Galapagos Islands, Witman and his team found that at two subtidal depths, barnacle larvae had latched onto rock walls, despite the vertical currents. In fact, the swifter the vertical current, the more likely the barnacles would colonize a rocky surface, the team found.\\n\\nThe finding \"is counter to the prevailing notion about how marine communities are influenced by upwelling,\" said Witman, professor of biology in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.\\n\\nBarnacle communities thrived in the vertical-current sites, the team also found. The group routinely found specimens that had grown from one field season to the next to 3 centimeters (about 1 inch) in diameter -- \"big enough to make soup out of,\" Witman said. The researchers also documented the presence of whelks and hogfish, which feast on barnacles. This predator-prey relationship shows that vertical upwelling zones are \"much more dynamic ecosystems in terms of marine organisms than previously believed,\" Witman said.\\n\\nProfessor of Biology Witman and his team, including Brown graduate student Margarita Brandt and Franz Smith of CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research in Australia, chose a dozen sites of underwater cliffs, ledges and slopes along a 125-kilometer-long transect in the Galapagos. During three field seasons, the team bolted nearly 1,500 plates at depths of 6 and 15 meters to track the colonization of barnacle larvae and the growth of populations in areas with weak, intermediate and strong vertical upwelling.\\n\\nThe team also documented for the first time the strength of currents at the sampling locations, which included a dozen islands or outcrops located in the center of the archipelago. In areas with the most vertical upwelling, the researchers found, the current moved at a brisk 0.6 meters (2 feet) per second; the weakest vertical currents were measured at 5 centimeters (0.2 feet) per second.\\n\\nScientists who study coastal marine communities had assumed that prey species such as barnacles and mussels would be largely absent in vertical upwelling areas, since the larvae, which float freely in the water as they seek a surface to attach to, would more likely be swept away in the coast-to-offshore currents. Studies of the near-surface layer of the water in rocky tidal zones confirmed that thinking. But the field work by Witman and his group, in deeper water than previous studies, told a different tale: Few barnacles were found on the plates in the weak upwelling zones, while plates at the strong upwelling sites were teeming with the crustaceans. Flourishing barnacle communities were found at both the 6-meter and 15-meter stations, the researchers reported.\\n\\nThe scientists think the free-floating larvae thrive in the vertical-current zones because they are constantly being bounced against the rocky walls and eventually find a tranquil spot in micro crevices in the rock to latch on to. \"It\\'s a contact game,\" Witman said.\\n\\nThe team suggests the observations could hold true for other rocky tidal ecosystems. \"We\\'re one of the few people doing underwater experimental ecology in the Galapagos,\" said Brandt, who is Ecuadorean. \"This project is one of the first attempts to do that.\"\\n\\nThe National Science Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the private Banks Foundation funded the research.',\n",

       " 'Joey Davidson | PAX East 2016 Gaming Reviews & News Interview by I took some time at PAX East 2016 this past weekend to check out Overwatch running on a PlayStation 4. The game plays really well, and you can dig into my impressions of it on that format right here. After my hands-on session, I sat down with Assistant Game Director Aaron Keller and talked about a bunch of stuff as it relates to the game. I’ve transcribed that interview in its entirety. My questions are in bold, Aaron’s answers are in plain text. Check it out below this gallery.\\n\\ngallery 1 27 Advertisement\\n\\nDid you need to make any design changes in order to accommodate bringing Overwatch to consoles? We talked about it, it was something we anticipated while developing the game… Even early on, we wanted to develop this game for consoles. Most of the team had console controllers on their desks even though they were hooked up to PCs and we didn’t have a console build yet. We wanted it to feel as good as it could on the console, and I feel like we accomplished that. I think it plays really well and handles really smoothly on console, and it’s always locked at 60fps. We had anticipated that we’d need to make a lot of tuning changes, and we didn’t actually have to do that. Really? That’s sort of surprising… There are very small differences, and I don’t think we have any on the tuning side right now. There are differences like voice chat, you know, because the consoles handle that. We do have aim assist on consoles, so that’s probably the biggest difference between the versions for gameplay. How does this aim assist work? I don’t have all the details of it, but we actually worked really closely with Treyarch [one of the studios behind Call of Duty]. They gave us a lot of tips for it, and a lot of help with tuning on it. They were actually really helpful all around. Is that sort of an unexpected perk of being with Activision now? Yeah, we’ve collaborated with a lot of different studios. We worked with Treyarch for our game, the Destiny team [Bungie] has come down multiple times to talk to different people at Blizzard. It’s actually… you know, a lot of people look at Activision as this dispersed set of studios, but there’s actually a lot of collaboration between them. Did that surprise you? A little bit when it first happened; but, it’s actually been really refreshing and really nice to feel like your part of this broader set of kick-ass developers.\\n\\ngallery 1 13 Advertisement\\n\\nSo, it’s 21 characters right now, right? Yep. How did you arrive at that number? Was there a lot cut out… I mean, I’m sure there was… Yeah, it was pretty fluid at the start of development, you know, exactly how many heroes we wanted to have in the game. One of the things that was really important to us was that we have a variety of play styles, and a variety of play styles within each role. We have four different roles in the game: attack, defense, support and tank. We wanted a lot of people to be able to feel like they could pick this support instead of another because it better fits their play style. Sure. We wanted there to be a lot of different options and counters for people to select from over the course of a match. 21 is where we had it. The interesting thing that happened during development is that even when we had 17 or 18 heroes, we would add a new one in and it would totally change the way the game was played. Did that mean that you would have to go back and re-tune all 17 of the previous heroes? That could happen, but some of it was almost just that the meta of the game would change because this new hero was there. There were new things that you would have to think about as you played the game. Does that sort of meta game change make it harder to decide on stuff like character DLC after launch? Yes and no. The game sort of reacts a little differently to each hero you throw at it. It’s always, from our point of few, become more interesting and more exciting each time we’ve done it. It’s always this refreshing thing that happens; the new heroes are there, and you’re thinking about everything. Whether it’s on a specific map or how your team should handle strategy, you’re thinking about everything in new and different ways. We have already talked about it. We will be adding new heroes to the game, and we will be adding new maps to the game. That stuff is coming.\\n\\ngallery 1 23 Advertisement',\n",
       " 'Neil deGrasse Tyson may well be America’s most prominent scientist. He is the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, and a research associate in the Department of Astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History, both in New York. He was the host for Fox’s “Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey” and PBS’s “NOVA ScienceNow.” He is a prominent lecturer and public intellectual, and may be more well known than Bill Nye, the Science Guy. He is a noted authority on science and current affairs — and yet, according to at least one critic, he may have a habit of making up some of the tales he tells in his speeches. In a series of articles for The Federalist, a right-leaning Web magazine, Sean Davis makes a strong case that Tyson has a habit of telling tall tales. The details of one personal story — what happened when Tyson was called for jury duty — vary with each telling. Other tales, such as quotes attributed to members of Congress and unnamed journalists, seem too good to be true, and prove difficult to verify. Most significantly, Tyson attributes a quote to a September 2001 speech by former President George W. Bush that no one can seem to find. Here’s Davis:\\n\\nAccording to Tyson, in the days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Bush uttered the phrase, “Our God is the God who named the stars.” According to Tyson, the president made that claim as a way of segregating radical Islam from religions like Christianity or Judaism. TYSON: Here’s what happens. George Bush, within a week of [the 9/11 terrorist attacks] gave us a speech attempting to distinguish we from they. And who are they? These were sort of the Muslim fundamentalists. And he wants to distinguish we from they. And how does he do it?\\n\\nHe says, “Our God” — of course it’s actually the same God, but that’s a detail, let’s hold that minor fact aside for the moment. Allah of the Muslims is the same God as the God of the Old Testament. So, but let’s hold that aside. He says, “Our God is the God” — he’s loosely quoting Genesis, biblical Genesis — “Our God is the God who named the stars.” [Link to video] Neil deGrasse Tyson’s story has three central claims: 1) Bush uttered that precise phrase, 2) in the days immediately after 9/11, 3) in order to distance American religion from that practiced by radical Muslims. As you have probably already guessed, every single claim is false. Every one! Then there’s Tyson’s aside that Bush’s quote was a “loose quote” of the book of Genesis. Yep, that’s false, too.\\n\\nDavis could not find any account of Bush having said anything remotely resembling the quote in the days following 9/11, and Bush’s speechwriters deny this is something the president said. I checked the WhiteHouse.gov archive of Bush speeches, too, and it’s not there. (There is, however, a short speech on Islam as a religion of peace, which takes a very different tack than that which Tyson suggests.) The closest thing Davis could find to the quote Tyson attributes to Bush is from remarks the president gave in 2003.\\n\\nThe only similar quote came in February of 2003 after the crash of the space shuttle Columbia, when the president said, “The same Creator who names the stars also knows the names of the seven souls we mourn today.” However, contrary to what Tyson has repeatedly claimed, the Columbia space shuttle comment — which was wholly different in purpose, content, and timing than the alleged 9/11 quote cited by Tyson — was meant to unite the nation following a horrible tragedy, not divide it based on religion. And contrary to Tyson’s claim that the alleged quote was loosely taken from Genesis, the actual quote was taken from the book of Isaiah. A similar verse can also be found in Psalm 147.\\n\\nNote that the claims Davis contests are not casual remarks in conversation or responses to questions, but planned and repeated accounts. The various stories Davis challenges are regularly repeated in Tyson’s lectures, and the Bush anecdote is highlighted on the Hayden planetarium Web site. They are the sorts of claims someone of Tyson’s stature should not be making in public lectures unless they are, in fact, true. Politicians are routinely flayed for less — and we know Tyson is much smarter than the average politician. He should not be held to a lower standard. It is possible that all of the claims Tyson has made are accurate (save for all the variations of his jury duty tale). The various quotes, including that by Bush, may well exist. If so, I would think Tyson can provide citations. If not, Tyson should acknowledge his errors. If the quotes are verified, by Tyson or someone else, I will update this post accordingly. I will also post any response I receive from Tyson, and link to any response from him published elsewhere. Tyson’s agent had no response to this Daily Beast story, though a representative of the Hayden Planetarium apparently verified the Tyson comment referenced here.\\n\\n[Note: Fixed a typo above – 2001 not 2011]\\n\\nUPDATE: On his Facebook page, Neil deGrasse Tyson responds to the allegations and, in the process, did not do himself any favors. On the alleged bush quote, he initially insists it was based upon his own memory:\\n\\nI have explicit memory of those words being spoken by the President. I reacted on the spot, making note for possible later reference in my public discourse. Odd that nobody seems to be able to find the quote anywhere — surely every word publicly uttered by a President gets logged. FYI: There are two kinds of failures of memory. One is remembering that which has never happened and the other is forgetting that which did. In my case, from life experience, I’m vastly more likely to forget an incident than to remember an incident that never happened. So I assure you, the quote is there somewhere. When you find it, tell me. Then I can offer it to others who have taken as much time as you to explore these things. One of our mantras in science is that the absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence.\\n\\nSo, initially, Tyson insisted that he was correct in his account of what Bush said and the context in which Bush said it.\\n\\nThen, in response to comments, Tyson confesses that he must have made an error.\\n\\nGood to see that the Bush quote was found. Thanks to all who did the searching. I transposed one disaster with another (both occurring within 18 months of one another) in my assigning his quote. Perhaps that’s a measure of how upset I was in both cases. The mind is surely the next mysterious universe to be plumbed.\\n\\nWhat is really so “mysterious” is why Tyson finds it so difficult to confess error and pretends that bush’s 2003 remarks were only just-now discovered. As noted above, Sean Davis had pointed to this quote as a potential source from the beginning. Yet if this is the source of the quote, then nearly everything else Tyson claimed about it and its significance is false (as is his initial account of the source of the quote).\\n\\nTyson claims to be a man of science who follows the evidence where it leads. The evidence here clearly shows Tyson screwed up. Whether knowingly or not, he regularly repeated a false account in order to cast aspersions on another public figure. The only proper thing to do is recant and apologize.\\n\\nP.S. I am sure some of Tyson’s political adversaries would like to use this episode as a basis for attacking climate science or evolution. No dice. It does not work that way. That Tyson told tall tales here tells us nothing about these other matters.',\n",
       " \"Ghost Psychology\\n\\nPacman contents\\n\\nGhost personalities\\n\\nGhost modes\\n\\nEvidence of forward thinking\\n\\nghost personalities\\n\\nI don't have any problem with any of the ghosts. Remember, I'm perfect.\\n\\n-- Billy Mitchell, world Pac-Man champion\\n\\nShadow / Blinky\\n\\nBlinky begins each level moving at the same speed as all of the other ghosts, but after you've eaten a certain number of dots, he begins to speed up. It is customary to refer to this change as the point when he takes on the identity of 'Cruise Elroy'. Blinky becomes Cruise Elroy earlier and earlier as you progress to higher and higher levels as illustrated in the following table.\\n\\nLEVEL ACCELERATES WHEN DOTS REMAINING IS EQUAL TO... 1 20 2 30 3 40 4 40 5 40 6 50 7 50 8 50 9 60 10 60 11+ unknown\\n\\nUnlike the other ghosts, Blinky will also tend to follow close on your tail even when you turn and will often still chase you even in scatter mode.\\n\\nSpeedy / Pinky\\n\\nPinky, Inky and Clyde always move at the same speed relative to one another so the name Speedy is plainly misleading. However, the name may have been earned by the fact that Pinky is almost always the first of the ghosts to reverse direction when going in and out of scatter mode.\\n\\nPinky seems to have a tendency to go around blocks in an anticlockwise direction unlike Blinky and Clyde who seem to prefer going clockwise. This means that if Blinky and Pinky reach the opposite side of a block to where you are, they'll come at you from opposite sides of it. They can often trap you like this so be careful of this deadly duo.\\n\\nBashful / Inky\\n\\nInky is dangerous because he's unpredictable. Given the same choices, he will often take different turns at different times. There might be rhyme and reason to his behaviour, but we haven't recognised it yet. One theory is that Inky's behaviour depends on his proximity to Blinky almost as if he is too afraid to act on his own (like some people who never go to a cinema by themselves). Another unconfirmed theory about Inky is that he will often turn off if Pac-Man charges him. These theories might have emerged as a result Inky's nickname (Bashful), the same kind of reasoning that has lead many authorities to believe erroneously that Pinky (aka Speedy) is actually faster than the other ghosts. For this reason, we have decided to reserve our judgement until further evidence can be obtained.\\n\\nPokey / Clyde\\n\\nClyde is either short-sighted or stupid. He will often turn off rather than approach you. His heart doesn't seem to be in it at all. A consequence of Clyde's unwillingness to take part is that it's often hard to round all of the ghosts up into a single cluster which is nice to do just before eating a power pill.\\n\\nghost modes\\n\\nI felt it would be too stressful for a human being like Pac Man to be continually surrounded and hunted down. So I created the monsters' invasions to come in waves. They'd attack and then they'd retreat. As time went by they would regroup, attack, and disperse again. It seemed more natural than having constant attack.\\n\\n-- Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-Man\\n\\nEvery now and then all of the ghosts will simultaneously cease their pursuit of Pac-Man and head for their home corners. We call this scatter mode and contrast it with the ghosts' usual attack mode. Scatter mode means the ghosts will leave you alone for a while so it's a good opportunity to clean up those awkward areas of the screen. But be careful, the ghosts don't stay in scatter mode for long and will only enter it a maximum of four times on the one life and level (i.e. the count resets after losing a life or when a level is completed). It is particularly important to take advantage of scatters on levels where the ghosts don't turn blue at all after eating power pills.\\n\\nThe ghosts in their home corners\\n\\nThe moments when the ghosts change in and out of scatter mode are determined by a timer, not by the number of dots eaten and are marked by the ghosts all simultaneously reversing direction. At the beginning of a level or after losing a life, the ghosts emerge from the ghost-hut already in scatter mode. This and the second scatter are both 7 seconds long, but the third and fourth scatters are only 5 seconds each. The attack waves between scatter periods last for 20 seconds each. The mode sequence is summarised in the following table.\\n\\nMODE DURATION IN SECONDS scatter 7 attack 20 scatter 7 attack 20 scatter 5 attack 20 scatter 5 attack forever\\n\\nBe careful of the red ghost because he will sometimes still pursue you while in scatter mode. This may be related to the Cruise Elroy phenomenon.\\n\\nWhen Pac-Man eats a power pill, the ghosts enter blue mode. During this period, the scatter timer is paused. When ghosts leave blue mode, they return to whatever mode they were in when the power pill was eaten and the timer count continues. The ghosts move more slowly while in blue mode and decisions are not made in the same way they are in either scatter or attack modes. Note that all mode changes are marked by the ghosts reversing direction with the exception of when the ghosts leave blue mode. Note also that the ghosts don't actually all reverse at exactly the same time, but within a few time steps of one another.\\n\\nevidence of forward thinking\",\n",

If Fox didn’t talk about this, they would have nothing else to talk about, it seems to me.” Holder argued that referring to incidents of violence as “radical Islam” or “Islamic extremism” did not alter how the administration handled any particular case.\" What we have to do is defined not by the terms that we use, but by the facts on the ground,” he said. “So I don’t worry an awful lot about what the appropriate terminology ought to be. I think that people need to actually think about that, and think about will we be having this conversation about words as opposed to what our actions ought to be?

       " 'It sure looks like President Donald Trump is waging a deliberate public campaign to push his own attorney general to resign.\\n\\nIn a remarkable set of Tuesday morning tweets, Trump trashed Jeff Sessions as taking “a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes” and “intel leakers,” outright complaining that the Justice Department wasn’t doing enough to investigate his political opponents in a manner that shows a shocking lack of respect for the rule of law.\\n\\nUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign - \"quietly working to boost Clinton.\" So where is the investigation A.G. @seanhannity — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017\\n\\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017\\n\\nThis follows up a just-as-remarkable Monday morning tweet in which Trump called Sessions “beleaguered,” and also asked why he wasn’t looking into “crimes” supposedly committed by Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nSo why aren\\'t the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2017\\n\\nAnd this isn’t just venting. On Tuesday, the Washington Post’s Sari Horwitz, Matt Zapotosky, and Robert Costa reported that Trump and his advisers “are privately discussing the possibility of replacing” Sessions as “potentially” part of a strategy to shut down Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.\\n\\nIndeed, in an interview with the New York Times, Trump complained at length that Sessions shouldn’t have recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation. “It’s extremely unfair, and that’s a mild word, to the president,” Trump said.\\n\\nAll this might come as a surprise, considering that Sessions has long seemed to be Trumpism’s biggest champion and truest believer.\\n\\nBut it makes a whole lot more sense when you keep one thing in mind: A new attorney general would not be recused from overseeing the Russia investigation — and therefore might be able to put a lid on it.\\n\\nThis is something Trump has very clearly identified as his biggest problem with Sessions. Indeed, he’s said outright that if he’d known Sessions was going to recuse himself, he wouldn’t have chosen him in the first place. “If he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else,” the president told the Times.\\n\\nSo it seems pretty obvious that Trump’s top priority in searching for a replacement for Sessions will be finding someone who won’t recuse himself — and who would therefore be supervising Mueller’s investigation and ultimately deciding whether or not to file charges against anyone.\\n\\nAnd that means the Senate needs to demand that any replacement commits, in sworn testimony, to recusal.\\n\\nA new attorney general wouldn’t necessarily be recused\\n\\nTrump’s public negging of Sessions seems to make a whole lot more sense under the theory that he’s trying to replace an attorney general who recused himself with one who won’t.\\n\\nDespite the fact that Sessions was the very first member of the US Senate to endorse Trump’s campaign back in February 2016 and has long seemed to share Trump’s worldview on immigration, the president has reportedly been furious at him since early March, when the new attorney general recused himself from any campaign-related investigations.\\n\\nThe Washington Post’s Robert Costa reported that same weekend that Trump left for a weekend trip to Florida “in a fury ... fuming about Sessions’s recusal and telling aides that Sessions shouldn’t have recused himself.” And since then, it’s only gotten worse, especially after Sessions’s recusal opened the door for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint Robert Mueller as a special counsel overseeing the probe. Last month we heard that Sessions had at one point offered to resign (Trump refused), and now we have this new public dressing-down.\\n\\nTrump certainly seems to be acting like Mueller’s investigation may pose an existential threat to his presidency. For months now — both before Mueller’s appointment and afterward — the president has publicly and privately raged about the Russia probe. He admitted he fired FBI Director James Comey in part because of his handling of the Russia investigation. And now, he keeps complaining about Sessions’s recusal, in an apparent effort to force him out.\\n\\nThe generous interpretation here is that Trump legitimately thinks there’s nothing to the Russia scandal and that he, his family members, and his associates are being unfairly targeted in a “witch hunt.” However, it is also extremely possible that Trump suspects people close to him are in serious legal danger and wants his subordinates to try to bottle up the investigation.\\n\\nEither way, it’s obvious given Trump’s public statements that he sees Sessions’s recusal as one of the biggest problems dogging his presidency. And it certainly seems natural that he would try to solve that problem by replacing Sessions with a new attorney general who won’t recuse himself.\\n\\nThe Senate needs to refuse to confirm any replacement for Sessions who won’t recuse himself\\n\\nThe potential problem for Trump here is that any replacement for Sessions would have to be confirmed by the Senate, so he can’t just install a flunky and be done with it. Any new nominee will surely be asked under oath about whether he or she would recuse during confirmation hearings.\\n\\nBut there’s a serious risk here that a nominee with strong-on-paper credentials would skate through the hearing giving vague or noncommittal answers to this question — and then act to protect Trump once in office.\\n\\nIndeed, Rod Rosenstein gave vague answers to questions like these during his confirmation hearing as deputy attorney general in March. He repeatedly said that he didn’t have “access” to all the “facts” that would help him decide whether to recuse himself or appoint a special counsel in the matter of the Russia investigation, and vaguely promised that he’d do whatever the facts merited.\\n\\nSenate Democrats decided to give Rosenstein the benefit of the doubt, and he ended up being confirmed by an enormous 94-6 majority. But just weeks later, Rosenstein was tasked with writing a memo that would be the pretext for the president’s firing of FBI Director James Comey — and did it.\\n\\nAfter a week of intense public criticism, Rosenstein did end up appointing Robert Mueller as special counsel. However, Rosenstein hasn’t yet recused himself from oversight of the Mueller probe, even though the investigation is apparently looking into the events surrounding Comey’s firing.\\n\\nThe Senate shouldn’t take such vague assurances at face value again. Trump’s behavior all around the Russia scandal sure makes it seem like he’s covering up something, and he’s openly said he would have preferred an attorney general who didn’t recuse himself. And though Rosenstein in the end proved susceptible to public criticism, there’s no guarantee a new attorney general would.\\n\\nSo if Sessions does quit or is fired, senators need to demand that any new attorney general nominee sent up by Trump commits under oath to recuse himself or herself from the Russia investigation. If the Senate confirms anyone who has not made that sworn promise, they risk letting the president get away with a potential cover-up.',\n",

       " 'Riding your bike to work is a good way to reduce your carbon footprint. But how green is the place you ride your bike to?\\n\\nBuildings use an enormous amount of energy. According to a Department of Energy report, they accounted for 39 percent of primary energy consumption in the U.S. in 2010. Commercial buildings, such as office and retail space, used about 46 percent of that, for a total of about 19 percent overall.\\n\\nThe top three uses of all that energy are lighting, heating, and cooling. Much of this is wasted on running air conditioning in empty rooms, or heating spaces with old windows and bad insulation. California\\'s Title 24 energy efficiency regulations, all new non-residential buildings and some remodeled buildings will be required to meet certain standards, and many states are following suit with similar laws. But this still leaves millions of older buildings squandering power heating empty conference rooms with drafty windows.\\n\\n>\\'Facilities and real-estate people are the last on the budget. They only get money when something breaks.\\'\\n\\nThe irony is that investments in energy efficiency should pay for themselves in the long run by slashing utility bills. But the up-front costs are often a barrier, says Jesse Foote, an analyst at Navigant Research. \"A building manager might not be able to lay out capital for those sorts of upgrades, even if it has a fairly good payback period,\" he says. \"They might be capital constrained, or there might be rules about how money can be spent, or there might not be someone willing to stick their necks out and do it.\"\\n\\nJoe Costello, the CEO of a startup called Enlighted, puts it more bluntly. \"Facilities and real-estate people are the last on the budget,\" he says. \"They only get money when something breaks.\" But Enlighted wants to fix this problem.\\n\\nRuggedized Sensor. Enlighted\\n\\nThe Sunnyvale, California company builds devices that can detect heat, light, and motion, and it pairs them with a software system that can control lighting—and soon heating and cooling—based on the data these sensors collect. Costello calls Enlighted \"Nest for the commercial real estate world,\" referring to the internet of things company now owned by Google, but that\\'s only part of the pitch. The company also lets businesses use its technology without paying any up-front costs. Thanks to a clever financing model, customers only have to pay as much as the tech saves them each month.\\n\\nAccording to Foote, it\\'s a model used by many other companies trying to remake offices with more efficient lighting, heating, and cooling, including electronics giant Philips, and it could be just the thing that many businesses need to finally move their offices into a much greener place.\\n\\nSensors, Sensors Everywhere\\n\\nNo, environment sensors aren\\'t anything new. But Enlighted is part of a growing number of startups taking a new approach. Instead of placing motion sensors around an office and using a centralized server to make decisions at a per room level, Enlighted places sensors and controls on each light fixture, enabling a more fine-tuned control and more accurate sensor readings.\\n\\nTraditional, motion controlled automation systems are a good idea in theory, but as Costello tells it, they can lead to problems. If you\\'re sitting still at your desk, the system may switch of the lights if you don\\'t move around enough. Worse, false alarms can trigger the lights, leading to more waste.\\n\\nCostello says one of Enlighted\\'s potential customers installed a motion detecting system in its warehouse that couldn\\'t tell the difference between humans walking around the shop floor and boxes moving around on a conveyer belt, so it would leave the lights on when the machines were running, even if there were no people in the room. But this won\\'t happen with Enlighted. Because the company incorporates multiple types of sensors into its devices, it can, in theory, make more accurate analysis about whether a human is in a room or not.\\n\\nEnter the Mesh Network\\n\\nThe other trick is that these sensors are smart enough to think for themselves. Although the devices can be controlled remotely through a server, each one has an on-board processor that can make decisions independently without relying on direction from a central machine.\\n\\nThis might sound like a more expensive approach, but CTO and co-founder Tanuj Mohan explains that this actually cuts installation costs because the sensors share data through a wireless network and tap into the light fixture for power. That means you don\\'t need any new networking or electric cabling to support them.\\n\\nTanuj Mohan. Enlighted\\n\\nThe usual problem with this idea is that the sensor network would overload the network switches. But Mohan, who had worked on building networks at the wireless networking company Tropos, knew it was possible to work around this limitation by using an approach called mesh networking. In a mesh network, each node connects to one or more neighboring nodes, instead of directly to the central hub. That way the hub doesn\\'t get overloaded with connections from all the different devices.\\n\\nPaying It Forward\\n\\nEnlighted isn\\'t alone in bringing wireless multi-sensors to office lighting systems. Other companies such as CommScope, Daintree Networks and Digital Lumens are trying to do much the same thing. But the most exciting part of the company\\'s pitch is its business model.\\n\\nBefore installing a system at a customer\\'s office, Enlighted—not the customer—will take out loans based on how much the customer is expected to save with its sensor tech. Then customers merely pays Enlighted a percentage of the money the tech saves them each month–without paying anything up-front. And because Enlighted only takes a percentage of the savings, the customers still start seeing a cost improvement right away.\\n\\nOnce the payment period is over, the customer never pays another dime to Enlighted. That means the amount Enlighted ends up making depends on how much money its customers actually save. That provides extra incentive for Enlighted to make sure its products deliver on its promises, which are pretty bold. Customers still have the option of paying up-front, the old fashioned way, but the new way to pay can potentially bring the company\\'s tech to a much wider audience.\\n\\nBeyond Enlighted\\n\\nEnlighted hopes that its offering will extend well beyond lighting. By using multiple sensors, Enlighted can not only determine whether there\\'s a person in a room, but how many people. This can provide insights into which spaces are under or overused, or provide security information. Retailers can use it to monitor how people move through stores, or which parts of the store they spend time in.\\n\\nThe company is building its own heating and cooling automation system, but the platform is also designed to integrate with other building systems. That means other companies can build automation systems based on the data gathered by Enlighted.\\n\\nAt the same time, Enlighted could feed the wider market in other ways. Greening the office buildings of the world will mean a lot more than just installing office automation products. It will also mean replacing windows, installing solar panels, or integrating ways of recycling waste water. All of those things will cost money up front, but save money in the long-term. And the model Enlighted has embraced may make these technologies more available to building owners—or eventually even consumers—regardless of their budgets.',\n",

All in all the community can shoulder most of the 'what do we put in it' work and the development cost is just changing the loadouts in the code and reaping the data from the community (which is fairly light weight all things considered). In exchange for this time investment PGI gets a stronger new player experience, more reputable (C) mechs which encourage player retention since they do not feel unable to find a suitable mech with 'try before you buy', and more functional (C) mechs overall for all players.Further, with a semi-annual review/update if mechs are found to be just fine overall, they do not need to be considered for a particular update with a simple metric evaluation and community up/down vote.

And Saudi Arabia does not want to freeze its production if Iran is not a party to this initiative,\" Francis Perrin, the chairman of the French-based Energy Strategies and Policies (SPE) firm, told Sputnik.\\n\\nIran has been boosting its oil sales after a July 2015 deal with the P5+1 group of world powers, comprising Russia, the United States, China, France and the United Kingdom plus Germany, on monitoring and limiting Tehran\\'s nuclear program in exchange for the easing of international sanctions.\\n\\nLack of Spare Capacity\\n\\nThe slump has been driven by the ongoing glut in oil supply, with production standing at record levels. The total output by the OPEC member states amounted to 32.182 million barrels per day in December, over half a million in excess of its 31.5-million barrel production ceiling set on December 4. Output increased to 32.3 million barrels per day in January, according to the organization.\\n\\n\"The putative agreement meant nothing. Outside of Iran, major oil producers do not seem to have much excess capacity to increase production in significant amounts. Therefore a freeze agreement would have just been an agreement to not do what they couldn\\'t do [raise production],\" Perdue said.\\n\\nAccording to Perdue, as Iran consistently and strongly rejected all thoughts of a freeze on their production, \"in sum, the agreement would have been an agreement to do nothing different and was always obviously going to fail.\"\\n\\nNot Doha but Supply and Demand\\n\\n\"To us it’s more of a supply-and-demand issue rather than an agreement to freeze production. Hypothetically, in the event that oil prices dramatically dropped and there was an oil freeze agreement arranged out of desperation, the effect on the oil market, for the reasons stated above, would be temporary,\" Trends Research Institute\\'s Celente said.\\n\\nSPE Chairman Perrin noted that the good news for producers was that \"the oil price fall is rebalancing the oil market with a little more demand and a little less supply from non-OPEC countries in 2016.\"\\n\\n© AFP 2018 / OLYA MORVAN My Way or the Highway: Saudis Refuse to Work With Others, Blame Russia and Iran for Low Oil Prices\\n\\n\"These trends will support higher oil prices but producers could have contributed to the acceleration of this trend and they missed a good opportunity to do that,\" Perrin said.\\n\\nPerdue also noted that the only thing that would get the market to balance over time was the supply and demand issue.\\n\\n\"The fall in supply from free-market producers (primarily North American Shale) and demand growth over time will be what gets the market to balance if anything,\" Perdue said.\\n\\nThe failure in Doha triggered a sharp drop of about 4 percent in oil prices. However, there was a significant rebound afterwards with Brent crude oil trading above $44 per barrel on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"While it will put downward pressure on oil prices, possibly pushing them back to their recent lows, we still maintain our forecast that in the absence of strong global economic growth, crude will fluctuate between the high $20\\'s to mid $40-range,\" Celente said commenting on the impact of the failure in Doha on the oil market.\\n\\nThe global prices on oil plunged from $115 to less than $30 per barrel between June 2014 and January 2016, hitting their lowest levels since 2003 amid the ongoing glut in global oil supply.',\n",

       " 'The 45-storey skyscraper that the Venezuelan entrepreneur David Brillembourg began building in the booming financial centre of Caracas of the early 1990s never did become the emblem of abundance its late owner intended it to be. A banking crisis truncated his dream.\\n\\nBut 20 years later, the incomplete Torre Confinanzas, or Torre de David (Tower of David) as it most widely known, with its staircases that lead nowhere and ramps that spiral into infinity is experiencing something of a renaissance – not as a home for a prosperous bank, but 2,500 squatters.\\n\\nThe squat, thought to be the tallest anywhere in the world, is an eyesore for President Hugo Chávez and his supporters, a reminder that basic housing for millions is a problem in their oil-rich country: 51% of the population lives in precarious shantytowns with no access to basic services. In the capital city alone, there is a shortage of almost 400,000 houses. With little access to loans, and a permissive attitude from the Chavista government towards land invasions and illegal takeovers, squatting has become one of the few housing options people have.\\n\\nThe takeover of Torre de David began four years ago when 300 people forced their way into the derelict building. \"The night we came in, I was scared, but I was also excited to finally have my own home,\" says Jhonny Jimenez, 31, a member of the founding group and now one of the tower\\'s main co-ordinators. \"We organised people according to their needs: the elderly who can\\'t go up flights of stairs would go in the lower floors and large families would get more space.\"\\n\\nTorre de David still lacks basic services, but the building functions well. Each of the 22 inhabited floors has co-ordinators, like Jimenez, who oversee the general functioning of their assigned area.\\n\\nThe management of the building is divided into three departments: health services, recreation and security. Space is granted free, but people pay a monthly fee of 150 Bolívar fuerte (£13) for improvements such as a recreation room for children and an evangelical church being built on the ground floor.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a city within a city, with corner shops on every other floor, cybercafes and apartments that double as hair salons and other types of informal businesses,\" says Leo Alvarez, a lawyer who has documented these informal settlements. \"It functions, and quite well, with no authority other than their pastor.\"\\n\\nAlexander Daza, or el Niño, is the evangelical pastor and the leader of the community, a label he resists. \"I\\'ve done all sorts of work here from carrying sacks of cement to changing lightbulbs. I gained people\\'s respect through example, like Jesus, like Che [Guevara].\" he says. \"We have legalised everything. Nobody has tried to evict us. On the contrary, [government officials] are in favour of us.\"\\n\\nThe future of Torre de David remains a contentious issue. Critics think it would be more profitable to restore the building to its intended use. \"With the money from office spaces like that you could pay for houses that did have proper services for all the people that live there and more,\" says José Alejandro Santana, a professor of architecture at Venezuela\\'s Central University.\\n\\nMike Davis, urban theorist and author of Planet of Slums, thinks Torre de David \"is testimony to the acute housing shortage in Caracas, a problem, like crime, that has vexed the Chávez government. Despite official rhetoric, the Bolivarianist regime has undertaken no serious redistribution of wealth in the cities and oil revenues pay for too many other programmes and subsidies to leave room for new housing construction.\"\\n\\nHe says the building has great potential: \"What interests me more about Torre de David is its emergent ecology with small businesses, jerry-rigged services; it makes it an obvious candidate for a \\'green skyscraper\\' experiment.\"\\n\\nTorre de David is far from the perfect home. No sewage system is in place, lorry-delivered water is rationed, whole sections of the building are in the dark and the absence of lifts forces people to walk up hundreds of stairs.\\n\\nIn some units, the only thing separating its owners from a 30-metre (98ft) fall is caution. And yet, to most of the inhabitants, conditions are better than what they previously had.\\n\\n\"The shanties don\\'t have services either and they\\'re far from everything,\" says Gregorio Laya, a 36 cook who recently moved in. \"Here I step out the door and there is a bus stop that takes me to my job in five minutes. This place is a blessing.\"',\n",
       " 'This post was written by Barry Seidel. Barry Seidel opened his own practice right out of law school in 1982, after reading “How to Go Directly Into Solo Law Practice, Without Missing a Meal”. His practice has evolved over the years, currently focusing in the areas of probate and estate administration. He enjoys writing and teaching about lawyer entrepreneurship, business development and marketing. His office is in Forest Hills, NY, serving clients and fellow lawyers in the NYC metropolitan area. Twitter | LinkedIn | Probate website | Per diem website | Blog\\n\\nI am in my 30th year of solo practice, having opened my office right out of school in 1982. I am in the 5th incarnation of the practice. There was no time when I ever “stopped” doing a particular type of case and “started” a new specialty. Things evolved, and they continue to do so. I had to make many business and personal decisions along the way. Sometimes they arose out of negatives (“I don’t want to be doing “that” any more) and sometimes the decisions were more prospective (I’d like to do ‘that’…or, I think ’that’ would work)\\n\\nThings I moved away from were never for naught. I learned, though sometimes not fast enough. I like to think that over time I’ve learned faster, took action sooner, and became bolder. It’s hard to know. I do know that when you want to make things better, sometimes you have to think hard, end the cycle of reaction, and make changes happen.\\n\\nHow and why I started as a solo right out of school\\n\\nIn the early 1980’s, I was in law school at The University of Texas. I’m a native New Yorker, so going to law school in Austin was not the usual path for a job back home in NYC. I suspect most law students envision themselves actual attorneys only in the abstract, if they think about it at all.\\n\\nFellow students didn’t talk about practicing law, only about getting into a good firm and some day making partner. I listened intently and spoke little. The first inkling of an employment problem came during my second year. Park Avenue and Wall Street firms recruited on campus. I interviewed with 20 firms. Each time it was like a bad blind date. I wondered if they hated me as much as I hated them. Easy question to answer, I never got a call back from the ‘name’ firms. I did get a second interview with a firm that defended accountant malpractice cases, but I don’t think there could have been enough money for me to spend my days doing that.\\n\\nDuring my second year, I took a part time job at a small Austin law firm, Montague & Smith* (*all names fictitious, all stories are true). On my first day, Joe Montague gave me my first assignment, to help his client, Mrs. Peterson. He told me she was a 50 year old woman with cerebral palsy who he had represented on her two divorces. He said she was a decent client who paid her fees, so he wanted me to solve her present problem, some kind of insurance question. He wasn’t sure exactly what it was because he couldn’t understand her over the phone. He said to drive over to her house, straighten it out, and keep track of my time so the firm could bill her.\\n\\nMrs. Peterson spoke loud and slurred. We walked slowly to her dinette table and she showed me stacks of papers. The whole situation was a mess; two years of Blue Cross claims unsubmitted, rejected, and neglected. Claim letters and lawsuits from doctors. No recollections, wrong recollections, mis-informations. This was not a case that required any research, just plain talk, patience and persistence. I was in my element. I put in some hours and got the mess organized. I showed Joe what was going on and we determined that some of the situations were appropriate for his associates to work on. I was an instant hero at Montague & Smith, mostly because I saved anyone else from having to deal with the messiest stuff. They were paying me $10 per hour, and I saw that they billed $100 per hour for my time. I had no problem with that, and was kind of proud that I “made money for the firm”.\\n\\nStill thinking I wanted Park Avenue, I left Texas after two years to attend Fordham Law as a visiting student. I got another part-time job, with a Manhattan solo practitioner named Fred Shulman.* He had all kinds of wacky cases. My first assignment there was representative of the flavor of the place: Fred’s client owned a bar, which was about to be closed by the Liquor Authority because it was allegedly a drug dealing location. Fred had brought a proceeding to stop the liquor license suspension while the case was being reviewed. My assignment was to review the transcripts and write something to convince the liquor authority to let him keep his license. The problem was, undercover agents had recorded many conversations of people asking the owner where they could find “Joe with the good blow”, and the owner had consistently directed them to his back office. I asked Fred how we could possibly overcome this, and he said we couldn’t but we had been paid to buy some time to keep them open through Christmas season. I loved working for Fred. Park Avenue firms started to lose their appeal.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I was still in law school and going to awkward interviews. I got a second interview from a firm doing surety law. I didn’t even know what surety law was, which may be why I didn’t get the job. (I actually learned what it was about 5 years ago, and it probably would have been interesting). It was a tight job market then too, with no jobs at the District Attorneys office or even at legal aid.\\n\\nNo jobs, but no panic, just an idea gnawing at me.I want to open my own solo practice. The facts were: I had no money, few contacts, no clients, and no clue how to do this. So I sat down with the Placement Director at Fordham, and told her what I was thinking. She said, “It’s an unusual idea.” then added, “Statistically only about 3% of graduates nationally do that, and I’ve never heard of anyone in New York.” She looked down, sorry that she had disappointed me. But she hadn’t. I stood up, hesitated, and said, “You mean, people actually DO it? 3%? Are you sure?” She replied, “I don’t know, I mean I never, I’m sorry, but wait a minute” She fumbled around in her desk while she spoke “I heard about a book…..I don’t have it….I haven’t read it….but I saw an ad……here it is, it’s by a guy named Singer, take a look at this, you could probably get it at Barnes & Noble”.\\n\\nThere it was, an ad for “How To Go Directly Into Solo Practice, Without Missing A Meal’, by Gerald Singer. Thirty years later I remember that trip to Barnes & Noble as a trail of smoke and dust. I flew out of her office, off on another mission. The book was in the back of the store, with a bright blue cover amidst the real law books. I bought the book and started reading it on the subway. When I looked up I was five stops past my station, with my heart pounding. This guy’s plan, conceived in Los Angeles, could actually work! Not only that, it would work even better in New York. I knew it.\\n\\nAlthough my law office officially opened a year later (the day I was admitted to practice),\\n\\nI wanted to get started. That day I started a subscription to the New York Law Journal. This is a daily newspaper for New York lawyers. Besides articles about law, it also had a huge classified section, filled with ads for jobs, part-time jobs, offices, situations wanted, business opportunities, seminars, and court calendars. I started reading the Law Journal every day, and I still do. It keeps you in shape for daily practice. It should be read carefully and with feeling, like it’s the most important thing you can do for yourself. The Law Journal was a business transformer for entrepreneurial lawyers; you just had to plug in.\\n\\nI then set in motion the strategies of “How to Go Directly Into Solo Law Practice….”. In a nutshell, the idea was to find a ‘time for space’ arrangement for an office, including referrals of legal work and cases. Next, introduce yourself to other lawyers in the same suite and in the building and get legal assignments and referrals. If that didn’t get you busy, knock on doors in the rest of the building. Then, send announcements to every person and entity you’ve known in your whole life. Add in your own creativity and don’t look back. You could also get on some referral panels, do a little advertising, and otherwise think like a businessperson with a valuable product to sell.\\n\\nI then called Fred and asked if he’d let me work part-time once I was a lawyer. Besides the cash flow from working part-time, I knew I’d need him for advice when real clients and cases came in. He was on board from the start. I used to call him all the time. Some of my best days later on were when he started to call ME for advice.\\n\\nWhile still in school, I saw an ad in the Law Journal for a company called “Educated & Dedicated”. I don’t remember their exact ad, but it was basically “our clients need a messenger who can figure out what to do when they get there”. The description was accurate. One of their clients was a company called “Federal Document Retrieval”, who sent me to copy files at various places in New York, mostly the Federal Courts. Their clients were big law firms all over the country. I even made a few runs to the Federal Archives in Bayonne, New Jersey. “E&D” always wanted me to call them directly, never their clients, but one day I was stuck in Bayonne and couldn’t find what their client wanted. Nobody at “E&D” knew what to do, so I called Suzanne at Federal Document Retrieval directly. We got the info straight, and she started asking me about myself, and I briefly told her my life story. She asked me to talk to her boss Doug, the owner. He got on the phone, had me re-tell my story and then asked, “How would you like to be our exclusive agent in New York?”……. and from then on I was.\\n\\nNext time - Everything and Anything Phase….',\n",
       " 'SAN JOSE (CBS SF) — A San Jose resident from Russia who is gay and HIV-positive has been detained at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Florida for more than a month since returning from a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\\n\\nDenis Davydov, 30, arrived in the U.S. legally from Moscow in September 2014 and overstayed his six-month visa. He has applied for political asylum, according to Sergey Piskunov with RUSA LGBT, a group for Russian-speaking members of the LGBT community.\\n\\n“He’s a gay man and HIV-positive,” Piskunov said. “Russia is not the best place for either of those and he’s a combination of both.”\\n\\nDavydov was on his way home to the Bay Area in early March when he encountered federal agents in an airport, according to Piskunov.\\n\\n“They checked his documents, and he said they were trying really hard to find something wrong,” Piskunov said. “They put him on a plane to Miami and transported him to Florida.”\\n\\nNestor Yglesias, a spokesman for ICE in Florida, confirmed Tuesday that Davydov was arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and is currently in custody at the Krome Detention Center in Miami.\\n\\n“They made the arrest,” Yglesias said. “He’s in our custody because they don’t have detention space.”\\n\\nYglesias referred further questions regarding Davydov’s case to Customs and Border Protection.\\n\\nAfter a request for information about exactly where and when Davydov was detained, as well as any deportation proceedings that may be taking place, CBP spokesman Keith Smith said he would look into the matter but Department of Homeland Security privacy policies typically “preclude us from releasing information regarding individual travelers.”\\n\\nDavydov is receiving his HIV medications every day while in detention but he needs to see a doctor and has been unable to access one, according to Piskunov. That claim could not be confirmed with federal agents.\\n\\n“This is one of the reasons we really want to get him out of there,” Piskunov said.\\n\\nIf he gets deported, however, Davydov could face dire circumstances and difficulty accessing health care in Russia.\\n\\n“I believe he’s not going to live too long,” Piskunov said. “We have several friends in common who passed away because of HIV consequences.”\\n\\n“They have money for war in Ukraine, Crimea, Syria – they have money for all these military expenses but they don’t have money for the medical system,” Piskunov said. “And they don’t care.”\\n\\n© Copyright 2017 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service.

       " 'Will Newly Trained Troops Fare Any Better Than the Old Ones?\\n\\nIn a move Pentagon officials are calling a significant test of their new training program, some 3,000 US-trained Iraqi troops are taking up positions around Ramadi, the capital of the Anbar Province, and preparing for an attack on the major ISIS-held city.\\n\\nOfficials say this is the “first time” US-trained soldiers will be taking on ISIS in such a major clash, though that’s not really true, since the US trained the bulk of Iraq’s military during last decade’s occupation in the first place, and those troops were the ones ISIS routed in taking so much of the country’s west.\\n\\nIt’s not all that clear how different the new training is from the old training, which didn’t work, and it remains to be seen if the Iraqi troops will fare any better this time than they did before, when they had even larger numerical superiority and were defending Ramadi from ISIS.\\n\\nOne difference, however, is that some 500 Sunni tribesmen will be taking part in the battle on Iraq’s side. The US has tried to convince large numbers of Sunnis to back the Shi’ite dominated government, but deadly sectarian purges by the government’s Shi’ite militia allies have alienated many.\\n\\nLast 5 posts by Jason Ditz',\n",
       " 'Accused mass murderer Alexandre Bissonnette, the only suspect in the Quebec City mosque shooting, is reportedly a legal firearms owner.\\n\\nAccording to Le Journal de Quebec, Bissonnette, 27, who allegedly shot six worshippers to death on January 29, had two guns on him the night of the shooting—a CZ 858 rifle and a 9mm pistol.\\n\\nOwning a pistol requires a restricted license in Canada, which means that police—in Bissonnette\\'s case the Sûreté du Québec—would screen a person for mental health issues, violence, a criminal record, and would check in with at least two character references. But the system relies partially on self-reporting and on the applicant\\'s references to be truthful.\\n\\nRead more: Alleged Quebec Mosque Shooter a Pro-Trump Troll, Says Classmate\\n\\nBissonnette is believed to have received his license two years ago, but Le Journal de Quebec report says he was more recently taking medication for anxiety and had issues with alcohol. The article also said people in Bissonnette\\'s gun club found his behaviour \"bizarre\" but never spoke out about it.\\n\\nThough limited, this information suggests that there are holes in Canada\\'s licensing system.\\n\\nA.J Somerset, the London, Ontario-based author of Arms: the Culture & Credo of the Gun, a book about North American gun culture, told VICE there are a couple of issues with the self-reporting aspect of licensing here. First off—a person can just lie about their mental health status.\\n\\n\"All that\\'s really hanging over your head is if you lie on an application and you get caught, you\\'re probably never going to get a licenses after that.\"\\n\\nAnd while a person\\'s name can be run through Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) to look for any incidents involving police, authorities don\\'t have that option to detect a history of mental illness, Somerset said.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a confidential health record, it\\'s not something police can easily search. It\\'s not something where they can go to very psychiatrist in Quebec City and ask \\'Is this guy being treated for anxiety?\\'\" And allowing cops access to that information would be an infringement of civil liberties.\\n\\nRead more: It Shouldn\\'t Take a Massacre to Humanize Muslims\\n\\nSomerset pointed out that while you would hope a gun owner\\'s references would mention concerns, \"your references are your buddies.\"\\n\\nHe told VICE due to the correlation between drinking and violence, things like a history of drunk driving offences, should be a red flag when someone is applying for a license. He also suggested that a person\\'s interests in extreme ideology should be flagged.\\n\\nBissonnette\\'s acquaintances described being a right-wing troll—one even called him an \"ultra nationalist white supremacist.\" He allegedly admired far right French politician Marine Le Pen.\\n\\nSomerset said these interests should catch the attention of the cops overseeing Canada\\'s licensing regime.\\n\\n\"Someone who reads Infowars and believes right wing conspiracy theories or is a member of the Soldiers of Odin, I wouldn\\'t suggest that you automatically report those people,\" he said. \"But when you see somebody who is just off, I think we need to be more willing to say \\'Maybe this guy shouldn\\'t have a gun\\'.\"\\n\\nTo that end, he said there can be an us-versus-them attitude between gun owners and cops, which is perhaps why fellow gun owners who saw Bissonnette acting \"bizarre\" on the range may have been reluctant to speak out.\\n\\nSomerset is a former Canadian soldier and hunter, who is pro gun control. His book has been highly criticized by the Canadian firearms community.\\n\\nRod Giltaca, President of the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, told VICE no us-versus-them attitude exists. He gun owners want nothing to do with alleged murderers like Bissonnette.\\n\\n\"I would think if someone had a legitimate concern they would have brought it to the attention of the police. We have seen countless examples of mildly concerning or even benign behavior from many infamous murderers in recorded history and we still haven\\'t figured out how to pick them out of the crowd,\" he said.\\n\\nWhen asked about the larger flaws surrounding Canada\\'s licensing laws, however, Giltaca said there are no easy solutions.\\n\\n\"The truth is that there is no regulatory system on guns, knives, hands or cars that can eliminate violent behavior,\" he said, noting that most of Canada\\'s 2.1 million legal gun owners are law abiding citizens.\\n\\n\"Politically it\\'s far easier to create more regulations that mass murderers and criminal will continue to ignore. This tactic fits neatly in a single election cycle and leaves the root cause untouched.\"\\n\\nFollow Manisha Krishnan on Twitter.',\n",
       " 'As part of his deeply unfortunate response to the latest terror attack in London, Donald Trump declared his intention to “get down to the business of security for our people.” He then went golfing for a few hours.\\n\\nBefore hitting the links, the president didn’t specify what getting down to business would entail, exactly, but if Trump had a director of the FBI, it’d be a helpful step in the right direction.\\n\\nIt’s been nearly a month since the president fired then-FBI Director James Comey because of Trump’s concerns about the counter-espionage investigation Comey was leading, and as is too often the case, the White House hadn’t lined up a successor before making the move.\\n\\nFour days after the firing, Trump pledged to move quickly to nominate a new director. A few days after that, the president said he was “very close” to announcing Comey’s replacement.\\n\\nAnd yet, here were are, more than two weeks later, waiting for an announcement. Reuters reported the other day that the process of finding a new director isn’t going especially well in part because of the president’s role.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump is still looking for a new FBI director more than three weeks after he fired James Comey, and sources familiar with the recruiting process say it has been chaotic and that job interviews led by Trump have been brief. […] Those conversations, which followed initial interviews at the Justice Department, have been light on questions about substantive issues facing the agency, the three associates said.\\n\\nAccording to Reuters’ reporting, one prospective director reportedly described the process as “chaotic” and said that in one interview, “Trump spoke mostly about himself and seemed distracted.”\\n\\nThat’s very easy to believe. By all appearances, the president has no meaningful understanding of what an FBI director does, so the fact that he’s involved in the interview process is bound to be a hindrance.\\n\\nI just hope Trump doesn’t hand copies of the 2016 electoral map to those under consideration.\\n\\nPart of the challenge goes beyond simply finding the right person for the job; it also involves someone who actually wants the job. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) was under consideration, but withdrew. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) soon after did the same thing.\\n\\nThe fact that these three were even considered was odd – we’ve never had a politician serve as a permanent FBI director before – but I imagine Trump was looking for someone he’s seen on television, and those with lengthy careers in federal law enforcement are less widely recognized.',\n",

       " \"President Trump wants to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure over the next 10 years, but the federal government's role in infrastructure is limited. Is there money in the form of private capital to help?\\n\\nDONALD Trump has a $3.8 trillion problem that could lead to China eclipsing the US as the most powerful economy on Earth.\\n\\nAcross the United States, roads, tunnels and bridges are crumbling, and Mr Trump is yet to present a detailed plan on how to fix it.\\n\\nAs the global economy expands and power shifts, the world has begun an infrastructure race — and the US has fallen well behind.\\n\\nAccording to the Australian-based Global Infrastructure Hub (GIH), the US has the biggest gap of any country between what it plans to spend on infrastructure and what is needed over the next quarter century.\\n\\nOn current trends, the States is likely to invest $US8.5 trillion between now and 2040, but the GIH found it would need an investment about 45 per cent higher — $12.4 trillion — to meet its needs. That leaves a $3.8 trillion deficit, of which 90 per cent is needed for building and maintaining roads and highways.\\n\\nThere seems to be bipartisan support to fix the problem in Washington, but no real plan on how to fix it.\\n\\nMr Trump has acknowledged the crisis, promising a $1 trillion package to rebuild crumbling infrastructure, but he has not articulated how it would be paid for. He has, however, detailed ways to cut red tape to speed up complex road-building projects. Meanwhile, he is pushing to cut business and income taxes before the end of the year, which could limit Washington’s capacity to supercharge infrastructure spending.\\n\\nGIH chief executive officer Chris Heathcote said the President knew what the problem was but did not have the structures in place to fix it.\\n\\n“He’s got the right idea. He’s correctly diagnosed the disease: chronic under-investment in infrastructure,” Mr Heathcote told news.com.au from Washington, where he addressed leaders on the infrastructure gap.\\n\\n“President Trump has recognised the need. He wants to drive deals because that is what he would say is his core differentiator.\\n\\n“The problem is the federal government doesn’t really do the deals. That’s for the states. He can’t raise that money at federal level.”\\n\\nThe US’s chief economic rival, China, is not facing the same problems.\\n\\nThe country’s booming development over the past decade has been coupled with a massive investment in infrastructure — and that is forecast to continue over the next 23 years.\\n\\nOn current trends, China will invest $26.5 trillion between now and 2040, $1.9 trillion shy of the $28.4 trillion GIH suggests is needed.\\n\\n“[The Chinese] take this very seriously,” Mr Heathcote told news.com.au.\\n\\nAnd research shows the Chinese are on the right track. The International Monetary Fund found that one percentage point of gross domestic product (GDP) invested in infrastructure leads to 1.5 per cent GDP growth within four years.\\n\\nThe warnings come as Chinese President Xi Jinping outlined his goal to for the nation to become the No. 1 superpower within the next 30 years.\\n\\nHe said “it was time for his nation to transform itself into a mighty force” that could lead the entire world on political, economic, military and environmental issues.\\n\\nIn terms of clawing back ground on crumbling infrastructure, Mr Trump could learn from Australia, which has a similar system of government but has as relatively small infrastructure funding gap of $0.158 trillion.\\n\\nAustralia has found success by using alternative structures, such as public-private partnerships (PPPs) and asset recycling, to fund big new projects.\\n\\nMr Heathcote said our centralised body Infrastructure Australia was a favourable model because it worked outside of election cycles to identify building priorities and create incentives for private investment. Asset recycling, which sees a government-owned asset such as power poles and wires sold off to pay for new projects, has also helped to pay for new infrastructure without tax hikes.\\n\\n“Infrastructure Australia sets the priorities, they act independently. You end up with a set of plans that interlock,” Mr Heathcote said.\\n\\n“The US is different. There’s no central planning.”\\n\\nWhen he became president, Mr Trump said his massive rebuilding effort could be boosted by private investment, but he has since backed off that plan, telling politicians that public-private partnerships (PPPs) don’t work, according to The Washington Post.\\n\\nMr Heathcote said government budgets were not enough to close the gap.\\n\\nIf new strategies, such as PPPs, are not considered, the only alternatives are increased taxes and debt, which Mr Trump strongly opposes.\\n\\n“If people are unwilling to countenance user-pay, PPPs and private-sector ownership, then there needs to be a talk about where that money is coming from,” he said.\\n\\nMr Heathcote said Mr Trump could leave a lasting legacy if he put in place new structures that centralised long-term infrastructure planning, standardised funding processes, opened up federal grant programs and created better incentives for private companies to invest.\\n\\n“If I was in Trump’s shoes, and thank God I’m not, the message I would be giving is we need to find a different way of doing this, infrastructure creation. He has to put in place a centralised planning body, make money go as far as possible,” he said.\\n\\n“My call to arms is for the US to consider what is the best way to make the states more effective to spend the very scarce tax dollars they get.\\n\\n“It could be a real game-changer. It requires real vision to drive this fundamental change.”\\n\\nAcross the globe, $US97 trillion is needed to meet the globe’s infrastructure needs by 2040.\\n\\nAustralian ambassador the United States, Joe Hockey, told a breakfast of leaders in Washington last week that is was vital for the world to solve this problem.\\n\\n“Everyone must be an advocate for infrastructure,” he said.\\n\\n“If we don’t advocate for it, it will cost jobs and reduce the prosperity of all nations.”\",\n",

His appearance will mark the third consecutive year that Hall, 28, will run America\\'s oldest marathon, one of the five commercial races of the World Marathon Majors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am excited to be part of the John Hancock elite team for the third year in a row,\" Hall said in a prepared statement referring to John Hancock Financial, the Boston-based insurance giant which provides the funding for the race\\'s elite fields. \"I can\\'t wait to be back in Hopkinton in April ready to test myself over the most historic marathon course in America. I love the Boston Marathon and hope that both my experience training on and racing in the Boston Marathon will lead to something very special in the 2011 race.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBoston will be the first marathon Hall will contest without the coaching of Terrence Mahon of the Mammoth Track Club. Hall left Mahon\\'s group to coach himself after withdrawing from the Bank of America Chicago Marathon last October citing fatigue and over-training. Under Mahon\\'s coaching, Hall broke the American record for the half-marathon in 2007 (59:43), set a USA marathon debut record of 2:08:24 in London in 2007, won the USA Olympic Trials marathon later that year in a championships record of 2:09:02, then became the first-ever American-born athlete to break the 2:07 barrier, clocking a 2:06:17 personal best at London in 2008. Hall, who also finished 10th at the Olympic Games marathon in Beijing, and remains the second-fastest American ever behind former world record holder Khalid Khannouchi.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt Boston, Hall has enjoyed qualified successes. In his first attempt on the hilly course from Hopkinton to Boston\\'s Back Bay in 2009, the Stanford graduate did much of the leading in the first half of the race, fell all the way back to 9th place in the race\\'s middle stages, but battled back in the hills of Newton to finish third in 2:09:40. In 2010, Hall was again up front early, fell back, but rallied to finish fourth in 2:08:41, the best time ever run by an American in Boston. He was, however, well behind the winners Deriba Merga of Ethiopia (2009) and Robert Kiprono Cheruiyot (2001) both years.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn American man has not won the Boston Marathon since 1983 when Greg Meyer prevailed in 2:09:01. But the resurgence in USA marathon running in the last ten years has at least put Americans in contention again. American men have cracked the top-5 in three of the last five editions of the race (two in 2010, one in 2009 and three in 2006). Hall has done it twice, and clearly finds Boston\\'s traditions alluring.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Regardless of the day\\'s results, all of us who take on the unique journey of covering the 26.2 trying miles to Boylston Street can all say we partook in history,\" Hall concluded. \"I am training with eager anticipation for the opportunity that the Boston Marathon offers, believing that all things are possible. What better place to break through than in Boston?\"\\n\\nDiscuss: Ryan Hall Running Boston',\n",

And, by 2014, Werner had to take side jobs unrelated to GnuPG to supplement his income.\\n\\nThe situation looked so bad that Werner was ready to give up. But, friends convinced him to give a donation campaign one last shot. The response was amazing. Not only did he receive enough money to fund himself, but he pulled in 250 000 euros in small donations, and Stripe, Facebook and the Linux Foundation each committed to donating about 50 000 euros per year.\\n\\nGiven this amazing response, Werner decided to grow the team again. To date, he has hired 5 developers, and the past two years have seen a number of improvements to GnuPG and the surrounding ecosystem. For instance, we've worked on simplifying key discovery, adopted a set of Python bindings for GPG, contributed some improvements to Enigmail, and supported the Gnuk project—a free source and free hardware security token.\\n\\nWe want to continue this work in the long term. But, we want to do so in such a way that our first loyalty is unambiguously to the general public. This means making sure that a majority of our funding comes from individual donors, and not corporations. Further, to ensure long-term stability, our focus is on recurring donations and not one-time donations.\\n\\nOur primary goal is to get donation commitments for 15 000 euros per month—enough to fund 3 developers. We can reach this goal if just 2000 people donate 5 or 10 euros each month, the equivalent of just 2 or 3 cups of coffee.\",\n",

The law puts NGOs under the supervision of Public Security Departments under China’s State Council, giving these organs broad powers to control NGOs’ personnel decisions, programs, and grant-making, even giving them apparently unrestricted access to the organizations’ computers and bank accounts.

       " \"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Pinterest Print Mail Flipboard\\n\\nBill O’Reilly had Glenn Beck on his FNC program tonight for what could best be described as a tag team effort to discredit the Color of Change boycott of advertisers on Beck’s show. O’Reilly claimed that the boycott was being carried out by “left wing loons.” Beck blamed Van Jones, and the commies in the Obama administration.\\n\\nHere is the video courtesy of Media Matters:\\n\\nO’Reilly said, “You may remember that earlier this year a fanatical left pressure group called Think Progress tried to get sponsors to boycott The O’Reilly Factor. That effort failed dismally, now Glenn Beck is under fire from another crazy group founded by a guy who is working inside the Obama administration.”\\n\\nBill-O continued the spin job by later saying, “You’ve got far left loons are over the place in this country, and they want to hurt you and they want to hurt me, because they don’t really believe in freedom of speech, the far left loons. They want to hear what they want and if you oppose them, they hate you.”\\n\\nBeck went on the attack against Van Jones. Beck admitted that he didn’t know if Jones was targeting him but said, “I have been telling the truth about this guy for some time. This guy is our new green jobs czar, and he is a self proclaimed communist revolutionary, named his four year old son after a Marxist guerilla out of Africa…believes that Mao Zedong was a great guy. He is now in the White House as a special advisor.”\\n\\nInstead of being a radical group as Beck and O’Reilly charge, here is what Color of Change does according to their website, “ColorOfChange.org is comprised of Black folks from every economic class, as well as those of every color who seek to help our voices be heard. Our members are united behind a simple, powerful pledge: we will do all we can to make sure all Americans are represented, served, and protected—regardless of race or class.”\\n\\nSo Beck and O’Reilly considers a group that is out to politically organize minorities to be radical. Something tells me that if Color of Change was a bunch of white people backing Republicans, Beck and O’Reilly would be praising them. If I understand this correctly, Beck is having his free speech violated, even though he still has his show and is free to say whatever he wants because some advertisers left him.\\n\\nNotice how Glenn and Bill conveniently ignore the fact that the boycott started when Beck called Obama a racist on Fox and Friends. Advisers aren’t leaving Beck because of communists in the White House. They are leaving Beck because race based politics scares the hell out of corporate America. Beck brought this all on himself.\\n\\nThis segment tonight was the beginning of the Fox News push back against the boycott. They are going to try to frame it as a bunch of radical lefties out to get Beck. Unlike the Think Progress boycott of O’Reilly which did have very little success, the Color of Change boycott has worked. FNC can try to spin this any way they want, but it has been a constant headache for Beck and the network.\\n\\nIf you’re ready to read more from the unbossed and unbought Politicus team, sign up for our newsletter here!

       " 'In a previous essay, I interviewed four self-published authors I admire, and I examined some of the benefits of that career path. Midway through writing the piece, I realized I’d have to continue the discussion in a second essay in order to fully explore my feelings (complicated) on the topic (multifaceted). You see, Reader, I still don’t plan on self-publishing my first novel, though I don’t deny the positive aspects of that choice.\\n\\nBelow I’ve outlined a few reasons behind my decision, informed by our contemporary moment. I can’t predict the future, though I’m sure I’ll remain comfortable with my opinions for at least another thirteen months. It’s in a list format, the pet genre of the blogosphere. How else was I to keep my head from imploding?\\n\\n1. I Guess I’m Not a Hater\\n\\nPeople love to talk about how traditional publishing is dying, but is that actually true? According to The New York Times, the industry has seen a 5.8% increase in net revenue since 2008. E-books are “another bright spot” in the industry, and the revenue of adult fiction grew by 8.8% in three years. (Take that, Twilight!)\\n\\nOf course, the industry has troubles. The slim profit margins of books; the problems of bookstore returns; the quandary of Borders closing and Amazon forever selling books as a loss-leader; how to make people actually pay for content, and so on. Furthermore, the gamble of the large advance strikes me as ridiculous — and reckless, considering that editors and marketing teams have no real clue which books will be hits and which ones won’t. (Still, what writer is going to kick half-a-million out of bed?) And there’s the always-chilling question: With mounting pressure to turn a profit, how do editors justify publishing an amazing book that might not speak to a large audience? Talented authors — new and mid-list — are bound to get lost in this system.\\n\\nAnd yet. And yet. I read good books by large publishing houses all the time, books that take my breath away, make me laugh and cry and wonder at the brilliance of humanity. I trust publishers. They don’t always get it right, but more often than not, they do. As I said in the piece that started me off on this whole investigation: “I want a reputable publishing house standing behind my book; I want them to tell you it’s good so that I don’t have to.”\\n\\n2. I Write Literary Fiction\\n\\nBefore you get your talons out, let me clarify: I don’t consider literary fiction superior to other kinds of fiction, just different; to me, it’s simply another genre, subject-wise and/or marketing-wise. Many of the writers who have found success in self-publishing are writers of straightforward genre fiction. Amanda Hocking writes young adult fantasy, dwarfs and all. Valerie Forster, who published traditionally before setting out on her own, writes legal thrillers. Romance, too, often does just fine without a publisher. Aside from Anthropology of An American Girl by Hilary Thayer Hamann, I can’t think of another literary novel that enjoyed critical praise and healthy sales when self-published. That’s not to say that it can’t — and shouldn’t — happen, it’s only to point out that it’s a tougher road for writers of certain sorts of stories. Readers like me aren’t seeking out self-published books. Why not? That’s for another essay. (Please, can someone else write that one?) Until the likes of Jeffrey Eugenides and Alice Munro begin publishing their work via CreateSpace, I don’t see the landscape for literary fiction changing anytime soon.\\n\\n3. I’d Prefer a Small Press to a Vanity Press\\n\\nThe conversation about self-publishing too often ignores the role of independent publishing houses in this shifting reading landscape. Whether it be larger independents like Algonquin and Graywolf, or small gems like Featherproof and Two Dollar Radio, or university presses like Lookout Books, the imprint at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, which recently published Edith Pearlman’s Binocular Vision (nominated for this year’s National Book Award), independent presses offer diversity to readers, and provide yet another professional option for authors. These presses are run and curated by well-read, talented people, and they provide readers with the same services that a large press provides: namely, a vote of confidence in a writer the public might have never heard of. Smaller presses, too, enjoy a specificity of brand and identity that too often eludes a larger house.\\n\\nIn this terrific interview, publisher Fred Ramey of Unbridled Books puts it this way:\\n\\nI believe that the iron grip that large publishers and their marketing partners have had on readers’ attention since the 1990s has slipped quite a bit with the arrival of online retailers and opinion-makers. Obviously patrons of online booksellers can see the breadth of reading options – “Others who bought this item also bought….” Patrons of independent bookstores know of those options, too, and depend on the recommendations of their booksellers. The few “designated” titles from the big house are still dominant, of course, even in independent stores. But if you are an author in one of those corporations whose book has not been “designated” your reality can become pretty stark.\\n\\nIndependent presses can offer a real chance to a talented writer who might not fit the formulas of the big house. Yes, I know that each conglomerate has a few imprints and a good many editors dedicated to the best of books — to maintaining the course of American letters. Those are the prestigious imprints that aren’t always required to pretend the sales of a prior book predict the performance of the next book. (I’m often astounded at how willing the industry is to act as though it believes that. We all know it isn’t true.) But independent presses are all dedicated to finding and presenting the best of books, dedicated to the books in and of themselves and to the promise of the authors.\\n\\nA year ago, I published my novella If You’re Not Yet Like Me with a tiny press called Flatmancrooked, and I consider it the highlight of my career so far. Not only did I get to work with a sharp and talented editor, Deena Drewis, and have my book designed by the press’s risk-taking founder Elijah Jenkins, I also had so much fun participating in the press’s LAUNCH program, where the limited first-edition went on pre-order for just a week. My book sold out in three days, and getting that first paycheck was exhilarating. My tiny book got me on a panel at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, a few awesome readings, and it even found its way to two different editors at larger houses. It became my literary calling card. When readers received my book in the mail, it was signed and numbered by me. It also came with a condom.\\n\\nFlatmancrooked, sadly, closed its doors earlier this year, but Drewis has continued the LAUNCH program with her new press, Nouvella. The success of Flatmancrooked showed me that small can mean flexible and daring in its editorial and marketing choices. Small presses try things that large, established houses are too huge, and possibly too chickenshit, to even consider. The fact that Flatmancrooked is now defunct showed me that a labor of love is still a labor (especially when its laborers have other full-time jobs to go to), and that instability is unavoidable in the small press (or the small, small, small press) game.\\n\\nSome writers are forever wed to the small press landscape. Others, like Blake Butler, Amelia Gray, Benjamin Percy, and Emma Straub first published with smaller outfits and have since moved onto larger houses. Perhaps the small press world is becoming the real proving ground for literary writers.\\n\\n4. Self-Publishing is Better for the Already-Published\\n\\nPerhaps the smarter, and far more seductive, path is the one where the writer begins his career with a traditional publisher, and then, once he’s built a base of loyal readers, sets off on his own. The man who loves to talk smack about the publishing industry, J.A. Konrath, already had an audience from his traditionally-published books by the time he decided to take matters into his own hands. It’s much harder to create a readership out of nothing.\\n\\nI’m interested to see how Neal Pollack’s latest novel, Jewball, does as a self-published book. Short story writer Tod Goldberg is also trying this approach with his new mini-collection, Where You Lived, self-published as an e-book. I don’t need an intermediary to tell me about these writers because their previously published books speak for them.\\n\\n5. I Value the Publishing Community\\n\\nI decided to ask the most famous writer I know, Peter Straub, if he’s ever considered leaving the world of big publishing and putting out a book all by his lonesome. After all, he’s a bestselling author and editor of more than 25 books (18 novels alone!), and he’s a horror writer beloved by genre geeks and snobby literary types alike. A few of his fans probably sport tattoos of his bespectacled face on their pecs. (Or: Peter Straub tramp stamps! Yes!) In an email response, Straub acknowledged how quickly the publishing world and our reading habits are changing, and he said he just might experiment with self-publishing short fiction in the coming years. He told me:\\n\\nTrue self-publication means writers upload content themselves, and plenty already do it. I’m not quite sure how you then publicize the work in question, or get it reviewed, but that I am unsure about these elements is part of the reason I seek always, at least for the present, to have my work published in book form by an old-style trade publisher. The trade publisher, which has contracted for the right to do so, then brings the book out in e-form and as an audiobook, so I am not ignoring that audience.\\n\\nWhat he went on to say gave me a special kind of hope:\\n\\nMost of the editors I have worked with over the past thirty-five years have made crucial contributions to the books entrusted to them, and the copy-editors have always, in every case, done exactly the same. They have enriched the books that came into their hands. Can you have good, thoughtful, creative editing and precise, accurate, immaculate copy-editing if you self-publish? And if you can’t, what is being said about the status or role of selflessness before the final form of the fiction as accepted by the audience, I mean the willingness of the author to submerge his ego to produce the novel that is truest to itself?\\n\\nThis — this! — I get. Even though my first novel was rejected by traditional publishers, one assistant editor’s notes on it — notes that were thorough, thoughtful, challenging, and compassionate — were enough to show me that these professionals are valuable to the process of book-making. I know you can hire experienced editors and copy-editors, but how is that role affected when the person paying is the writer himself? What if the hired editor told you not to publish? Would that even happen?\\n\\n6. The E-Reading Conundrum; or, I don’t want to be Amazon’s Bitch\\n\\nMany self-published authors have gone totally electronic, eschewing print versions of their work altogether. I can’t see myself taking that route, however, because I don’t own an e-reader, and I don’t have plans to buy one (not yet, anyway… I read a lot in the bath, etc., etc.). It seems odd that I wouldn’t be able to buy my own book — I mean, shouldn’t I be my own ideal reader? I also prefer to shop at independent bookstores, and in fact, I pay full price for my books all the time. The thought of Amazon being the only place to purchase my novel shivers my timbers. I don’t mind if someone else chooses to read my work electronically, just as I don’t mind if Amazon is one of the places to purchase my work; I’m simply wary of Amazon monopolizing the reading landscape. Self-publishing has certainly offered an alternative path for writers, but it’s naive to believe that a self-published author is “fighting the system” if that self-published book is produced and made available by a single monolithic corporation. In effect, they’ve rejected “The Big 6” for “The Big 1.”\\n\\n7. Is it Best for Readers?\\n\\nIn September, when my brother-in-law learned that my book still hadn’t sold, he said, “Please don’t self-publish!” He was actually wincing. If I did self-publish, he said, he’d buy it because we were family, but otherwise, he’d happily ignore my novel in search of something he’d read about on The Millions, or heard about on NPR, or had a friend recommend. There are simply too many books out there as it is.\\n\\nOur conversation reminded me of Laura Miller’s humorous and perspicacious essay, “When Anyone Can be a Published Author,” in which she reminds us that the people who celebrate self-publishing often overlook what it means for book buyers and readers. She writes:\\n\\nReaders themselves rarely complain that there isn’t enough of a selection on Amazon or in their local superstore; they’re more likely to ask for help in narrowing down their choices. So for anyone who has, however briefly, played that reviled gatekeeper role, a darker question arises: What happens once the self-publishing revolution really gets going, when all of those previously rejected manuscripts hit the marketplace, en masse, in print and e-book form, swelling the ranks of 99-cent Kindle and iBook offerings by the millions? Is the public prepared to meet the slush pile?\\n\\nAs a member of the reading public, I am not prepared, or willing, to wade through all that unfiltered literature. As a writer, I must put my head back to the grindstone and write a book that more than a handful of readers can fall in love with.\\n\\n8. I’m Busy. Writing.\\n\\nToday I wrote two pages of my new novel while my mother took my five-month-old son to the mall. I get twelve hours of childcare a week, and six of those are dedicated to preparing for my classes and running a private writing school. The other six hours I devote to my new novel. The old one, the one that traditional editors didn’t go nuts for, is in the drawer. Some might say I’ve given up; I say, I’m just getting warmed up. I’m still writing, aren’t I? My career isn’t one book, but many. And like every other writer out there, I decide what road I want to travel.\\n\\nImage credit: purplesmog/Flickr',\n",

       " 'There are few semi-academic lines more famous than, “There are lies, damned lies, and statistics.” It is certainly true that statistics give a sheen of legitimacy to claims that often make it easier to mislead people. This seems to be especially true of economic statistics. This column will review some of the most common ways people use economic statistics to mislead people and falsely support weak or incorrect arguments. Hopefully, this will make it easier for you to spot such bad use of economic statistics and learn how to defeat arguments based on such economic falsehoods and distortions.\\n\\nThe first category of lies with economic statistics is based on a failure to adjust for some non-constant variable crucial to the statistic being used to make your point.\\n\\nA great example is the focus on stagnation in median household income. That “fact” is created by a number of factors, including poor calculation of the income in question and use of the wrong inflation measure but even if calculated correctly, median household income is misleading because the average household size has been shrinking. In fact, hours worked per household declined 5% from 2004 to 2014. In turns out to be much harder for a household to earn more money when it works fewer hours. The idea that the income of a median family has stalled is based significantly not on hourly pay, but on the fact that fewer hours are being worked, mostly because there are fewer workers in the average household. That changes the story, and likely policy responses, completely.\\n\\nAdditional examples in this category include all the stories about falling labor force participation rates (and similar statistics) that don’t adjust for the growing percent of retirees in the population. The labor force participation rate measures the percent of Americans 16 or older who are working or actively searching for a job. As life expectancy rises and the U.S. population contains a higher and higher share of retirees, the labor force participation is bound to decline since retirees by definition are not participating in the labor force. Basing policy decisions on such an economic statistic without adjusting for the increasing presence of retirees in the population could lead to serious policy missteps.\\n\\nThe second category of misleading economic statistics are lies based on comparisons across unequal groups or the wrong population.\\n\\nThe most famous example in this category is the famous disconnect between productivity and wages, often seen in the chart linked here and even referenced by politicians as famous as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). The chart shows productivity rising much faster than wages, making viewers think workers are being unfairly underpaid by evil employers. Yet it is all a lie because it compares the average productivity of all workers in the economy to the median wage of production and nonsupervisory employees. First, averages are pulled up by high values in the population being measured while medians are not, so they should not be compared to each other. Worse, the productivity measure in the chart is for all workers while the median wage is only for some workers. Missing from wages are people like software engineers and other high productivity workers who have done much over the past forty years to increase productivity. There is no reason at all why the pay of one group of workers should track with the productivity of a larger, more productive group.\\n\\nA similar apples to oranges common comparison is made when average worker pay is compared to CEO pay. There is nothing inherently wrong with such a comparison, but those making it to advance their agenda of fighting economic inequality typically present a ratio of pay for “average” workers to the earnings of CEOs of only the largest corporations in the country (say, the top 100 or 500 firms). In reality, as documented by Mark J. Perry and Michael Saltsman in the Wall Street Journal, if all CEOs are included, the average CEO is only paid about $180,000. That is still a nice paycheck, but far from the multimillions pulled in by the top few CEOs.\\n\\nA third category of lies built on economic statistics involves insufficient control for other factors that have influence on the relationship being claimed. These can range from small fibs because perfect control is difficult to huge whoppers when no attempt is made to correct for other factors well known to be important.\\n\\nA classic example of such lies are minimum wage studies that don’t account for other trends. For example, some studies have claimed raising the minimum wage increases does not reduce jobs because in cities or states that have raised the minimum wage, jobs in affected industries have still risen. What such studies often fail to account for is the preexisting trends in jobs. If a city that raises its minimum wage was adding 50,000 jobs per year in low-wage occupations before the wage hike and adds only 20,000 such jobs in the year after, that is evidence of lost jobs, not that minimum wage hikes cause no damage.\\n\\nSimilar examples of insufficient controls are found in the gender wage gap statistics that don’t account for differences in experience, education, and other similar factors that directly influence salary levels. The famous statistic of women earning $0.77 for every dollar men earn is exactly this sort of lie. It makes no attempt to correct for differences in experience, education, or even full versus part time status. Louis Jacobson of Politifact does a very nice job of walking a reader through different ways controls can be added that change that number, while also pointing out it can be a true statement as long as it doesn’t come with an implication this difference is due to discrimination against women working equivalent jobs.\\n\\nA fourth category of lies with economic statistics comes from cherry picking what to count. For example, many of the statistics about income inequality use pre-tax income and don’t include government benefits. Plus, they generally do count retirement accounts such as 401(k)s but don’t count the value of future Social Security, pension payments or home equity. These exclusions all bias the statistics in favor of making economic inequality look worse than it actually is.\\n\\nAnother example of this sort of cherry picking is when somebody touts a change in spending that doesn’t account for substitution effects. Most economic impact studies extolling the benefits of sports team and stadiums fall into this category, neglecting to account for the fact that the spending reported is simply reallocated from some other type of spending (perhaps on restaurants or movie tickets). A sports team moving to my town does not suddenly make me richer; to buy tickets I have to not buy something else. It is possible for a locality to gain by shifting spending from outside the region (as occurs from tourism and the convention business), but many studies do not confine themselves to such events.\\n\\nThe myth of student loan debt slowing the economy also falls in this category. Former students saddled with loan payments have less to spend on other things, but the lender who is receiving those payments now has more money to spend. Lending and repaying money does not hurt the economy, it just shifts who gets to spend money at a particular time, not the amount being spent.\\n\\nWhile I could go on, failure to account for changes in data definitions will be the final category of lies using economic statistics covered here. A perfect example is the claim that labor’s share of national income has fallen over time. As ably demonstrated by James Sherk, the statistics used to claim labor’s share of income has fallen neglect the fact government changed the way it allocates self-employment income. Roughly 80% of self-employment income used to be awarded to labor, with the remainder being counted as a return to the entrepreneurs’ capital. Since 2001, the BLS changed its procedure to be more a 50-50 split. While not the only problem with the statistics commonly used, with self-employment rising this change has a non-trivial effect on the statistic in question.\\n\\nHopefully, this column will make you a better-educated consumer of economic statistics, wary of claims backed up by the misuse or outright distortion of economic data. If you learn to recognize these categories of lies based on improperly employed or misinterpreted statistics, you will have a much easier time seeing through false claims and responding with precise criticism of the flaws in the economic statistics used to mislead people. With a little effort on the part of my readers, I hope this column will help reduce the amount of lies based on economic statistics that are leading to widely-held misperceptions about the economy and poor policy decisions.',\n",

       " 'Date: April 25th 2011\\n\\nI woke up really early today as I had to catch my AirPhil Express flight to Cebu at 7am. I checked out of my hotel and took a taxi from Pasay to the airport. It cost ₱70 ($1.6/€1.2) but I reached the airport in under 20 minutes and there were long queues because of the security checks. I checked in, got my window seat and whipped out my phone to take a few snaps.\\n\\nMy flight was unfortunately delayed by nearly 45 minutes due to poor weather conditions (apparently), but it was better than hearing some flights being cancelled, leaving passengers frustrated.\\n\\nI called Aimee and informed her about my arrival and she told me where to get a taxi from.\\n\\nI had reservations at Sugbutel Bed & Bath for two nights. I chose this place because, as per the map, it was close to the pier. I needed it to close to the pier because tomorrow morning, I was to go to the island of Bohol by ferry. But when I arrived at Sugbutel, I must say, I had the look of disappointment on my face. It was bang opposite the pier, sure, but there was little else around it. No restaurants and it didn’t look like it was within city limits. Anyway, I checked in, paid ₱700 ($16/€12) for my dorm bed for two nights and went upstairs.\\n\\nSince today was the only day I had to check out Cebu city, I wasted no time and took a jeepney straight to the first attraction on my list, Fort San Pedro.\\n\\nI felt it was a bit of a waste of money. Maybe it’s because I’ve seen countless forts, both in India and in other places like Malaysia. After a while, they all start to look the same.\\n\\nFerdinand Magellan was a famous Portugese explorer who became the first European to land in the Philippines. He ordered this cross be placed here signifying the arrival of the invaders explorers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I sat there, eating my burger, I wondered what to see next. It was only the afternoon and I… felt bored already. Maybe it was the lack of sleep. Anyway, I hopped on a jeepney and decided to go towards Robinsons Mall.\\n\\nI walked around some more, since I didn’t know what else to do.\\n\\nAfter converting some dollars at a nearby plaza, I got into another jeepney and decided to head towards the Philippine Taoist Temple.\\n\\nFrom the main road, I was instructed to cross over to a road on the other side.\\n\\nIt was only a short drive and the driver dropped me at a guarded entrance from where on, he told me, I would have to continue on by foot.\\n\\nThe bike taxis approached me again and asked me if I would like to go to a higher viewing spot, which was a bit further up from here. They said I could watch the sun set from there. I was honestly bored, so I said “No thanks” and just walked on.\\n\\nI stepped into a nearby mall, mostly to get some air-con. I dropped by a travel agency and asked them how much a tour to Bohol island tomorrow would cost. They quoted just over ₱3500 which I knew was exorbitant, since I did look it up online and had a fair idea as to how much the tours approximately cost.\\n\\nI messaged Aimee telling her I was bored in Cebu and she told me to go check out Ayala Mall. So I got into a jeepney and headed to Ayala.\\n\\n30 minutes of store-hopping, got bored (again) and left. I was pretty sleepy by now and decided to just take a taxi back to the pier instead of a jeepney.\\n\\nThe tour of Bohol when purchased from Supercat themselves cost around ₱2800. I opted not to buy the tour package and instead, decided to do it myself.\\n\\nI left the pier and walked back to the main road. As soon as I got to the main road in a minute, I realized why I booked at Sugbutel. You can literally walk to Supercat’s terminal from here.\\n\\nI dropped my camera bag back at the dorm and stepped out again wondering where I could have dinner. There are hardly any eateries outside Sugbutel.\\n\\nBut walk all the way up to the Radisson Hotel and right next to it is one big-ass mall!\\n\\nI walked back to Sugbutel, freshened up and hit the bed early. Tomorrow was going to be another early wake-up call.\\n\\nI know Cebu residents will be going “Oh, there’s more to Cebu than just these sights you saw!” and you’re probably right. Aimee told me if I headed up north in a vehicle, I could have explored the beaches and other sights Cebu has to offer. But I’m keeping all my “beach and sea” experiences for Palawan, which is why I only used Cebu as a stopover point to get to Bohol and then fly to Palawan.\\n\\nPrevious posts in this series:\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Day 8 – Manila tour: Rizal Park, Intramuros, Manila Cathedral, China Town\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Day 7 – Leaving Angeles City for Manila, Mall of Asia\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Day 6 – Good Friday in San Fernando, San Pedro Cutud Lenten Rites\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Leaving Sagada for Baguio, and arriving in Angeles city (Days 4 & 5)\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Day 3 – Sagada’s Lumiang burial cave, Sumaguing cave, Hanging Coffins of Echo valley\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Day 3 – Banaue town; heading to Sagada via Bontoc\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Day 2 – Banaue rice terraces; trekking to Batad village\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Day 1 — Manila American Cemetery and Memorial, Fort Bonifacio\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Flying over South China Sea for the first time\\n\\nOther posts in this series:\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Day 10 – Bohol tour: Chocolate Hills, Loboc river cruise, Tarsiers, churches\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Day 11 – Arriving in Puerto Princesa, Palawan\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Day 12 – Puerto Princesa Underground River tour, Palawan\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Day 13 – Puerto Princesa to El Nido by bus\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Day 14 – El Nido island hopping tour A and sunset at Las Cabanas beach, Palawan\\n\\nPhilippines 2011: Back to Manila, shopping, and my final thoughts about the country (Last post)',\n",

       " 'Tijuana Prisoner: I Was Forced To Dig Drug Tunnel To San Diego\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Special to NPR Special to NPR\\n\\nMore than 75 drug-smuggling tunnels have been discovered under the U.S.-Mexico border in just the past six years, and one of the more intriguing cases involves 17 Mexican men who claim they were kidnapped and forced to carry out the work for months before Mexican authorities found them.\\n\\nThere\\'s always been some mystery surrounding tunnels. Diggers were thought to be well-paid cartel loyalists or, as urban legend goes, laborers killed soon after the tunnel\\'s completion to ensure its secrecy.\\n\\nI met one of those 17 men who say they were kidnapped and forced to dig a tunnel last year. He says he was enslaved 35 feet below the border for months and lived to tell his side of the story — from a Tijuana prison.\\n\\nInside Prison\\n\\nHe was at Tijuana\\'s infamous La Mesa, one of the most overcrowded prisons in Mexico. Built for 2,600 prisoners, it now houses more than 7,000.\\n\\nHe and 16 other men have been there for a year, after being caught digging the underground tunnel.\\n\\nI waited for him in a small room next to the warden\\'s office. Earlier, the warden warned me not to ask too many probing questions. This is a delicate case, he said. It touches a lot of powerful people in the city.\\n\\nThe tunnels burrowing under Tijuana are thought to be built by Mexico\\'s most powerful drug organization, the Sinaloa cartel. The group, led by Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, is one of the few with the expertise and money — on average about $2 million — needed to build one of the underground wonders.\\n\\nAfter about 10 minutes, the guards escorted in a short man, dressed in the prison\\'s standard gray sweatpants and T-shirt. His hair was closely cropped. His accent was thick, like most rural farmers from Mexico\\'s northern states. He asked me if he\\'s in any danger if he tells me his story. I told him I really didn\\'t know; only he could weigh that risk. But I promised not to use his name.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Special to NPR Special to NPR\\n\\nHe started telling me his story. It began back in the winter of 2012, just four miles from this prison, in Tijuana\\'s Mesa de Otay neighborhood.\\n\\nHigh on a bluff hugging the international border and the huge commercial crossing into San Diego, Mesa de Otay bustles with activity. Eighteen-wheelers barrel down the wide streets, packed with everything from TVs to small medical devices assembled in Tijuana\\'s foreign-owned factories. Warehouses line the dusty boulevards — some have signs; others don\\'t even have a street number on their door fronts.\\n\\nThe warehouse where the tunnel digger was found is about a quarter of a mile from the border. He says he was brought to it in November 2012. The warehouse is abandoned now, and it still has crime-scene tape and a padlock on the front door. With all the truck traffic here, you could imagine how loud noises coming from inside the building, or deep underground, would be masked.\\n\\nThe tunnel digger said he was tricked into going there. He was working day jobs in a border town until he had a fight with his wife. He picked up and left and decided to head north to San Diego for a while, to cool off and make some money. He had made the illegal trip many times before. He rented a room in a rough neighborhood in Tijuana known as a reliable place to find a smuggler.\\n\\n\"I was drinking a soda at this little store in front of the room I was renting, and this guy, who I had talked with a few times before, drives by,\" the tunnel digger said in Spanish.\\n\\nThe other man said he had found a smuggler. He said he could show the tunnel digger the safe house so he would know where to go.\\n\\nThe tunnel digger climbed in the vehicle. But he said the man — identified in court documents only as Carlillos — took him to a warehouse, not a home.\\n\\n\"Someone rolled up the huge metal door and we drove in. A pickup truck pulled in behind us, and then I heard the door come down,\" he said.\\n\\nHe said six men with ski masks and rifles jumped out of the truck.\\n\\n\"They threw me to the ground and started beating me up, threatening me. I wanted to run, but there was nowhere to go,\" he said. \"They told me what I was going to do, and if I didn\\'t, they would kill me.\"\\n\\nSan Diego Warehouses: The Exit Door\\n\\nJust over the border fence in San Diego sit hundreds of warehouses. Federal officials have found the exit doors for Tijuana\\'s tunnels tucked into back offices and even in bathrooms.\\n\\nJoe Garcia is a federal agent on San Diego\\'s Tunnel Task Force. His group has discovered some of the biggest underground passageways in the region, including last year\\'s so-called supertunnel, which stretched 600 yards. Eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and more than 300 pounds of cocaine were stuffed inside. Garcia says the tunnels are sophisticated and quite a feat to dig without heavy machinery, which is too noisy and too big for the narrow passageways.\\n\\n\"It\\'s good old-fashioned, hard, manual labor,\" he said. \"These guys are filling buckets or sandbags of earth and are moving them either completely out or putting them somewhere else in the tunnel. It is hard, hard work.\"\\n\\nWhere Tunnels Have Been Found Mexican authorities received tips that led them to two tunnels headed from Tijuana to the U.S. border in San Diego. This story looks at the tunnel found on Feb. 4, 2013.\\n\\n12-Hour Shifts\\n\\nThe tunnel digger said they worked in 12-hour shifts, from 6 to 6. He said he worked the night shift with six others.\\n\\n\"There was this red laser beam we had to follow, right down the middle,\" he said. \"If we went crooked or off a bit, the men with the ski masks would come down and beat us. We had to dig 3 meters every day. If we didn\\'t, they told us we were lazy and beat us.\"\\n\\nThe digger said he never saw anyone\\'s face except Carlillos\\' and that of the man who brought them food. Some days the man with the food didn\\'t come.\\n\\nAfter two months, they had dug about 200 yards, and it was getting harder to breathe in the tunnel. The men in the ski masks brought in tubing and pumped in oxygen.\\n\\nIt was nearly February. At that rate, the tunnel would reach a San Diego warehouse in plenty of time before Baja, California\\'s marijuana harvest was ready to pick.\\n\\nJose Mario Vega Hernandez of Mexico\\'s defense department said an anonymous tip led authorities to the tunnel on Feb. 4, 2013.\\n\\nThe tunnel digger said he was so happy to see them. The men rushed to thank the soldiers and said they were being held against their will.\\n\\nHe said the soldiers told them to be quiet and forced them to the ground.

       " 'Svetlana Alexievich, the Belarusian author who won the 2015 Nobel Prize in literature, says she wants to use the spotlight cast on her by the award to try to spark a \"revolution in the minds of people.\"\\n\\n“I believe resistance is needed,” Alexievich told RFE/RL’s Russian Service in an interview, when asked whether change was possible in Russia under President Vladimir Putin or Belarus under President Alyaksandr Lukashenka -- two authoritarian leaders who have controlled their countries for years.\\n\\nNearly a quarter-century after the 1991 collapse of the communist Soviet Union, Alexievich suggested that a shift in people\\'s mindsets would remove the biggest roadblock to change in her native region and worldwide.\\n\\n\"But I don’t mean running to the barricades and shooting. I’m no supporter of revolutions because never in history have they led to anything other than bloodshed,\" she said in the interview. \"I think we do need a revolution, but in the minds of people.\"\\n\\n“War should have long ago been equated with cannibalism,\" Alexievich said in the wide-ranging interview. \"In the 21st century, mankind still resolves its conflicts the same way it did when people wore animal skins. The only difference is that in the past they killed with clubs, and today with weapons of mass destruction.\"\\n\\nA tenacious critic of totalitarianism, Alexievich has written about events that had an impact on Belarus in the 20th century, including the Nazi occupation, the Chornobyl nuclear disaster, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\\n\\nThe Swedish Academy awarded the author and journalist the Nobel Prize, calling her works “a monument to suffering and courage in our time.\"\\n\\nNone of her work, written in Russian, has been published in Belarus since Lukashenka came to power in 1994.\\n\\nLukashenka first congratulated Alexievich, a loud and persistent critic of the Belarus leader, after the prize was announced on October 8. However, Lukashenka later questioned her patriotism after Alexievich lobbed criticism at his regime.\\n\\n\"Some of our \\'artists,\\' creative individuals, even Nobel Prize winners...went abroad and tried to pour a bucket of dirt over their country,” Lukashenka said in late October.\\n\\nThe 67-year-old Alexievich, who was born in Soviet Ukraine to a Belarusian father and a Ukrainian mother, said that such sniping would do nobody any good back home in Belarus.\\n\\n“As far as Lukashenka goes, I am truly sorry that at a very difficult time for Belarus we are not talking about what is important,\" she said. \"Two people who hold some form of symbolic capital should give their people hope, rather than quarrelling in public.”\\n\\nAsked whether she thought writers like herself could have any influence on Lukashenka -- dubbed \"Europe’s last dictator\" by some critics -- Alexievich was unsure, but not upbeat.\\n\\n“I’m not even sure literature can influence politicians today. Unfortunately, that time has passed. At the same time, however, all politicians depend on us. If they are genuine politicians, then they will hear where they are and with whom,” she said.\\n\\nShifting gears, Alexievich voiced strong admiration for Nadia Savchenko, the Ukrainian military pilot on trial in Russia on charges of involvement in what Russian authorities describe as the \"murder\" of two Russian journalists covering the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\\n\\nSavchenko served in a volunteer battalion fighting against Russia-backed separatists. She is accused by Russian authorities of providing the coordinates for a mortar attack that killed the two journalists in 2014.\\n\\nSavchenko and her backers say that the charges are false and that she was abducted and illegally transferred to Russia for prosecution. Rights groups and Western government have called for her release.\\n\\n“Of course, Nadia knows a lot more about war than I, although I’ve listened to hundreds of stories about war, and was present myself during the [Soviet] war in Afghanistan. That war, which I witnessed, was in no way as dramatic, or intense, as what Nadia has experienced,” said Alexievich, whose first novel, War\\'s Unwomanly Face, is based on previously untold stories of women who fought against Nazi Germany in World War II.\\n\\nAlexievich said the court in the southern Russian city of Rostov is not only prosecuting Savchenko for defending her country but for being a strong woman.\\n\\n“Nadia is a very strong, a very compelling person, a very unusual woman -- unusual for our time. And for that, they are persecuting her. Men who can’t stand to see a woman equal to them or ever higher. There is no evidence whatsoever of her guilt. She is only guilty of defending her homeland,” Alexievich says.\\n\\nAlexievich vowed to press Savchenko’s case \"from every street corner\" and sign every petition demanding her release, although she does so with “despair and a feeling of helplessness.”\\n\\n\"You can be a three-time Nobel winner and still be unable to change the most primitive human behavior, the most primitive political beliefs,\" Alexievich says.\\n\\nHowever, Alexievich says standing up for people like Savchenko is crucial to ultimately bring about that sea change in people’s minds.\\n\\n“By doing that, we save ourselves, and preserve the dignity of those we stand by. They feel they are not alone,\" she said. \"We can only grow, expand as a group, and show them that we are not few in number.”\\n\\nWritten by RFE/RL’s Tony Wesolowsky based on an interview by Andrei Shary of RFE/RL’s Russian Service',\n",

Congress was gearing up to put up a tough fight in Antagarh (ST), where polling is scheduled for September 13, the first bypoll after BJP government retained power for the third consecutive time in assembly polls last year.Kanker district collector Alermelmangai D confirmed the development and Pawar could not be reached for comment.Opposition Congress alleged ruling BJP was behind Pawar's vanishing act, but maintained the party would make a statement once it got to the bottom of the issue.Pawar was a legislator between 1998 and 2003 ? in undivided Madhya Pradesh and later Chhattisgarh. In the 2008 and 2013 polls, he lost to BJP's Vikram Usendi. In 2008, Usendi managed a narrow win by just 109 votes while in 2013 his margin significantly rose to more than 5,000 votes.Bypoll to Antagarh (ST) seat was necessitated following resignation of Vikram Usendi from the Vidhan Sabha consequent to his election to the Lok Sabha in May this year.As many as 14 candidates filed their nomination for the bypoll and an independent candidate's papers were rejected during scrutiny.

Critics fear this influence would be severely diluted if the number of associations is dramatically cut.\\n\\nAfter the longlist is reduced to two candidates, all Conservative members get a vote to determine who is elected leader.\\n\\nInsiders believe that the existence of as few as 60 \"super-associations\" would make members significantly easier to control.\\n\\nIt could also reduce the influence of rural Tories because they would subsumed into larger associations which could include members from large towns and cities.\\n\\nThe plans will be presented to the party’s ruling board today by Lord Feldman, the party’s chairman. If approved, they could be in place within 12 months.\\n\\nPhoto: Matt Cardy/Getty Images\\n\\nParty sources insist the changes are voluntary and subject to vote of members before they are rolled out through on a region by region basis.\\n\\nHowever, it would be possible for individual associations which reject the changes to be overruled if a majority in a county area supports the changes.\\n\\nEd Costelloe, chairman of Grassroots Conservatives, said: “It means that MPs are more beholden to CCHQ and I think that is a diabolical thing.”\\n\\nJohn Strafford, chairman of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy and a party member for 50 years, added: “The way they are going, they are signing the death warrant of the Conservative party as a membership organisation.”\\n\\nA Conservative spokesman said: “The plan is to offer constituency Associations the option to form multi-constituency associations so they can benefit from shared offices and access to professional staff.\\n\\n“Multi-constituency associations can only be formed by a vote of Party Members in those constituencies – nothing is being ‘axed’.”',\n",
       " 'There is a logical way to think about governance -- one that was shared by the key Framers of the U.S. Constitution -- that the federal government should have sufficient authority to do what is necessary to fulfill the goals that the document laid out about promoting the general welfare and protecting the nation.\\n\\nPut differently, the actual \"originalist\" thinking behind the Constitution was what might be called \"pragmatic nationalism,\" not what today\\'s Right tries to pretend it was, an ideological commitment to a tightly constrained federal government hemmed in by a strong system of \"states\\' rights.\"\\n\\nIn other words, the Right\\'s modern interpretation of the Founding Principles was not shared by the key Framers of the Constitution. Instead, the Right\\'s position on the Constitution apes the opposition to the Constitution by the Anti-Federalists, who warned that the new federal structure would subordinate the states to the central government and endanger slavery. Indeed, the \"original\" thinking behind the Constitution was almost the opposite of the right-wing canard. The key Framers -- George Washington, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and Gouverneur Morris (who authored the famous Preamble) -- all believed that a vibrant federal government was needed to control the squabbling states which had pushed the new country to the brink of disaster under the Articles of Confederation.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nDespite that real history, today\\'s Right has largely succeeded in distorting the Founding Narrative to convince vast numbers of lightly educated Americans that -- by joining with the Tea Party -- they are defending the Constitution as the Framers devised it when, in reality, they are channeling the views of those who fiercely opposed the Constitution.\\n\\nThis historical issue is important because as the empirical case for \"small government\" ideology collapses -- amid failures of \"supply-side economics,\" austerity in the face of recession, \"free-market\" extremism that let the banks run wild, anti-scientific stances denying global warming, etc. -- all the right-wingers have left is this claim they are upholding the Framers\\' original vision, an emotional tug on many Americans who dress up in Revolutionary War costumes and unfurl yellow flags with a coiled snake saying: \"Don\\'t Tread on Me.\"\\n\\nYet, the reality is that key drafters of the Constitution were staunch advocates of a strong central government invested with all the necessary powers to build a young nation and to protect its hard-won independence. Article One, Section Eight authorized a series of powers, including to \"provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States\" and \"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.\"\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nIn Federalist Paper 44, Madison expounded on what has become known as the \"elastic clause,\" writing: \"No axiom is more clearly established in law, or in reason, than that wherever the power to do a thing is given, every particular power necessary for doing it, is included.\"\\n\\nAt the time of the Constitutional Convention, Madison favored even a greater concentration of power in the central government, wanting to give Congress the authority to veto state laws, a proposal that was watered-down into declaring federal statutes the supreme law of the land and giving federal courts the power to judge state laws unconstitutional.\\n\\n\"They\\'ll Free Your Niggers!\"\\n\\nSo, today\\'s Tea Partiers, \"libertarians\" and the Republican Right are not so much descendants of the Framers as they are heirs to the Anti-Federalists who tried to strangle the U.S. Constitution in its cradle. And a principal motive for this fierce opposition was a desire to protect slavery.\\n\\nLed by pro-slavery Southerners like Patrick Henry and George Mason, the Anti-Federalists warned that the Constitution would concentrate so much power in the federal government that it would lead inexorably to the eradication of slavery.\\n\\nIn battling the Constitution\\'s ratification in 1788, Patrick Henry warned his fellow Virginians that if they approved the Constitution, it would put their massive capital investment in slaves in jeopardy. Imagining the possibility of a federal tax on slaveholding, Henry declared, \"They\\'ll free your niggers!\"\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nIt is a testament to how we have whitewashed U.S. history on the evils of slavery that Patrick Henry is far better known for his declaration before the Revolution, \"Give me liberty or give me death!\" than his equally pithy warning, \"They\\'ll free your niggers!\"\\n\\nSimilarly, George Mason, Henry\\'s collaborator in trying to scare Virginia\\'s slaveholders into opposing the Constitution, is recalled as an instigator of the Bill of Rights, rather than as a defender of slavery. A key \"freedom\" that Henry and Mason fretted about was the \"freedom\" of plantation owners to possess other human beings as property.\\n\\nAs historians Andrew Burstein and Nancy Isenberg wrote in their 2010 book, Madison and Jefferson, the hot button for Henry and Mason was that \"slavery, the source of Virginia\\'s tremendous wealth, lay politically unprotected.\" Besides the worry about how the federal government might tax slave-ownership, there was the fear that the President -- as the nation\\'s commander in chief under the new Constitution -- might \"federalize\" the state militias and emancipate the slaves.\\n\\n\"Mason repeated what he had said during the Constitutional Convention: that the new government failed to provide for \"domestic safety\" if there was no explicit protection for Virginians\\' slave property,\" Burstein and Isenberg wrote. \"Henry called up the by-now-ingrained fear of slave insurrections -- the direct result, he believed, of Virginia\\'s loss of authority over its own militia.\"',\n",

The Bat Bomb\\n\\nWikimedia Commons\\n\\nDeveloped by the US for use against Japan during World War II, the bat bomb was literally that. Each bomb would contain 40 hibernating bats, each of which would be strapped with a small napalm bomb and a timer.\\n\\nThe bombs could deploy their own parachutes, giving the bats time to fly out and look for places to roost. They would then explode, potentially burning down whatever structure they had chosen as their new home.\\n\\n2. Anti-Tank Dogs\\n\\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:F_ww2_sov16.jpg The Nazi betrayal of the Soviets during World War II caught the Russians completely off guard. In a desperate attempt at staving off the Nazi advance into their territory, the Soviets strapped dogs with explosives and trained them to run under German tanks.\\n\\nSoviet propaganda claims that around 300 German tanks were destroyed in this manner. The anti-tank dog program continued until 1996.\\n\\n3. Submarine Aircraft Carriers\\n\\nJapanese Navy At the height of World War II, the Imperial Japanese Navy commissioned a series of Sen Toku I-400 class submarines. These subs were large enough to carry three Aichi M6A Seiran aircraft underwater, surface and launch the planes, and then dive again. The submarines were also equipped with torpedoes.\\n\\nA total of three of them were completed.\\n\\n4. Nuclear Artillery\\n\\nUS Department Of Energy\\n\\nConventional nuclear weapons are capable of destroying entire cities, but during the Cold War, the idea of \\'tactical\\' nuclear weapons emerged. These smaller nukes were limited-yield weapons that would be launched from the ground at targets on the battlefield. Nuclear artillery was delivered with shells and short-range rockets.\\n\\n5. The Soviet Ekranoplane\\n\\nIgor 113\\n\\nThe 300-foot-long Lun-class Ekranoplane flew a mere four meters above the ground or water through an effect generated by its wings. It was intended to be a revolutionary transport vessel, bigger than any plane and faster than any ship. It was also capable of carrying nuclear warheads.\\n\\nBut it never entered into wide production and was never used in action.\\n\\n6.

These torpedoes were manned and were a variant of the suicide weapons that Japan resorted to towards the end of the war. The torpedoes were launched from submarines and the pilots of the torpedoes could steer the weapons as necessary to inflict maximum damage against an enemy.\\n\\n7. Pigeon-Guided Missiles\\n\\nDepartment of Defense\\n\\nPigeon-guided missiles were developed by noted behaviorist B.F. Skinner during Project Pigeon. Although the project was ultimately cancelled because of the impracticality of the weapons, the idea of pigeon-guided missiles showed promise.\\n\\nThe missile had an array of lenses at the front that projected an image of the target to an interior screen.

Residents did not immediately embrace me — a student filmmaker.

While many communities seem to confer on their residents a sense of stability, those at the employee parking lot today generally view their homes as temporary. But if a home is traditionally considered a place where one yearns to return to — a place where the heart is, so to speak — can a temporary dwelling be a home?\\n\\nTheir perspectives are rooted in their community’s complicated history. The lot was created at least a decade ago as an airport-sponsored program offering airline employees a place to rest before heading to their next destination. Today, however, the next destination for many of the lot’s residents is unknown. As a result of pursuing their dream of working in the aviation industry, with its attendant transient lifestyle, many of the parking lot’s residents are estranged from their families. They are largely a community of people living alone, together — and most now consider the lot “home.” But airport officials do not necessarily share their enthusiasm. Instead, they are actively seeking ways to re-appropriate the space where the community is situated and have slowly, and steadily, reduced the number of its residents.',\n",

       " 'Scientists on \\'strangest continent\\' Antarctica investigate effect of climate change on animals\\n\\nUpdated\\n\\nKing George Island is a remote speck of ice-covered mountains at the far north of the Antarctic Peninsula. It is also the nearest thing in Antarctica to an accessible destination.\\n\\nEvery summer, hundreds of scientists fly down from the bottom of South America to the island\\'s gravel runway operated by the Chilean Air Force.\\n\\nThere are bases from 14 countries, including Chile, China, Russia, the US and South Korea. It is also a logistical hub for expeditions to the peninsula and the West Antarctic ice shelf.\\n\\nEven with the extreme cold, frequent storms and constant stench of penguin poo, it is paradise for scientists.\\n\\n\"It\\'s an extremely good place for science, everyone calls it a natural laboratory,\" a beaming Professor Peter Convey tells me as we stand shivering at the airport.\\n\\nA senior scientist with the British Antarctic Survey, he is relishing his 17th season on the ice.\\n\\nForeign Correspondent was given a rare opportunity to travel around the island, couch-surfing the crowded bases and joining expeditions by foot and on zodiac boats.\\n\\nThe large number of international bases has created an Antarctic community with a small town, a school, a post office and, most extraordinary of all, a traditional Russian Orthodox Church above the former Soviet base of Bellingshausen.\\n\\nBefore scientists came, nobody imagined the island could be settled and all food and equipment still has to be shipped or flown in.\\n\\nBut the residents thrive in the hostile conditions and see their work as vitally important.\\n\\nKing George Island is not just a \"natural laboratory\" - it is one of the most extreme hot spots for global warming.\\n\\nAccording to the British Antarctic Survey, the average annual temperature on the peninsula has risen 2.8 degrees Celsius in 50 years, the biggest rise in the southern hemisphere.\\n\\nChanges over 30 years are regarded as \"statistically significant\", showing a clear trend in the climate beyond the variability of weather.\\n\\nAs bases were set up on the island after World War II, there is a huge body of \"statistically significant\" research to draw on.\\n\\nThe Collins Glacier opposite the airport, for example, has retreated 1.7 kilometres in 60 years.\\n\\nSceptics will rightly point out that glaciers are always advancing or retreating, but there is no doubting the trend.\\n\\nOver the past 50 years, 87 per cent of the island\\'s glaciers have retreated.\\n\\n\"That is a direct consequence of the regional warming,\" Professor Convey said.\\n\\n\"The past few decades of warming are very exceptional compared to any natural variation over a multi-thousand year time scale, at least if not multi-hundred thousand year timescale.\"\\n\\nKing George Island native penguins disappearing, moving south\\n\\nThe effect of rising temperatures on wildlife is already apparent. We joined a group of German biologists studying why the island\\'s native penguins, Adelies, are disappearing.\\n\\nBiologist Hans Ulrich-Peter told us that Adelies were heading south in search of their main food source, krill.\\n\\nKrill feed on phytoplankton under sea ice, but the ice is either forming late or not at all.\\n\\nScientists working in the field in Antarctica are united in their conclusions that anthropogenic climate change is real and a cause for international concern.\\n\\nTheir research is part of the basis on which the UN\\'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the IPCC) has \"a high degree of certainty\" that most of the temperature rise has been caused by human activity.\\n\\nBut that is hotly disputed by a small, vocal group of contrarians working in Western research institutes and conservative think tanks.\\n\\nWillie Soon, a solar researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, has called the IPCC \"a pure bully\" engaging in \"blatant manipulations of fact\".\\n\\nIt remains to be seen which side will be taken more seriously at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December, where nations will be asked to set future limits on emissions to avoid a global temperature rise of two degrees above pre-industrial times.\\n\\nIn Antarctica, scientists insist they leave politics to the politicians.\\n\\nBut the frustration at being accused of fabricating evidence is palpable.\\n\\n\"The people doing the criticising, if they were looking into a mirror, are far more open to that criticism,\" Mr Convey said.\\n\\nEric Campbell\\'s report on King George Island airs on Tuesday at 8:00pm.\\n\\nTopics: climate-change, environment, antarctica\\n\\nFirst posted',\n",

       " 'We’ve already seen how Apple is presenting the upcoming Apple Watch, which it calls its most personal device yet, as not just another technology device but also a piece of jewelry that the fashion world will be proud to embrace.\\n\\n9to5Mac has now learned from internal hiring documents that Apple is recruiting retail candidates this month with “a fashion or luxury background” suggesting Apple is preparing to deliver some changes to its retail stores in time for the Apple Watch’s early 2015 debut. With former Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts leading Apple’s retail efforts and the Apple Watch set to transform the Apple Store into a jewelry store, what could a potential Apple Store makeover include?\\n\\nAside from beefing up on how much of its staff is well versed in fashion and luxury lingo, there’s potential for greater changes in 2015 for Apple’s retail stores as it presents the Apple Watch to the world.\\n\\nFor starters, there are an awful lot of Apple Watches from which to choose. Apple has admitted as much while highlighting the personalization that is necessary for a successful wearable device. Back in October, Apple SVP of Design Jony Ive described the need for various appearances of the Apple Watch when speaking at San Francisco’s Museum of Modern Art:\\n\\nAs soon as something is worn, we have expectations of choice,” said Ive. Only “in prison,” he joked, do people all wear the same thing.\\n\\nWhile that’s a win for potential buyers wanting an Apple Watch that reflects their style, it also means the Apple Watch will require a greater footprint in the Apple Store than if the Apple Watch was only available in three colors.\\n\\nIn the case of the Apple Watch, options include sizes in 38mm and 42mm, finishes of stainless steel, space black stainless steel, silver aluminum, space gray aluminum, 18-karat yellow gold, and 18-karat rose gold with six different band styles all available in various color options as well.\\n\\nAs Apple has shown off the Apple Watch at its announcement event and at Colette, we’ve seen one possible approach Apple could take at its retail stores to presenting the various Apple Watch collections to consumers: behind glass in Apple Store-style tables.\\n\\nWe first saw these tables holding Apple Watches in September from the press and employee “hands-on” area after the iPhone/Watch event.\\n\\nWhile this style of presentation seems to address the presentation problem, shoppers will also want to try on the various Apple Watch styles and interact with the software, and from the looks of today’s hiring news, it sounds like Apple wants to do this right.\\n\\nOne could imagine a display similar to the ones in the photos above with easy access for Apple Store employees to remove specific Apple Watches for trying on. Such an effort would require more staffing, but the approach might be more secure than simply anchoring Apple Watch’s to alarm systems like iPhones and iPads on display in Apple Stores.\\n\\nTo tackle the teaching angle, Apple could leverage ongoing demonstrations at dedicated tables to continuously talk about the Apple Watch and its various features.\\n\\nApple has saved announcing the exact price range of the various Apple Watch models (only officially sharing that it will begin at $350), but some reports believe Apple’s gold “Edition” version could retail for several thousand dollars. While Apple already sells iMacs and Mac Pros priced at several thousand dollars, you’re not walking out with one on in your pocket or on your wrist even if you ignore the alarm system.\\n\\nPerhaps Apple will present the lesser priced Apple Watches on the floor for most customers to try on (with anchored alarms) and save the much higher priced versions for trying on by request under supervision. Pricing will be important here as the luxury-priced materials could understandably warrant a different approach to displaying the Apple Watch.\\n\\nRegardless of how Apple presents the more expensive Apple Watch collections, and today’s hiring news certainly suggests it will take an approach similar to other luxury brand retailers, you can almost certainly expect Apple’s approach to have its own unique spin that differs from any existing jewelry retailer already in business.\\n\\nAside from recruiting retail staff with experience in luxury and fashion, Apple has had its upcoming Watch highlighted by the cover of Vogue China and Vogue’s editor Anna Wintour and CEO of Colette present at the Apple Watch appearance at Fashion Week in Paris.\\n\\nAngela Ahrendts already tipped her hand that the Apple Watch will be hitting retail in the “spring” which may come later than what others deciphered from Apple’s “early 2015” promise, but in the meantime today’s recruitment news let’s us know that Apple is preparing for a bigger change at its stores as it readies for presenting itself as a luxury retailer more so than ever before.',\n",

       " 'Donald Trump continued to push the contentious issue of Ted Cruz’s presidential eligibility on Friday, threatening that he has legal standing to sue Cruz for not being a “natural born citizen.”\\n\\n“If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen,” Trump posted on Twitter.\\n\\nDoes Trump really have grounds to sue Cruz? According to some legal experts, the answer is yes, but they’re divided on how a court would handle such a claim. The real estate mogul has previously raised questions about whether Cruz’s Canadian birth disqualifies him from being considered a natural born citizen, warning that Democrats might file a lawsuit to dispute Cruz’s presidential eligibility. Some voters have already filed suits against Cruz, but experts tend to agree that a suit filed by a rival candidate, such as Trump, would hold more weight.\\n\\n“For standing, you have to have injury, and his injury would be that he could quite possibly lose votes that would go to Cruz that might’ve gone to him,” said Mary Brigid McManamon, a constitutional law professor at Delaware Law School. She said a voter’s claim is less significant because their injury is the same as that of everyone in the state.\\n\\nHarvard law professor Laurence Tribe said Trump’s standing is plausible but not legally guaranteed.\\n\\n“Its plausibility gets greater the closer we get to the point where it’s clear that Cruz himself (and not Cruz together with Bush, Kasich, Rubio, and perhaps others) is the real obstacle to Trump’s nomination and thus a clear source of concrete injury to Trump’s prospects for the Republican presidential nomination,” Tribe said in an email.\\n\\nBoth McManamon and Tribe have argued that Cruz is not a natural born citizen based on a strict interpretation of the Constitution and is, therefore, not eligible to be president. McManamon said Trump should win a suit if he chooses to bring one, but she’s cautious about predicting what a court would do.\\n\\n“It would be interesting to see if a court would actually take it,” she said. “They really don’t want to be in the middle of a political hot potato.”\\n\\nJonathan Adler, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University, is skeptical that a court would touch the issue at all. He said Trump would likely file a suit in one state to try to get Cruz excluded from that state’s ballot.\\n\\n“Whether or not he would have standing would ultimately depend on that state’s rules,” Adler said. “There are some courts who might say this is really a question for voters to determine.”\\n\\nAdler, who has argued that Cruz is a natural born citizen, said he doesn’t see any basis for a claim brought in federal court, but he thinks Trump could argue injury at the state level.\\n\\n“Trump has at least a more plausible claim of injury because he can claim that he lost votes because of one erroneous decision on ballot eligibility,” Adler said, adding that he doesn’t expect a suit would get very far.\\n\\n“I happen to think that the best arguments on the merits support Cruz’s eligibility, but even apart from that, I just don’t see courts intervening on this sort of thing,” Adler said, noting that Trump would be fighting an uphill battle. “I mean, he’s done crazier things, so we’ll see.”\\n\\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.',\n",

       " 'The Pentagon’s Joint Staff and the Defense Intelligence Agency have been providing intelligence support to the Iraqis for the past two years, American officials said, but there has not yet been a fight to match the size and scope of the battle to retake Mosul, where half of the city’s previous population of two million still resides.\\n\\nThe American-led coalition must be able to offer intelligence support in the Mosul operation to more partner forces — including the Iraqi Army, counterterrorism service and police, as well as Kurdish pesh merga fighters — than in any previous operations to retake other cities.\\n\\nAs a result, in the military’s most recent deployment of more than 600 additional troops, dozens of military and civilian intelligence analysts were dispatched to several locations around Iraq. Most were in place just before the Mosul offensive began, but some are still trickling in.\\n\\n“Whenever you liberate a city the size of Mosul, you can expect to get a tremendous amount of information,” said Col. John L. Dorrian, the chief American military spokesman in Baghdad. “Certainly, if we have a window of opportunity that presents itself rather quickly, we do have adequate forces in theater to go ahead and act upon that.”\\n\\nThe intelligence surge would most likely “give us a lot of insight into Daesh networks not just in Iraq and Syria, but it also gives insight into how they export terror around the world, some of the people they work with, how they finance themselves,” Colonel Dorrian said.\\n\\nThat is important because even as the Islamic State loses its physical caliphate, or religious state, in Iraq and Syria, the group can still inflict deadly assaults, senior American counterterrorism officials say. “It’s our judgment that ISIL’s capacity and ability today to carry out attacks in Syria and Iraq and abroad has not thus far been significantly diminished,” Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told Congress last month. “The tempo of ISIL-linked terrorist attacks and terrorist activity in Europe and other places around the globe is a reminder of that global reach.”\\n\\n“This external operations capability has been building and entrenching over the past two years,” he warned, “and we don’t think that battlefield or territorial losses alone will be sufficient to completely degrade the group’s terrorism capabilities.”',\n",

       " 'I usually go for a top 5 list. But I couldn’t find 5 scary movies this year so far. Even though I liked movies like “Cabin in the Woods’ and “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter’, those are just not good enough to scare people. So here are the 3 scariest movies that can keep you awake at night.\\n\\n01. The Woman in Black\\n\\nThe Woman in Black is a ghost movie and I consider it’s a must watch movie released in 2012. It’s a story about a little village terrorized by a dead woman who’s seeking for revenge of her son’s death. This movie has tested my limits. I did my best to keep my mouth shut while watching it and not to think about it when I wake up middle of the night. It was that scary, so far the best scary movie this year. It’ll surely freak you out. I won’t go into details much. I’ll just let you watch and enjoy it. It’s a movie worth watching. I don’t like how it ended though. But combination of dark moving backgrounds and music will test your limits. Great performances by “Harry Potter”\\x9d star Daniel Radcliffe.\\n\\nPlot: A young lawyer travels to a remote village where he discovers the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.\\n\\n02. The Devil Inside\\n\\nThe Devil Inside is another creepy movie released earlier this year. It’s a documentary style movie. I normally hate documentary movies. But there’s something in this movie that kept me interested. I hear lots of negative reviews about it. But movie was not disappointing. Sure it was a low-budget movie. But in my opinion, it’s scary enough to be in second on this list. It’s a story about demons taking control over human bodies. Honestly I believe these stuff. In my society, we have special methods to treat these people, which often involved with sacrificing of chickens in exchange of human body (Basically making a deal with demon). The Devil Inside also doesn’t have the greatest ending. But it’s worth watching. You have to be a believer to enjoy it to its full capacity.\\n\\nPlot: In Italy, a woman becomes involved in a series of unauthorized exorcism during her mission to discover what happened to her mother, who allegedly murdered three people during her own exorcism.\\n\\n03. Chernobyl Diaries\\n\\nChernobyl Diaries is another movie worth watching. I can’t say it’ll scare you to hell. But it has its moments to scare you. It has a good storyline. It’s about 3 tourist couples going for an adventure on an abandoned city near Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. They have been told that everyone lived there were left 25 years ago. But they soon find out that they are stuck in the city and not everyone has left 25 years ago. Stage is set for a great horror by halfway of the movie, but it never happened in the end. It leaves unanswered questions and ending didn’t amuse me. Plus, you never get a good look at things that are killing these people. Movie is good enough to be in this list. But it could have been a better movie.\\n\\nPlot: Six tourists hire an extreme tour guide who takes them to the abandoned city Pripyat, the former home to the workers of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. During their exploration, they soon discover they are not alone.\\n\\nThese are my favorites so far this year. Although none of it ended the way I liked. It’s becoming the nature of this genre. None of these movies has disgusting scenes or sex on it. So if you’re looking for those this is not the list for you. You may consider “Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning”\\x9d. So enjoy and be scared. Watch out for dogs if you’re watching The Devil Inside.',\n",

Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle\\n\\nPerched at almost 15,000 feet, the Indian Astronomical Observatory at Hanle (in Ladakh) has always made Indian scientists proud. Remotely operated by the astronomers from Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) in Bangalore, it is the second-highest observatory in the world and has the 2m class Chandra telescope.\\n\\nClear, cloudless skies throughout the year and very little artificial light makes this an ideal location for astronomical observation. No wonder the outputs of this observatory have been used by Indian scientists to publish over 120 papers that have helped astronomers all over the world.\\n\\n2. Vainu Bappu Observatory, Kavalur\\n\\nAnother astronomical observatory owned and operated by Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Vainu Bappu Observatory is home to the Vainu Bappu Telescope, which was the largest telescope in Asia until a 3.6 meter telescope was set up at Nainital’s ARIES observatory in 2016.\\n\\nNamed in honour of M.K. Vainu Bappu, (famous astronomer and former director of the Kodaikanal Observatory), this thimble-shaped observatory is located at Kavalur, a small village nestled within the verdant sandalwood forests of Javadi Hills in Tamil Nadu.\\n\\nYou May Like: This Couple’s Stunning Documentaries Are Taking Space Dreams to Rural Kids in India\\n\\n3. Kodaikanal Solar Observatory\\n\\nThe Kodai Solar Observatory, run by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics in Tamil Nadu, is located on the southern tip of the Palni Hills in Tamil Nadu. It’s among the only two observatories in the world (the other one is in USA) that has over 100 years of data on the sun and its influence on Earth and surrounding space.\\n\\nInterestingly, the job of preserving daily records at the observatory has been performed by the same family for generations. Every day, 55-year-old Devendra P walks uphill to the observatory to position the telescope and take photographs, just like his father and his grandfather used to in their time.\\n\\n4. Ooty Radio Telescope, Ooty\\n\\nDesigned and made completely in India, Ooty Radio telescope continues to be one of the most sensitive radio telescopes in the world. A 1,740-foot-long and 98-foot-wide cylindrical paraboloid telescope, it is a part of the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), under the ambit of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR).\\n\\nThe observatory is perched on a natural slope of 11 degrees, which allows the telescope to track celestial sources for nearly ten hours in the east-west direction. As a result, the discoveries made here have been particularly useful in explaining various celestial phenomena.\\n\\n5. Udaipur Solar Observatory\\n\\nSituated on a tiny island at the centre of Fatehsagar Lake, Udaipur Solar Observatory was designed as per the model of solar observatory at the Big Bear Lake in Southern California.\\n\\nOne of the six GONG (Global Oscillations Network Group) sites in the world, this observatory is second in the world (after China) to have the unique multi-application solar telescope (MAST) for the detailed study of solar activities such as solar flares and eruptions.\\n\\nInterestingly, the observatory’s location is strategic, as well as scenic – the large water body surrounding the telescope decreases the amount of heating of the surface layers, reducing the turbulence in the air mass and thereby improving the image quality.\\n\\n6. ARIES Observatory, Nainital\\n\\nIn 2016, in a major technological advancement for astronomy in India, Asia’s largest and first-of-its-kind optical telescope was unveiled at Devasthal near Nainital. Called the Aryabhatta Research Institute for Observational Sciences (Aries) telescope, it is a joint effort by Indian, Belgian and Russian scientists.\\n\\nThe optical telescope’s primary mirror is 3.6 m in diameter, helping in further research of star structures, high energy radiations, exoplanets and properties of star clusters. A project that has been long in the making, the results of this outstanding telescope is eagerly awaited by Indian scientists.\\n\\n7. Mount Abu InfraRed Observatory (MIRO)\\n\\nPerched on the 5,000-foot-high craggy peak of Mt Gurushikhar (the highest peak in the Aravalli range), Mount Abu InfraRed Observatory is the first major facility in India to be specifically designed for ground-based infrared observations of celestial objects.\\n\\nDespite the rather modest astronomical facilities at this observatory, the data obtained from the observations made from the MIRO have resulted in more than 200 peer reviewed research publications. MIRO is in the process of acquiring a larger, 2.5m telescope that will give a boost to the observatory’s research programmes in atmospheric and space science.\\n\\nAlso Read: #TravelTales: We’ve Found the Best Places to Stargaze in India.

       " 'Second, DST had been founded in 2005, just three years before the 2008 world financial crisis laid waste to many Russian fortunes. Yet by 2009, Milner and Finger were going on a shopping spree that included some $500 million to buy 5 percent of Facebook as well as a chunk of the American online gaming company Zynga. Where did they get all of that money? Milner and Finger had started DST with their own funds, and the returns on their early investments, though very successful, were just a fraction of those sums, pocket change compared with the money they were throwing around by 2010. (At the time, a banker close to DST, who wished to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak on the record, told me that the returns on DST’s other investments “haven’t been sufficient to cover the Facebook and Zynga deals.”)\\n\\nThe funds, it turned out, came largely from Alisher Usmanov, an Uzbek-born billionaire who made his fortune in the mines of Central Asia. Usmanov, who owns a stake in the English football club Arsenal, was then-president Dmitri Medvedev’s patron; Usmanov had advised Medvedev when he served as head of Gazprom, and had been one of the first oligarchs to support Medvedev’s succession. A recent exposé by the opposition leader, Alexey Navalny, said that Usmanov bought luxury villas for Medvedev. (Usmanov sued Navalny for defamation in a Moscow court, and won.) Usmanov also had a fearsome reputation. He was known alternatively as “the hard man of Russia” and a “devourer of websites.” His biography includes a jail sentence from the 1980s for fraud and embezzlement, though a Soviet court later overturned the conviction, as well as a lawsuit in the United States, later dismissed, in which DeBeers claimed that Usmanov was part of a scheme that cheated it of $800 million in profits.\\n\\nMore importantly for the Kremlin, however, Usmanov had a long track record of buying properties—including paintings, publishing houses, and gas fields—on behalf of Kremlin interests. This time, Usmanov bought a 35-percent stake in DST, and was, by all accounts, Milner’s cash cow. “Usmanov’s stake is completely passive,” the banker told me in 2010. “He provides all the cash.”\\n\\nDST made some legitimately lucrative investments for Usmanov. He reportedly made $1 billion on the $200 million he invested in Facebook. The Russian companies that DST invested his money in also did quite well, but that was only half the point. The other half was to give the Kremlin a way to control these new and very influential companies, to make sure there was a receptive person there when the Kremlin called with a demand.\\n\\n“What is DST? DST is the main government internet company,” said one Russian tech executive, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of government reprisals, when I put this question to him in 2010. He was not the only one. In the tech community, another Russian executive told me at the time, “Usmanov”—and, by extension, DST—“is interpreted as a person who, on the Kremlin’s instructions, buys up various Russian [internet] properties.” Interviews with other prominent players in the booming Russian tech sector—local executives as well as Western investors—revealed that this was the near-unanimous understanding of DST’s role in the Russian tech marketplace; people’s equally unanimous reluctance to go on the record showed the sincerity of their belief. According to these insiders, DST’s links to the Kremlin, though close, were less than transparent. “It’s just not clear who, exactly, they represent and so not everybody wants to have them as an investor,” said one American investor I interviewed in 2010.',\n",
       " \"IN LAWN tennis and European Union budget fights alike, the British are fond of a heroic struggle that ends in defeat.\\n\\nNo sign of tennis on day three of David Cameron's tour of the Arab world, which has now reached the theme-park-like glitz of Doha, but British officials are briefing up a storm about a looming scrap with France and other “Club Med” EU members in Brussels. The battle is over the billions of euros in EU aid sent to north Africa and parts of the Middle East over the years, without a great deal to show for it by way of political reform. With the brushfires of revolt still burning across the region, Britain thinks it is high time for a serious debate about what, exactly, all this money is for.\\n\\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\\n\\nThe EU is good at imposing regulations on exports from the Muslim south, and hot as mustard on setting up such worthy, Euro-friendly bodies as a consumer protection agency in Egypt. Try selling milk or car parts from north Africa in Europe, and EU-funded inspectors will be all over you. Yet despite pouring millions into the regime of Hosni Mubarak, the EU never seemed to gain the leverage to stop his secret police torturing people.\\n\\nIn the words of one British official travelling with Mr Cameron: “There are very few solid examples of progress. We have continued to pour money into Egypt and other countries in the region, with very little conditionality applied.”\\n\\nThe British are right. Under the European Neighbourhood Policy, the EU is a huge donor in the region, indeed Europe is by some way the biggest source of aid to the Palestinian Authority. And yet Europe has gained pathetically little leverage with all this money.\\n\\nMr Cameron raised the lack of political and democratic strings attached to EU aid money at a recent European Council in Brussels, we learn. British diplomats have been primed to press home their point at a meeting to discuss the neighbourhood policy today,\\n\\nYet here is the thing. The British are going to struggle to win this argument, and I suspect they know it. The EU's neighbourhood policy has always divided the club. There is a Club Med group, involving France, Spain, Italy and the like, who have a strong and understandable interest pumping European money into countries that are (a) former colonies, (b) ancestral homelands for lots of their citizens and (c) a potential source of waves of illegal migration. There is a Nordic/ex-communist group which would like to see neighbourhood money heading to countries in the ex-Soviet sphere, from Ukraine to Moldova.\\n\\nThat leaves Britain looking, as so often, to the same handful of fellow budget-hawks for support, such as Germany and the Netherlands. Germany may be on side with this one, but long experience has taught the British not to put too much faith in such support: the Germans have a habit of sliding over to the French camp in the end.\\n\\nSo why fight? Well, from time to time, a fight on principle does a bit of good. What is the point of Europe bragging about its soft power, if it is all soft and no power?\\n\\nAgreeing the EU's next multi-annual budget is going to be a huge slog, and Britain wants to put down a few markers about the good use of taxpayers' money.\\n\\nTo be a bit more cynical, in the world of British Euro-politics, a heroic defeat plays well back with voters home. Just ask Tim Henman about his fan-base.\\n\\nTo be still more cynical, the British have less to lose than the Club Med countries with their push for tough conditions on EU aid for despots in the south, for two big reasons.\\n\\nFirstly, when it comes to trade with the Maghreb, say, Britain has much less at stake than France or Spain. And, to be fair, France is not only concerned about its commercial interests. I remember a big squabble over imports of cheap clothing from China, when I was based in Brussels. France was keen to see tariffs slapped on things like cotton shirts from China, and it would have been easy to assume that protectionism was at work. Except, I was told by French industry sources, the real concern in Paris was actually political: lots of cheap shirts on sale in France were made by young, male factory workers in north Africa, they said. The then president, Jacques Chirac, was worried that Chinese competition would destroy those factories, sending angry young men onto the streets of the Maghreb.\\n\\nSecondly, Britain does lots of trade with non-democracies and autocratic states in the Arab world, but—handily enough—they mostly do not need EU aid because they are rich petro-states. So a clamp down on EU aid will not touch them.\\n\\nIf you think I am too cynical, I would merely mention the case of the Palestinian Authority. For better or for worse, a push to link aid to political reforms, human rights or good governance by the PA could prove deeply destabilising, in a corner of the world that does not need less stability. And funnily enough, when asked about the PA and European aid, British sources are not quite so gung-ho about imposing political conditions. Our enthusiasm for conditionality is conditional, in short.\\n\\nMore from Qatar in a bit.\\n\\nThis post is the third in a series chronicling the Prime Minister's trip to the Middle East.

       " 'An arm of the Justice Department said Friday it would roll back Obama-era efforts to investigate local police departments and issue public reports about their failings — another way in which the Trump administration is trying to adopt a tough pro-police stance.\\n\\nThe changes were announced by the department\\'s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, which is halting a years-long effort begun in the previous administration to investigate and publicize the shortcomings of police departments.\\n\\nWithin the Justice Department, the civil rights division has for decades conducted \"pattern or practice\\'\\' probes of troubled police departments to determine whether there are systemic problems that require a court-appointed monitor to correct. In recent years, however, the COPS office had gradually expanded to do something similar, issuing public reports about problems it found in individual departments.\\n\\nOn Friday, the Justice Department signaled that it will leave such work to the civil rights division and that the COPS office would return to its roots — advising police departments on best practices, offering training and becoming more collaborative.\\n\\n[Sessions orders Justice Department to review all police reform agreements]\\n\\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions called the move \"a course correction to ensure that resources go to agencies that require assistance rather than expensive wide-ranging investigative assessments that go beyond the scope of technical assistance and support.\"\\n\\nSessions has said he aims to put the Justice Department on a more pro-police footing. Last month, he reversed an Obama administration move to restrict shipments of military surplus gear to police departments, saying in a speech that \"the previous administration was more concerned about the image of law enforcement being too \\'militarized\\' than they were about our safety.\"\\n\\nThe attorney general has also argued against actions that hurt police officers\\' morale. \"We cannot let the politicians, as they sometimes do, run down police and communities that are suffering, only to see crime spike in those communities,\" he said this summer.\\n\\nVanita Gupta, the former head of the Justice Department\\'s civil rights division who now works as president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said the decision is \"another indication of the full retreat from police reform by Jeff Sessions.\\'\\'\\n\\nThe collaborative effort, Gupta said, \"had buy-in from a lot of police chiefs\\'\\' because it was a less intrusive process than a pattern or practice probe.\\n\\nProponents of the Obama administration\\'s approach had argued that some departments have problems that can be fixed without the intervention of court orders and that the COPS office played a valuable role in finding such problems and recommending solutions.\\n\\nUnder the new model, the COPS office would not conduct the kind of investigation or issue the kind of report it did last year in San Francisco after angry protests of fatal shootings by officers.\\n\\nThe decision affects about 14 police departments nationwide that had either begun receiving public reports from the COPS office or expected to receive such reports soon.',\n",
       " 'Racial and educational splits are changing the old map rapidly.\\n\\nThere are two emerging post-election story lines about partisan battlegrounds that will mess up the neat red-state/blue-state maps political junkies carry around in their heads. The ultimate dimensions of the presidential contest will determine which one we are all gabbing about on November 9 — assuming we aren’t instead freaking out over hacked returns or civil unrest.\\n\\nIf Hillary Clinton builds on her current advantage and blows out to something approaching a double-digit lead in the national popular vote, she will likely win all the battleground states (loosely defined as including Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania). The big news might be that she could also carry Arizona and Georgia, which would be a sign that certain pro-Democratic demographic trends are arriving a bit earlier than expected. In this scenario, Texas could be close as well. An outcome like that would be a boon not only to Democrats, but to those Republicans who argue that any Trump-style white nationalist appeal is demographically doomed, even if a champion for it can be found who does not fatally alienate college-educated white women.\\n\\nIf, on the other hand, the presidential race stays reasonably competitive going down the stretch, it is looking more and more like Trump’s appeal to non-college-educated white voters and the angst he creates among minority and/or college-educated voters will reshape the traditional map. David Wasserman describes the change succinctly:\\n\\nIn 1996, Bill Clinton carried Iowa, Missouri and Ohio on his way to re-election, while losing Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia. Twenty years later, Hillary Clinton’s path to 270 electoral votes is more likely to do the opposite.\\n\\nIt’s not that complicated, really. The percentage of the electorate represented by non-college-educated white voters is 62 percent in Iowa and 53 percent in Ohio and Missouri (it’s also 57 percent in Wisconsin, which could win up being closer than we expect). It’s 42 percent in Colorado, 40 percent in North Carolina, and 37 percent in Virginia (it’s also 34 percent in Georgia, which is why that state is vulnerable to a big Democratic margin nationally). The more the balance of the electorate is composed of minorities rather than college-educated whites, the stronger the resistance to Trump seems to be.\\n\\nWe also are beginning, as Politico reports today, to see early voting trends that reinforce this new map:\\n\\nIn two must-win states for Trump, North Carolina and Florida, Republicans are clinging to narrow leads in the total number of mail-in ballots requested. Yet in both states, Clinton is ahead of President Barack Obama’s pace four years earlier — and the GOP trails Mitt Romney’s clip.\\n\\n\\n\\nAny diminishment of the GOP’s mail-in ballot lead is a matter of concern for Republicans because Democrats typically dominate early in-person voting in both states, which will begin over the next 10 days.\\n\\nVirginia does not really have early voting, and Colorado’s virtually all-mail-ballot system is not easy to assess at this stage. But North Carolina and Florida are behaving about as you might expect in the case of a small national lead for Clinton. So, too, are Iowa and Ohio:\\n\\n[T]here are undercurrents that should cause concern for the Democratic nominee. The party’s early-vote performance in Midwestern states like Iowa and Ohio appears to be well behind its 2012 pace. And it could be a signal that, while Democrats may be gaining strength up and down the East Coast, they could be losing steam in states Obama won twice, like Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin.\\n\\nIf that’s the way it ultimately shakes out, pro-Trump Republicans will have a better case to make that Trump had a path to victory via states Obama won twice, but was stabbed in the back by perfidious Establishment Republicans and knifed straight-on by the biased globalist media.\\n\\nA more worrisome possibility is that if Clinton beats Trump in a particularly strong performance among minority voters in states like Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, we’ll hear more than the usual amount of odious BS about “voter fraud.” In that contingency, we can only hope such arguments are made peacefully after Trump has conceded to Clinton.',\n",

This is perhaps the most commonly used transphobic trope in media : the deceptive trans woman, tricking hapless heterosexual men into having sex with them. It's a lazy, regressive device on its own; but with's developer Atlus, it comes with a storied history of degrading their trans and queer characters.\\n\\nCatherine: Full Body 's hard swerve into transphobia should come as no surprise to anyone who's played the original Catherine or the Persona games from the same team. Persona 2: Innocent Sin has a character respond to a trans male's appearance by saying “She looks cute.” Persona 3 's infamous beach scene featured a trans female predator who's outed by a bit of facial stubble she missed while shaving. Persona 5 , while not outwardly transphobic, still features numerous instances of gay panic. As a queer fan of the series—one who even has Persona 5 as their #2 game of the year—it often feels like Atlus hates its queer audience.\\n\\nIt's frustrating because they've made earnest attempts to honestly portray queer and trans identity, providing rare crumbs of visibility in a medium that makes us invisible. But visibility only damages when it's mired in harmful ideas, and never is that more apparent than with Persona 4 's Naoto Shirogane.\\n\\nNaoto as he appears in Persona 4: Arena.\\n\\nNaoto is an assigned-female-at-birth detective who presents as male in their daily life, his struggle to come to terms with his gender identity a rare instance of empathy in a series that's needlessly cruel to LGBT people. But Atlus demolishes that initial good will over the course of the game. Naoto's dungeon, which represents his psyche, has him threatening to perform a “dangerous experiment” on himself that's later revealed to be some form of gender reassignment surgery. Your goal as the player character is to stop him from making that decision, ultimately framing Naoto as a woman fed up with the demeaning treatment from their male peers. This, despite a later hot springs scene where Naoto's visibly uncomfortable with his naked body paired alongside his cis female companions, and other clear signs of gender dysphoria.\\n\\nThe most damning insult to his identity comes when you decide to initiate the romance route with him. During an intimate moment between you and Naoto where he expresses his wish to have been born a boy, you are able to initiate romance with him by responding, “I’m glad you’re a girl.” Later, after confessing your love, you’re able to ask him to change his talk in a higher pitch to sound more feminine. If you do so, Naoto comes to school in a girl’s uniform during the Christmas event.

This conflicting tug of empathy and delegitimization can be found in the real world, where the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published an open letter calling for compassion toward trans people while condemning parents who acknowledge their children's trans identities. Naoto Shirogane is Atlus' trans child, his legitimate desires and struggles written-off and dismissed in a way that his cis-hetero companions aren't, and that contradictory ethos carries over to\\n\\nCatherine centers around a strain of mysterious nightmares that only affect men and end in death, which plague our hero, Vincent, after he cheats on his girlfriend Katherine with a girl named... Catherine. Over the course of the game you drink with friends, complain about your problems, solve puzzles, and converse with other men who are suffering through the same nightmares. At one point, one of your childhood friends, a waitress named Erica, tells you she's experiencing these nightmares. But don't they only affect men? You see where this is going.\\n\\nIt is foreshadowed throughout that Erica is transgender, and though she's presented as a content, sexually confident woman, the game continually demeans her simply for being trans. When one of Vincent's friends, Toby, starts dating her, everyone in your friend circle snickers, unable to tell him the “truth.” Toby describes the sex with her as “weird,” the game othering her body relative to cis bodies.\\n\\nBy the end of the game, when Toby's disgusted at the reveal of her trans status, his friends laugh at him like they'd successfully executed the punchline to a long-running joke. Toby's attraction to a trans woman is embarrassing, emasculating, “gay.” On top of all this, Erica sees the same nightmares Vincent's getting because she's really just a “man” like the rest of 'em.\\n\\nWhy aren’t we letting trans creators tell these stories?\\n\\nThe transphobic lens through which Catherine views Erica is hardly new or surprising within the context of Atlus' other games. But it's not like the game’s depiction of cis people offers any nuance by comparison. Catherine purports to be a game explicitly about gender differences, trying to honestly examine the sexual power dynamics between (cis) men and women. But it only plays in Types. All men are cheating scumbags, Katherine is the “nagging shrew,” and Catherine is a femme fatale who's later revealed to be a literal succubus who “tricks” men into cheating on their partners. Erica being a classic “deceptive trans woman” isn't just the continuation of a trend, but a product of Catherine 's thesis of gender essentialism.\\n\\n“Gender essentialism” is the theory that our gender differences are innate, universal, and—according to transphobes—biological. Atlus' games are rife in essentialism. Erica will always be a man according to Atlus, so she is still treated as such. Naoto's desire for gender reassignment is deemed irrational and potentially damaging because, really, he'll always be a woman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the game's end, the nightmares are revealed to be divine punishment on men who stall procreation, shepherding women to men who can better serve the population growth. Men like Vincent, then, are expected to fall for the trap of Catherine without fail. In this way, 'Catherine' frames the struggle against these forces as a rebuke to socially assigned gender roles, with Vincent standing up for men everywhere who are pressured to treat women a certain way... except that never changes his actions throughout the rest of the game. Rather than harshly judge Vincent's shitty behavior, 'Catherine' instead absolves him. His very real cheating is spun as a divine trick that isn't really his fault, but that of the cruel god that sought to punish an “innocent man” for no good reason.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead of allowing a deeper understanding of either gender, Catherine lets its straight, cis male hero get away with fucking another woman without his nagging girlfriend finding out. The status quo remains largely unchanged, and everyone still laughs at Toby for sleeping with Erica. Essentialism in Catherine isn't just the driving force of its transphobia; it's also a system of belief that excuses male behavior. After all, how could Vincent resist Catherine's charms? Men will be men, and it's her fault for exploiting that fact.\\n\\nNow, with Catherine: Full Body 's Rin, that gender essentialism continues unabated, bringing the original's trans panic in an uncomfortable spotlight.\\n\\nAbove: The Japanese trailer for Catherine: Full Body .\\n\\nEven with the little we've seen of her, Rin is nearly every “deceptive trans woman” cliché rolled in one. Hyperfeminine, gender-neutral name, horror-movie cinematography as soon as her skirt's off. The damn logo of the game is formed from the silhouette of a leering shot of her panties, begging the audience to discern for themselves, “C'mon. Guess what's under there.” She's less a character designed by artists so much as by iconography; the iconography of The Crying Game , Dressed To Kill , Ace Ventura: Pet Detective , and Jerry Springer .\\n\\nAnd yet, certain subsections of the internet are defending Rin from a perceived “SJW” backlash. Some of these defenses are typical, such as the GamerGate pet-cause of “censorship.” Others are adopting the wait-and-see approach, arguing that the game can potentially be an honest exploration of gender identity, as if Atlus' track record and marketing weren't huge red flags.\\n\\nOne common defense I’ve seen on Twitter is the notion that Rin isn’t actually trans, despite being shot in trans-coded visual language, having a One common defense I’ve seen on Twitter is the notion that Rin isn’t actually trans, despite being shot in trans-coded visual language, having a webpage with a site icon that evokes the internationally used transgender symbol, and adorning herself in the colors of the transgender flag . Instead, these arguments use a very different yet intrinsically linked term to describe Rin:\\n\\nA “trap.”\\n\\nBut what is a trap, and why do gender essentialists gravitate towards it? While the term is often reappropriated by folks in the trans community, it retains its harmful connotation in the hands of cis people. Many in the anime and anime games community often use “trap” to describe characters who don't identify as female but present as such anyway, “trapping” the usually heterosexual, cisgender male hero into being attracted to them (a recent example is Felix in the anime Re:Zero ). This time it's “correct” to call them male because a trap knows they're “actually” male. It's the gender essentialist's platonic ideal of the “deceptive trans” trope. It's saying the quiet part loud.\\n\\nAnd it's existed beyond Japanese media, long before western anime fans made it part of their lexicon, as a persistent part of the transgender experience—a part that threatens our lives on a daily basis.\\n\\nHere are the facts:\\n\\nIn July of 2017, Dee Whigham was murdered by a former US Navy sailor, In July of 2017, Dee Whigham was murdered by a former US Navy sailor, who stabbed her 119 times when she disclosed her trans status after they had sex. “I lost it, I lost it,” he told the police, claiming he didn't remember much afterwards. He stabbed her in the face multiple times before slashing her throat, according to reports.\\n\\nIn 2002, Gwen Araujo was In 2002, Gwen Araujo was brutally beaten to death and strangled by a group of men in Newark, California after two of them, who had sex with her, later discovered she was transgender.

In my mind, I'm gay now.”\\n\\nIn other words, they'd trap him.\\n\\nKnowing what we know about Atlus’ history with trans people and the real world effects of its essentialist worldview, we can’t in good faith expect Rin to be an empathetic portrait of a transgender woman. So instead, let’s ask a more important question: Why aren’t we letting trans creators tell these stories?\\n\\nOur increased visibility can only do harm when we place our stories in the hands of cis developers. If gaming really wants to show our lives, simply offering us a seat at the table wouldn’t be an insurmountable step. We have lots of weird, funny, horrifying, incredible experiences to share, and gaming would make a fantastic avenue for sharing them. Propping up trans creators and collaborators can only evolve the medium’s potential to create radical new experiences. We should be pushing for that kind of progress before we give games like Catherine: Full Body the time of day.\",\n",

       " 'Next week, the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens will host special screenings of Blade Runner, Ridley Scott\\'s 1982 film about an apocalyptic future in which special police forces hunt down escaped human androids known as \"replicants,\" featuring a Q&A with its original screenwriter, Hampton Fancher, and Fancher\\'s 1999 film starring Owen Wilson as a serial killer, The Minus Man.\\n\\nThe subject of a new documentary about his decades-long career, Escapes, Fancher spoke with me this week about making movies, drugs and the wonder that Blade Runner isn\\'t as terrible as he thought it would be.\\n\\nIn the 34 years since it was released, Blade Runner has developed cult status, in part because it – like a lot of dystopian films of the 1970s and \\'80s – had a certain prescience. What do you think about when you look back on the film? I’m pleased in some invisible way within myself that something connected with people, in the prophetic aspect of it. But that seems very normal, very natural, to me, that we connect things in our minds. Not that I’m blasé. I’m glad that I was involved in something that’s proved to be so pertinent.\\n\\nWhat originally inspired you to adapt Philip K. Dick’s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? into a feature film? Aside from the detective narrative, which enticed me to think it could be a film, the significance had to do with ecology, from the eco-movement of the 1960s. And it came out of our experiments with LSD. We got really close to the trees, the grass, the bugs – we saw the world through acid. I started to think, \"Oh, shit – this is the end of nature.\" I wanted to blow the whistle a bit. I mean, I wasn’t seriously blowing the whistle – I’m just a pipsqueak, everyone’s a pipsqueak – but I wanted to do something.\\n\\nWhat kind of headspace were you in at the time? There was a doomful feeling, that we were killing the environment, that the birds won’t be chirping. But it’s an odd sort of dichotomy, because there was joy in the process too. [Hieronymus] Bosch must have had a good time painting hell. We wouldn’t want to be in it, but in a way, we get cozy when we’re in the midst of ugly predictions.\\n\\nHow do you think the film has aged? I don’t really know. I haven’t seen it for a while.\\n\\nYou recently wrote a sequel to Blade Runner, titled The Shape of the Final Dog, that’s in pre-pre-production now. Tell me about that. It’s a new character, a new detective. I was literally writing the last sentence of the story and the phone rang, and it was Ridley asking if I had any ideas for a Blade Runner sequel. I said, “You must be at the bottom of the barrel” to be calling me.\\n\\nWhen was that? That was about three years ago. Then, about a year ago, I went out and saw a lot of the graphics they were developing, and they blew my mind. I was glad with my script, but I still thought, “How do you beat the old Blade Runner?” I think this does it.\\n\\nBlade Runner has a campiness that contemporary science fiction films don’t have. Do you think that filmmakers today go overboard with CGI? I don’t know what you mean by “campiness,” but in filmmaking it’s always the same: If it’s contrivance and transparent, it’s shit, but if the world they create is compelling and convincing, then they’ve got you. It’s one of the liabilities of artifice, but in the end, it’s all about character.\\n\\nSay more about that. If something doesn’t have character, then it’s just style, nothing but flash. Authenticity is character, and character is physical. If it was hollow, banal, small talk trying to dress itself up, you’d walk away and shudder. But the new Blade Runner – and the cast, and the director – I knew they hadn’t made any mistakes. I think it’s going to be a very satisfying experience.\\n\\nLet’s talk about The Minus Man, which you wrote and directed and is screening next week at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens. Minus Man is a very special film for me. I’m afraid there will only be six people in the audience, but I’ll go because I want to see the ambience.\\n\\nWhat do you mean by that? I’ve learned through the years that every time you see a film it’s different – depending on the audience. The mood of the room spreads and infects everyone there – it’s like a virus. And I’ll be interested to see Minus Man, because it’s very personal to me. A critic came up to me at the San Francisco Film Festival and I worried that he was going to go on about Blade Runner – people do that all the time, tell me that Blade Runner is one of their favorite movies – but he said Minus Man and I hugged him.\\n\\nWhat makes Minus Man so special for you? The experience of making it was so satisfying that I just wanted to do it again. And it’s about what a lot of things are about, maybe the most important thing that anything could be about. It’s what the bible is about – I don’t know, I’ve never read the bible – but it’s about good and evil. That shimmers – spiritually, intellectually, emotionally – to me. And everybody worked so hard on it – they didn’t want to go home – and together we created a universe. It was like being a kid in the backyard with a bunch of other kids building a tree house.\\n\\nAnd that was different than making Blade Runner? Oh yeah, Blade Runner was such a bad experience that so many of the people involved never wanted to make another film.\\n\\nWhat made it such a bad experience? Rancor, lack of communication, you name it. I wasn’t involved for most of it – David Peoples took over the writing process and I just came back in the end to help with the rooftop scene – but a lot of people didn’t like each other.\\n\\nAnd yet, it turned out OK in the end. That shocked a lot of people. Because how could that be good? The poison involved in that film – the insecurities, the anger – it was a junkyard that turned into fertility. Everybody did their jobs superbly, but still there was torture involved – self-inflicted torture, but still, torture.\\n\\nDid you think that would affect the film? I thought the film was going to be terrible – especially the voiceover. But when I went to the premiere at the Academy, and saw that opening shot of the cityscape, you could just feel this tacit applause in the audience. When it was over, I went searching for Ridley so I could congratulate him for doing what couldn’t be done. I was thrilled.\\n\\nStill, Blade Runner was a commercial flop when it was released. Yeah, but I wasn’t even unhappy when it turned out to flop. Everyone struggled to make it, and there was fear that it would go belly-up. The working conditions were tough, and there wasn’t enough money to do all the things we wanted to do. And we shot it on this little back lot at Warner Bros, but goddamn, there’s a world there. That was some technical magic.\\n\\nAnd now it’s considered one of the greatest films of all time. I don’t think there’s another film in history that flopped and then came back and did the opposite of flop. I was surprised by how deep its legs are. Even now, when people talk about it – I just don’t get it. Why is it such an important film? I have thoughts about it, and talk to people about it, but nothing definitive. It\\'s like art itself. It’s the soul of the thing, the character.',\n",
       " 'An Alabama college student who joined ISIS in Syria wants to come home and take responsibility for her actions. The U.S. government says she was never a citizen—and can’t enter the country.\\n\\nHoda Muthana’s story is not unlike that of other children of immigrants. She was born in New Jersey and raised in Alabama, where she was studying for a business degree. Her father described her as religious, but worried that she might be surreptitiously talking to boys. That’s why few would have predicted that she would withdraw from the University of Alabama in 2014 and make her way to ISIS-controlled territory in Syria.\\n\\nNow, with ISIS confined to a tiny pocket of Syria, Muthana says that she wants to return to the United States with her 18-month-old son. In doing so, she has triggered a dispute that could have far-reaching implications for American citizens the world over.\\n\\nMuthana, who now lives in a displaced-persons camp in Syria, says she is prepared to face justice for her actions, which include sending tweets that exhorted Americans to commit acts of violence. The Trump administration argues, however, that not only is Muthana not an American citizen, but she was never eligible to be one, and so she cannot enter the United States. A lawsuit filed last week by Muthana’s father on her behalf at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenges that assertion, setting up a legal battle.',\n",
       " 'Eight national monuments created in California over the past two decades will be reviewed under an executive order signed Wednesday by President Trump that second-guesses designations covering more than a billion acres nationwide.\\n\\nThe monuments in California cover huge swaths of desert, mountains, lakes and forests, including rare stands of ancient sequoia trees. The question of whether Trump can repeal any of the designations is likely to end up in court if the president tries to do so.\\n\\nHis order instructs the Interior Department to review all national monuments designated by presidents since 1996 that are at least 100,000 acres, including 265 million acres protected by President Barack Obama.\\n\\nDuring a signing ceremony Wednesday, Trump called Obama’s monument designations a “land grab” and said the order is designed to “end another egregious abuse of federal power, and to give that power back to the states and to the people, where it belongs.”\\n\\nIt means 30 or so monuments nationwide could be subject to alterations in size, purpose or ways the land is used. The president ordered Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to evaluate each site designation for its compatibility with the original intent of federal law and its effect on the public’s use and access.\\n\\nUnder the order, Zinke will consider public and official opposition to national-monument designations and recommend any modifications within 120 days.\\n\\nEnvironmentalists and legislators who support the monuments reacted with outrage.\\n\\n“We’re treating this as the opening salvo of a full-scale attack on national monuments,” said Dan Hartinger, deputy director of parks and public lands for the Wilderness Society. “Removing the protections would be the first step you’d need to opening them back up to extractive uses like oil, timber and commercial fishing.”\\n\\nZinke promised to uphold the 1906 Antiquities Act, which gives the president power to create national monuments on public lands, but said he agrees with Trump that the law should not be be used to restrict historic uses like farming, grazing, ranching, timber harvesting, fishing or motorized recreation.\\n\\n“We feel that the public, the people affected, should be considered,” Zinke said.\\n\\nTwelve monuments have been established in California since 1996, but only eight of them fall under the order: Berryessa Snow Mountain, which sprawls across Napa, Solano, Yolo and four other counties in Northern California; Giant Sequoia, in the Sequoia National Forest in the southern Sierra; Cascade-Siskiyou, in southwestern Oregon and northwestern California; Carrizo Plain in the southern San Joaquin Valley; San Gabriel Mountains, northeast of Los Angeles; Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains, west of the Coachella Valley in Riverside County; and two desert monuments that were pushed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Sand to Snow and Mojave Trails.\\n\\n“For Californians who love the West, there is a lot to fear,” said David Myers, executive director of the Wildlands Conservancy. “These are places where we camp, hike, hunt, fish, so an attack on one is an attack on all. The administration is not standing with the American people — they are standing with a small minority of companies that want to privatize our public lands.”\\n\\nSeveral California legislators and conservationists were confident that at least some of the state’s monuments would pass muster, even under an administration that has made clear that commercial interests should play a larger role in the government’s environmental decision-making.\\n\\n“Berryessa Snow Mountain is a textbook-perfect example of what a monument designation should look like,” said Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, who persuaded Obama to designate a 100-mile swath of land stretching from the shores of Lake Berryessa to the flanks of Snow Mountain in 2015. “The business community in the area sent over 100 letters in support, and every board of supervisors passed resolutions.”\\n\\nHowever, California’s desert national monuments could be in jeopardy. Obama protected 1.8 million acres in February 2016 at the behest of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who championed the monument designations for years.\\n\\nHouse Republicans opened an investigation in March 2016 into the desert monuments, claiming a “lack of transparency and consultation with local stakeholders.”\\n\\nThe stakeholders they were referring to included local miners, rock collectors, recreational-vehicle users and others who feared their use of the land would be curtailed. The California Off-Road Vehicle Association was initially concerned, but eventually acquiesced under Feinstein’s prodding.\\n\\n“The federal agencies have been very engaged and very responsive to our concerns,” said Amy Granat, managing director of the Off-Road Vehicle Association, which is working with officials on management plans at the desert monuments and Berryessa Snow Mountain that would permit off-road vehicles.\\n\\nBack to Gallery National monuments under siege by Trump include 8 in... 7 1 of 7 Photo: ROBYN BECK, AFP/Getty Images 2 of 7 Photo: David Lamfrom / National Parks Conservation Association 3 of 7 Photo: STEPHEN CROWLEY, NYT 4 of 7 Photo: LARRY DOWNING, REUTERS 5 of 7 Photo: Andy Murdock, Special to The Chronicle 6 of 7 Photo: Reed Saxon, Associated Press 7 of 7 Photo: Francisco Kjolseth, Associated Press\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDavid Lamfrom, California desert director for the National Parks Conservation Association, defended the desert monuments as crucial wildlife corridors that also preserve the last open stretch of historic Route 66.\\n\\n“The California desert monuments were the product of legislation and a really widespread, grassroots-focused community process,” Lamfrom said. “When the Trump administration reviews the California desert national monuments, they will find a community that strongly backs them and a business community that cares deeply about protecting them.”\\n\\nThe administration and Republican legislators are apparently determined to test their resolve.\\n\\nThe Antiquities Act “does not give the federal government unlimited power to lock up millions of acres of land and water, and it’s time we ended this abusive practice,” Trump said.\\n\\nThe act has been used by 16 presidents, half of them Republican, to protect natural and historic features, including Muir Woods National Monument. President Herbert Hoover used it to establish Death Valley as a national monument in 1933, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt designated Joshua Tree in 1936. Both later became national parks.\\n\\nObama was particularly gung-ho about the act, using it to protect more than 550 million acres in 34 national monuments, more than Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton put together.\\n\\nTrump’s review was prompted in part by Utah GOP Sens. Orrin Hatch and Rob Bishop, who strongly objected to Obama’s 2016 designation of the 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears National Monument in southeastern Utah.\\n\\nThe monument, named after a pair of buttes that rise above the Colorado Plateau, is the ancestral home of several American Indian tribes and features 100,000 archaeological sites, including ancestral Puebloan cliff dwellings. The two senators said far more land than necessary was set aside in the monument.\\n\\nUtah’s congressional delegation was also highly critical of Clinton’s 1996 designation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in their state, which explains why Trump’s order goes back 21 years.\\n\\nNo president has ever rescinded a national monument designation, and there is no provision in the Antiquities Act for reversal. Legal experts say shrinking or revoking a monument would have to be done through an act of Congress, but some Republicans believe Trump can do it unilaterally and should be willing to go to court if necessary to win that right.\\n\\nConservationists reject that notion, saying Trump’s order is not only unnecessary but harmful.\\n\\n“What they are doing is undermining one of the United States’ most important conservation laws and politicizing national monuments in a way that they frankly don’t deserve,” said Ani Kame’enui, director of legislation and policy for the National Parks Conservation Association. “Public lands are owned by all Americans. By calling into question these sites, they are calling into question part of the American story that is manifested in these sites.”\\n\\nPeter Fimrite is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

       " 'WARNING: Spoilers ahead for “Game of Thrones” Season 7.\\n\\nOne bit of Valyrian steel keeps cropping up around “Game of Thrones” this season: the dagger used in the attempt on Bran’s (Isaac Hempstead Wright) life in Season 1.\\n\\nLet’s quickly recap: After being pushed out of a window, the young Stark was attacked in his recovery bed by a hired assassin who ends up getting mauled by Bran’s direwolf, Summer (RIP). His mother, Catelyn (Michelle Fairley), then takes the distinctive blade to her husband at King’s Landing, where Littlefinger (Aiden Gillen) claims it originally belonged to him but that he lost it in a bet with Tyrion (Peter Dinklage). Thing is, honesty is the last quality Littlefinger is known for.\\n\\nWith a black tapered handle and blood-red stone topping off a curved blade, the dagger ― sometimes called “catspaw” for its association with the assassin ― is a fairly wicked-looking instrument.\\n\\nAnd the foreshadowing is strong with this one: HBO Nordic featured the weapon in a cheeky teaser for Season 7 alongside the words “be prepared” on its Facebook page. It was also featured prominently on Arya’s (Maisie Williams) hip in Season 7 promotional images for Entertainment Weekly, suggesting it’ll end up in her care.\\n\\nEntertainment Weekly\\n\\nBut last we know, the dagger was still in the possession of Littlefinger. And in the Episode 4 trailer, we see what appear to be his hands unsheathing the blade. (Catch the full trailer above.)\\n\\nAlthough the shot is dark, the rings appear to be the ones Littlefinger is shown wearing earlier in the series. The sleeve styling appears similar to that favored by Littlefinger, too.\\n\\nHBO A shot from Episode 4, above, looks a lot like Littlefinger, below.\\n\\nIf the blade changes hands, some fans wonder whether that might spell the end for Littlefinger, whose betrayal of Ned Stark (Sean Bean) in Season 1 isn’t widely known at the moment.\\n\\nThere are a few good reasons to believe his time is now running out. Even though his knights saved the day during the Battle of the Bastards, Sansa (Sophie Turner) clearly doesn’t have much love for Littlefinger after the whole Ramsay thing. Bran has also returned to Winterfell with his newfound ability to see into the past and present, worldwide, making it pretty clear that he’s been doing some off-camera exploring. If he discovers Littlefinger’s past scheming, he could pass on that knowledge to his assassin sister Arya, who may make her return in Episode 4. (It sure looks like Arya is looking out onto Winterfell from horseback at the end of the teaser.)\\n\\nAnother detail in the show suggests the dagger will do some damage: It shows up in a book Sam was reading at the Citadel in the Season 7 premiere. As Samwell Tarly actor John Bradley told HuffPost earlier this month, viewers are meant to notice it ― he was told to linger on that page during the shoot.\\n\\nAside from its obvious power to enact vengeance, the dagger might also prove useful in the war to come. Valyrian steel is one of few things that can kill White Walkers, which we observed when Jon (Kit Harington) killed a Walker with his Valyrian sword, Longclaw. (Dragonglass also gets the job done.)\\n\\nWe like the idea of Arya having some at her side, just like her big brother ― er, cousin. Aww.',\n",

Family and friends from surrounding villages told them of a convoy of cargo trucks, pickups and motorcycles.\\n\\nResidents said they passed along warnings to local authorities that night. Police called for reinforcements, but none came. Everyone, including police, fled into the bush. But the girls remained asleep in their dorms.\\n\\nCNN\\'s Nima Elbagir toured the school, gutted by militants as they fled, and spoke with one of the girls who managed to escape Boko Haram fighters that night.\\n\\nThe girl told Elbagir how she made a dash for freedom after militants loaded them into trucks and drove them into the nearby Sambisa Forest.\\n\\n\"We ran into the bush,\" she said of her escape with two others. \"We ran and we ran.\" Lost and terrified, she said, they later ran toward flames they presumed were rising from a building set ablaze by the militants in their hometown.\\n\\nThe escapees were lucky. The missing girls probably have been separated and taken out of the country by now, officials said.\\n\\n\"The search must be in Niger, Cameroon and Chad, to see if we can find information,\" said Gordon Brown, the former UK prime minister and a U.N. special envoy for global education.\\n\\nBut Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said he believes the girls are still in the forest where the militants disappeared shortly after their capture.\\n\\nWho\\'s the man in the video?\\n\\nGovernment officials disputed Monday that the man in the video with the girls is Shekau.\\n\\nSecurity forces have confirmed and are sure Shekau is dead, said Marilyn Ogar, deputy director of State Security Services in Nigeria. \"So whoever is speaking as Abubakar Shekau is not Abubakar Shekau.\"\\n\\nThe same man appears in Boko Haram videos claiming to be Shekau at least as far back as August. And at least one expert doubted Ogar\\'s claim.\\n\\nJacob Zenn, an expert on Boko Haram at the Jamestown Foundation , a policy center based in Washington, said he is skeptical of the Nigerian claim unless it can be backed up with hard evidence.\\n\\nHe said Nigerian authorities have said Shekau was dead several times, only for him to resurface and for the Nigerian military subsequently to acknowledge that he was alive.\\n\\n\"The two recent videos after the abduction of the girls look similar to most of the images, voice and mannerisms of Shekau in almost all Boko Haram videos, including videos when he was a local imam in northeastern Nigeria before 2010,\" Zenn said.\\n\\nIf the government\\'s assertion turns out to be untrue, it wouldn\\'t be the first time it has been wrong about the terror group since the girls\\' abductions. Early in their disappearance, government officials said many of the girls had been recovered -- news that, sadly, turned out to be incorrect.\\n\\nGlobal search effort\\n\\nWhile experts analyze the video, the international effort to find the girls is gaining steam.\\n\\nU.S. and British officials are in the capital of Abuja to help look for the girls, plan rescue missions and advise on ways to quash the terror group.\\n\\nThe United States is providing manned Defense Department aerial surveillance planes over Nigerian territory and sharing commercial satellite images with Nigeria as part of efforts to find the girls, two senior Obama administration officials told CNN\\'s Elise Labott on Monday.\\n\\nChina and France are also helping in the search. Israel plans to send a team of counterterrorism experts to help, Jonathan\\'s office said Sunday.\\n\\nThe United States has said it has no plans to send combat troops.\\n\\nThe U.S. team is working to help the Nigerian military plan operations and boost its capacity, providing investigation and intelligence support, advising on hostage negotiations and other issues, a senior State Department official told Labott.\\n\\nWhy did help arrive so late?\\n\\nThe United States offered assistance immediately after the mass abductions, but Nigeria turned it down until it became apparent that the situation needed a greater response, senior U.S. State Department officials told CNN.\\n\\nLast week Secretary of State John Kerry said that the United States has been engaged since Day One.\\n\\nAn explosive report Friday accused military commanders of knowing the terror group was headed to the school at least four hours in advance.

       " 'Senate Republicans are gambling that repealing Obamacare’s individual mandate will make the math work on their tax bill.\\n\\nBut the $340 billion in savings comes at a huge cost: 13 million fewer Americans are projected to have insurance in 2027, and premiums are expected to rise.\\n\\nThat could put the votes of Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) in jeopardy. Republicans can lose only two of their 52 members and still pass the tax legislation; Collins and Murkowski already voted against a bill that did little more than repeal the individual mandate over the summer.\\n\\nSo Senate leaders are making a counteroffer: They will simultaneously pass a bill to stabilize the Obamacare marketplaces, negotiated by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Patty Murray (D-WA). The pitch is that this will help offset the consequences of repealing the mandate. The markets will be strengthened. Worried senators can thus support a tax bill with the mandate’s repeal.\\n\\nMurkowski signaled this move might work for her.\\n\\n“If the Congress is going to move forward with repeal of the individual mandate, we absolutely must have the Alexander-Murray piece that is passed into law,” she told Roll Call late last week, though she softened her stance slightly in a later statement.\\n\\nCollins also sounded open to the possibility, though she wants an additional infusion of federal dollars to shore up the insurance markets.\\n\\nBut health policy experts say Alexander-Murray isn’t nearly enough to offset the consequences of repealing the mandate. The individual mandate, as unpopular as it is, is one of the pillars of the health care law. The stabilization bill does little more than guarantee payments to health insurers that were only in doubt because President Trump cut them off.\\n\\nThe truth is repealing the mandate but boosting Obamacare with Alexander-Murray would still leave the markets worse off — maybe even worse than if they had simply repealed the mandate on its own.\\n\\n“Why would you make things worse when you just decided to make things better? That’s a logical question,” said Robert Laszewski, a consultant who works with the health insurance industry. “Nothing the Republicans have done about the insurance exchanges has made any sense since Inauguration Day!”\\n\\nWhy Alexander-Murray won’t fix the individual mandate’s repeal\\n\\nThe Senate tax plan would repeal the individual mandate, which requires every American to have insurance or pay a penalty, without replacing it. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it would lead to 13 million fewer Americans having health coverage in 2027 and premiums increasing by an additional 10 percent in most years, compared to current law.\\n\\nSo the mandate’s repeal leads to a smaller, more expensive insurance market. The mandate is designed, after all, to bring healthier people into the market — without it, we would expect the remaining customers to be sicker and therefore cost more.\\n\\nAlexander-Murray doesn’t really take any steps to address those problems. The stabilization bill is actually dealing with a whole different set of issues, brought on by Trump’s overt sabotage of the health care law.\\n\\nThat legislation would guarantee federal payments to health insurers for what are called cost-sharing reductions, discounts that insurers are required to provide to their lowest-income customers, for the next two years. Trump has ended those payments for now, amid an ongoing Republican lawsuit challenging the payments’ legality without congressional approval. (The bill would also give states some new flexibility under an Obamacare waiver program.)\\n\\nThe uncertainty around the cost-sharing payments raised premiums for 2018 by an additional 20 percent or more. Alexander-Murray would help restore confidence that they would be paid and prevent further increases in future year, but that doesn’t really do anything to counter the effects of repealing the individual mandate.\\n\\nAlexander-Murray is best thought of as an attempt to mitigate the damage that Trump has already done to Obamacare’s insurance markets. But repealing the mandate in the tax plan would erode the markets even further, and this other bill doesn’t have any provisions designed to address that new harm.\\n\\n“The primary benefit of Alexander-Murray would be symbolic. It would be a sign that some bipartisan effort aimed at stabilizing the insurance market is possible, potentially boding well for future efforts,” Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “But, beyond the symbolism, it really wouldn’t do much to offset the effects of repealing the individual mandate, and could arguably even make things worse.”\\n\\nThat’s because most states and health insurers found a way to price their plans after the loss of cost-sharing reductions so that they actually yielded better deals for many Americans who buy insurance through Obamacare. If Alexander-Murray were passed, it would make those strategies unnecessary, eliminating these cheaper deals for people.\\n\\nThen when you add in the repeal of the mandate, and the resulting rise in premiums, you have a market that might be even worse off than if Republicans had simply repealed the mandate and not passed Alexander-Murray. (David Anderson at Balloon Juice broke down this counterintuitive possibility concisely here.)\\n\\nThe exact effects can be debated and might be simply unknowable. But what we can conclude, according to these experts, is that passing Alexander-Murray won’t be nearly enough to negate the consequences of repealing the mandate.\\n\\nRepublicans are asking Collins and Murkowski to ignore this problem\\n\\nNevertheless, for the time being, Senate leadership’s strategy will be to convince Murkowski and Collins, both of whom are uncomfortable with repealing the mandate because of its effects on the insurance markets, that passing Alexander-Murray would address their concerns.\\n\\n@SenJohnThune CONFIRMS:\\n\\n-Individual mandate repeal will be added to tax bill in SFC.\\n\\n-They have 50 votes on the floor.\\n\\n-Passing Alexander-Murray alongside (not within the tax bill) is part of the deal. — Mike DeBonis (@mikedebonis) November 14, 2017\\n\\nSenate Republicans are taking advantage of the superficial logic — repealing the mandate and Alexander-Murray both affect the insurance market, so it makes sense to tackle them at once — to paper over the fact that the tax bill and the stabilization bill are actually dealing with two totally different issues within the health care law.\\n\\n“Anybody who wants to sign up can,” Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH), who is deeply involved with the tax plan, told reporters last week about the mandate’s repeal. “All it says is you aren’t penalized if you don’t — and since the Supreme Court called it a tax, I think it’s appropriate to have it included in the tax bill.\\n\\n“By putting it in there, we have a better chance of moving forward with something along the lines of what Sen. Alexander is talking about,” he continued. “Those, I think, complement one another.”\\n\\nIt’s a high-stakes gamble for Senate leaders. Collins or Murkowski could prove to be the decisive vote on the tax overhaul.\\n\\nWith two votes to spare, leadership doesn’t have much wiggle room. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) has already said he’s opposed, though he has left the door open to backing the bill. Several others, including Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Bob Corker (R-TN), have signaled their concerns about the bill’s $1.5 trillion increase to the federal deficit.\\n\\nCollins is probably the toughest get — she has sounded bullish at times about tax reform, but she is easily the most moderate Republican member of the Senate. She has objected strongly to adding the mandate repeal to the tax bill, and she wants more insurance market aid than Alexander-Murray would provide: an infusion of federal reinsurance funding.\\n\\nAll of that makes Murkowski close to a must-have for Senate leaders, if Collins and one of Flake, Corker, or Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) ultimately oppose the bill.\\n\\nShe has said mixing health care with tax reform makes her uneasy.\\n\\n“Tax reform is complicated enough, and when you add health care reform in at the same time, it continues to complicate it,” Murkowski told reporters last week — which might help explain why she wants Alexander-Murray to be passed in tandem.\\n\\nIt probably doesn’t help that Senate Democrats have also warned they’ll vote against Alexander-Murray if it is being used to help advance a tax bill that they oppose.\\n\\nBut regardless, the stabilization bill won’t solve the problems that the Republican tax plan would create. Passing Alexander-Murray is simply a cover, one divorced from the policy reality created by repealing the individual mandate.\\n\\nSenate leaders are hoping that’s nevertheless enough for Murkowski and any other Republicans wavering about adding health care to the volatile tax debate.',\n",
       " 'If Syrian dictator Bashar Assad decides to use his chemical weapons, there won\\'t be a thing the U.S. military can do to stop him, America\\'s top military officer conceded on Thursday. Nor will the U.S. step into a \"hostile\" atmosphere, with or without Assad, to keep those chemicals under control.\\n\\nIt\\'s been a month since U.S. intelligence learned that Assad\\'s forces were mixing some of their precursor chemicals for sarin gas, as Danger Room first reported. The Syrian military even loaded aerial bombs with the deadly agent. Assad hasn\\'t used the weapons – yet. Should he change his mind, there\\'s little chance the U.S. would know it before it\\'s too late to stop the first chemical attack in the Mideast in over 20 years.\\n\\n\"The act of preventing the use of chemical weapons would be almost unachievable,\" Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon. \"You would have to have such clarity of intelligence, persistent surveillance, you\\'d have to actually see it before it happened. And that\\'s unlikely, to be sure.\"\\n\\nThat explains the emphasis the Obama administration has given, from President Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on down, to publicly warning Assad that using his chemical weapons would cross a \"red line.\" Dempsey said that \"messaging\" seeks to establish a deterrent, since Assad might think it would prompt outright U.S. or international intervention leading to his downfall. But that\\'s different from preemption.\\n\\nAmerican officials began strategizing months ago for how it should operate in a post-Assad Syria. And that includes scoping out plans for disposing of Assad’s stockpiles of nerve and mustard agents.\\n\\nToday, however, Panetta shot down a related preventive step: sending U.S. troops into the chaos of the Syrian civil war to secure the chemical stocks.\\n\\nU.S. military officials have previously speculated that an intervention to take hold of an estimated 500 tons of chemical precursors would require 75,000 troops, a force larger than the one currently in Afghanistan. Panetta said the international community needs to establish a \"process and procedure\" for keeping the stockpiles under control – but only after Assad falls, which is an uncertain proposition. U.S. intervention to lock down the chemicals, Panetta said, would depend on the establishment of new regime willing to invite the U.S. military in – another uncertain proposition.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not working on options that involve boots on the ground,\" Panetta said. If there\\'s a \"peaceful transition,\" then the U.S. might consider a request that a friendly successor government might make to secure the chemical stocks. \"But in a hostile situation, we\\'re not planning for that.\" It\\'s looking likely that the 400 U.S. soldiers sent to Turkey to man Patriot missile batteries could be the only uniformed troops that the Pentagon openly sends to handle the Syrian crisis.\\n\\nThe U.S. public has little appetite for throwing exhausted U.S. soldiers and marines into yet another bloody Mideastern conflict. But Panetta and Dempsey\\'s concession underscores the massive risks that the Syrian civil war poses for either the use or black market proliferation of chemical weapons. The revolution has already claimed the lives of 60,000 Syrians. The longer it goes on, the greater the pressure Assad may feel to unleash his unconventional arms. Alternatively, various Syrian factions might be either unwilling or unable to secure the stocks, should they prevail, nor is there any guarantee they will give up the chemical weapons once victorious.\\n\\nThere is confusion about how long the sarin gas will remain usable once its precursors combine. Nerve agents are inherently unstable, but U.S. government sources have told Danger Room that Syrian sophistication with chemical weaponry may leave the combined, weaponized sarin deadly for up to a year. Dempsey and Panetta, however, believe that they\\'ll break down after 60 days. \"That\\'s what the scientists tell us,\" Dempsey said. \"I\\'d still be reluctant to handle it myself.\"\\n\\nDisposing of (or \"demilitarizing\") chemical weapons is extraordinarily difficult under any circumstances; Iraq’s former chemical bunkers are still toxic nearly than a decade after Saddam’s overthrow, and the U.S. recently said it won’t be done disposing of its Cold War chemical weapon arsenal until 2023. Assad’s nerve agents will be no exception.\\n\\nOne of sarin\\'s main precursors – methylphosphonyl difluoride, or DF – can be turned into a somewhat non-toxic slurry, if combined properly with lye and water. The problem is that when DF reacts with water, it generates heat. And since DF has an extremely low boiling point — just 55.4 degrees Celsius — it means that the chances of accidentally releasing toxic gases are really high. \"You could easily kill yourself during the demil,\" one observer told Danger Room during the fall. That would explain Dempsey\\'s reluctance to touch it.\\n\\nNaturally, this process could only begin once the DF and the rubbing alcohol (sarin\\'s other main precursor) was gathered up from Assad’s couple dozen storage locations. Then, they’d have to be carted far, far out into the desert — to make sure no bystanders could be hurt — along with the enormous stirred-tank reactors needed to conduct the dangerous chemistry experiments. And when it was all done, there would the result would be a whole lot of hydrofluoric acid, which is itself a poison.\\n\\nIt\\'s an operation that will take many months, many men, and many millions of dollars. No wonder the leaders of America\\'s overtaxed military won\\'t commit to the job until the Syrian civil war is done.',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) -- The suicide bomber who killed seven CIA officials and a Jordanian military officer last week in Afghanistan was a Jordanian double-agent, a former U.S. intelligence official told CNN Monday.\\n\\nThe bomber was a source who came to the base camp in Khost near the Pakistan border for a meeting on December 30, a senior U.S. official also confirmed.\\n\\nThe man had been used by both countries\\' intelligence services in the past, and had provided information about high-value targets, the senior U.S. official said.\\n\\n\"Yes, it was a joint U.S.-Jordanian source who had provided over the period of his cooperation a lot of very detailed good information that was of high interest at the most senior levels of the U.S government,\" the former U.S. intelligence official said.\\n\\nThe security breach occurred because the bomber was met off-base by U.S. intelligence officials who failed to search him before they put him in a car and drove him onto Forward Operating Base Chapman, the former intelligence official said.\\n\\nBoth the Jordanian and U.S. intelligence services believed the man was loyal, according to the former intelligence official.\\n\\n\"Clearly there is a lot of soul searching\" at CIA headquarters in Virginia, according to the former intelligence official.\\n\\nThe bomber was identified as Human Khalil Abu-Mulal al Balawi, from the Jordanian town of Zarqa, also home to the late Abu Musab al Zarqawi, the one-time leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the former intelligence official said.\\n\\nBoth the Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed al Balawi had been rehabilitated from extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al Zawahiri, the second-ranking al Qaeda official to Osama bin Laden, the former intelligence official said.\\n\\nJordanian intelligence services have long covertly cooperated with the United States, specifically in the hunt for al Zawahiri and bin Laden, because of the ability of Jordanian agents to blend into the al Qaeda organization, noted the former intelligence official.\\n\\nAlso killed in last week\\'s attack in Afghanistan was Jordanian Army Captain Sharif Ali bin Zeid, a cousin of King Abdullah of Jordan. The Jordanian government has not publicly commented on the specific circumstances of bin Zeid\\'s death, but U.S. sources confirmed bin Zeid was present and was the Jordanian operative working closely with al Balawi.\\n\\nThe CIA refused to comment Monday, saying the matter was under investigation. The bodies of the seven CIA employees were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to a private ceremony attended by CIA Director Leon Panetta, other agency and national security officials, and friends and family.\\n\\nA Jordanian official who did not want to be identified said bin Zeid \"was killed on Wednesday in the line of duty as he was taking part in a humanitarian mission carried out by the Jordan Armed Forces in Afghanistan.\"\\n\\nThe Jordanian official added: \"Jordan\\'s position in the war on terror is clear; we are fully committed to fighting al Qaeda, which is a threat to Jordan as it is a threat to the United States. We are also committed to continuing our cooperation with the United States and the international community in the fight against terror and in defeating al Qaeda.\"\\n\\nIn a posting on its Web site last week, the Taliban in Afghanistan claimed the bomber was an Afghan National Army soldier.\\n\\nOn Sunday, however, Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud said in an e-mail that \"we claim the responsibility for the attack on the CIA in Afghanistan.\"\\n\\n\"The suicide bomber was a Jordanian national. This will be admitted by the CIA and the Jordanian government\" the message said.\\n\\nThe attack occurred at a forward operating base, which a U.S. intelligence official acknowledged was a crucial CIA post and a \"hub of activity.\" The main purpose of CIA forward operating bases in Afghanistan, officials have noted, is to recruit informants and to plan and coordinate covert operations, including drone surveillance and targeting.\\n\\nThe attack was \"a huge blow, symbolically and tactically,\" because it eliminated such a large number of CIA officers, who can require years to become ingrained in the region, said Reva Bhalla, director of analysis for STRATFOR -- an international intelligence company. In addition, the attack showed the ability of the Taliban to penetrate perhaps the most difficult of targets -- a CIA base, she said.\\n\\nFormer CIA official Robert Richer called it \"the greatest loss of life for the Central Intelligence Agency since the Beirut Embassy bombing\" in 1983, which killed eight agents.\\n\\nAn American intelligence official vowed last week that the United States would avenge the attack. Two of those killed were contractors with private security firm Xe, formerly known as Blackwater, a former intelligence official told CNN. The CIA considers contractors to be officers.\\n\\nOn Sunday, a local administration official and an intelligence official told CNN that two guided missiles struck a compound in the Pakistani village of Musaki in North Waziristan suspected of being a gathering place for local and foreign militants.\\n\\nThe attack killed Sadiq Noor, a teacher; his 9-year-old son; and three people from outside the country, according to the sources, who said the missiles were believed to have been fired by an unmanned drone. There was no immediate U.S. confirmation of the missile attack.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThe Citadel has concluded that cadets photographed wearing pillowcases in a manner reminiscent of Ku Klux Klan hoods did not mean to offend anyone, according to a Monday statement.\\n\\n“However,” said Lt. Gen. John Rosa, president of the public military college in South Carolina, “I am disappointed some recognized how it could be construed as such but didn’t stop it.”\\n\\nFourteen cadets were punished as a result of the investigation. The discipline ranges from “on-campus punishments” to two-semester dismissals from campus, The Citadel’s statement said.\\n\\nA photo of cadets in white pants and shirts wearing white pillowcases with eyeholes cut out sparked social media outrage on December 9. In the photo, which an upperclassman posted, the cadets are seen reading from sheets of paper, which The Citadel said Monday were lyrics sheets for Christmas songs.\\n\\nSeveral cadets reported to their leaders they had witnessed the event, and the cadet leaders reported the incident to a company tactical officer, who informed school administrators, The Citadel said.\\n\\nRosa launched an investigation the following morning, and eight cadets temporarily were suspended. After initial interviews, seven more cadets were investigated, the school said.\\n\\nThe investigation shows that several freshmen were told to report to an upperclassman’s room on numerous occasions after Thanksgiving break, where they were directed to sing Christmas carols in costume, the school said. It was the week before finals.\\n\\n“The freshmen used what they had close at hand, including pillowcases and other uniform items, in an attempt to dress as ‘Ghosts of Christmas Past,’ ” The Citadel statement said. “At the outset, not all of the freshmen understood that the costumes could be construed by some as offensive in nature. Those who did thought they could easily explain that they were only dressed as ghosts, and said they just needed to complete the skit so they could resume studying.”\\n\\nThe investigation’s findings mirror the results of a preliminary investigation. Rosa initially called the photo “disturbing” and said it wasn’t consistent with The Citadel’s values.\\n\\nIn Monday’s statement, he said, “While the skit had no ill intent, it did show poor judgment. It demonstrates that we must integrate an even higher level of diversity education into cadets’ daily activities, and into the already extensive leadership and ethics curriculum. We are working on that now.”\\n\\nThe cadets involved, he said, “now understand that the costumes could be considered offensive and hurtful to many.”\\n\\nRosa is creating a diversity task force, and cadets are already required to complete four years of leadership and ethics training, which includes lessons on racial sensitivity and ethical decision making, the school said.\\n\\nThe Citadel, founded in 1842, has about 2,300 undergraduates making up the Corps of Cadets, the school website says.',\n",
       " \"As a Sikh, Vishavjit Singh has found himself wrestling with the subject these past few days. “If this had happened at a mosque, would our reaction be different?” asked Mr. Singh, a software engineer in suburban New York who also publishes political cartoons online at Sikhtoons.com. “I hope not, but the answer might be yes. You’d have the same amount of coverage, but you might have more voices saying, ‘Well, you know, it’s understandable, we’re at war, we’ve been at war.’ That’s an unfortunate commentary on our society today.”\\n\\nThe paradox is that bias crimes against Muslims are growing a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks. The number of such instances, as tallied by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had been falling steadily from nearly 500 in 2001 to 107 in 2009. Then, in 2010, the most recent year for which the F.B.I. has data, the number leapt by 50 percent, to 160.\\n\\nThat spike does not look like either a mathematical or historical accident. During 2010, controversy erupted about the proposed “ground zero mosque,” which was actually a community center several blocks away. Prompted by several actual or attempted acts of terrorism by American Muslims, Representative Peter T. King began preparing for hearings in the spring of 2011 on supposedly widespread subversion among millions of American Muslims — an exercise in suspicion, if not guilt, by association.\\n\\nWhile those public pageants have largely subsided, there remain well-endowed groups like Jihad Watch, ACT for America and Stop Islamization of America. Several states have passed statutes outlawing the application of Shariah, and thus lending credence to the canard that American Muslims seek to impose their religious law. Representative Michele Bachmann, a former candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, recently accused a Muslim aide to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton of having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.\\n\\nSuch talk adds up to what John Shuford, the director of the Institute for Hate Studies at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash., calls “enmification” — the process of turning a particular group into an enemy. Now that American Muslims have been enmified, violence against them is understood in a mitigated, mediated way.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\n“Rationalization (or the capability of being rationalized) is a good way of putting it,” Professor Shuford wrote in an e-mail message. “Not in the sense of rational behavior or excusability, but in the sense of being understandable, in the way that sometimes leaps in logic, mistaken or misinformed beliefs, outright ignorance and prejudice, and influential social narratives can be quite intelligible even to those who do not view the world in the same way.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nJust one day after the shootings near Milwaukee, a mosque in Joplin, Mo., was burned down. Several weeks earlier, it had also been set afire. This latest episode was covered mostly by the local news media and The Associated Press, with a few larger organizations picking up the wire-service story.\\n\\nCertainly, an apparent bias crime against property, heinous as that is, does not compare in journalism’s calculus to the bigoted murder of six people. But it is at least worth pondering whether the Joplin arson also set off a kind of internal well-you-must-understand response.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

What started with the hatred of Muslims has repeatedly swept up Sikhs (and also, in some cases, Latinos) in its vortex.\\n\\n“For the Sikh community, it doesn’t matter that it was mistaken for being Muslim,” said Eric Ward, an expert in hate crimes who was formerly with an interfaith coalition called the Center for New Community. “What matters is that individuals should not be targeted for their faith.”\",\n",

Now, the Identitarians have established themselves as an alternative, aiming to be a “patriotic Greenpeace-type organization”, as their Vienna-branch leader Martin Sellner puts it.\\n\\nRecent stunts include blocking the A4 road near Nickelsdorf, occupying a border post in Salzburg, and building a border fence on the Austrian-Hungarian border.\\n\\nThe group says it has used social media to reach thousands of people since the start of the refugee crisis in September. They want Syrians to seek refuge in regions in the Middle East or North Africa. They claim that proceeds from their “border helper” (Grenzhelfer) stunts will be going to World Vision to support refugees in safe zones neighbouring Syria – rather than in Europe.\\n\\nAlexander Markovics, who heads up Austria’s Identitarian movement, believes that “Europe can never hope to solve the migrant crisis and world poverty through immigration”.\\n\\nHe claims it is short-sighted and culturally-destructive for all involved. “Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and other nearby countries are more logical destinations for them, and this is where Europe should be focusing aid efforts and diplomatic leverage,” he adds.\\n\\nWhile there is some disagreement on how to classify the Identitarian movement politically – whether it be far-right, right, or ‘new right’ – they represent something distinct from traditional right-wing groups of the post-war period.\\n\\nAs Europe becomes more polarized on issues of culture and migration, a part of Austrian society is seeing this position as more reasonable than they otherwise might have in the recent past.\\n\\nAccording to Julian Bruns, an expert on far-right movements, when talking about the Identitarians it is important to keep in mind that they don’t bring violence to the streets, instead it is their messages that present a danger because they know how to package them well.\\n\\nHe says that since the movement’s beginnings in France in 2012, it has been made up of students, not skinheads, who use popular culture and new right rhetoric to attract young adults to their movement.\\n\\nThe social anxiety over the migrant crisis that Austria’s Identitarians are tapping into, is also facilitating a boost in popularity for the Freedom Party. The FPO, campaigning to reduce immigration, could conceivably win a majority in Vienna’s October elections – something that would have been unthinkable a generation ago.\\n\\nMany Identitarians have links to the Freedom Party, and the FPO’s recent success in Upper Austria’s state elections was marked with jubilation on some of the movement’s social media profiles.\\n\\nPotentially even deeper than the divisions highlighted by the Greek debt crisis earlier this summer, the current refugee crisis has exposed profound differences among Europeans on the direction, role, and even definition of Europe.',\n",

       " 'Public fountains are dry in Barcelona, Spain, a city so parched thereâ€™s a â‚¬9,000 ($13,000) fine if youâ€™re caught watering your flowers. A tanker ship docked there this month carrying 5 million gallons of precious fresh water â€“ and officials are scrambling to line up more such shipments to slake public thirst.\\n\\n!ADVERTISEMENT!\\n\\nBarcelona is not alone. Cyprus will ferry water from Greece this summer. Australian cities are buying water from that nationâ€™s farmers and building desalination plants. Thirsty China plans to divert Himalayan water. And 18 million southern Californians are bracing for their first water-rationing in years.\\n\\nWater, Dow Chemical Chairman Andrew Liveris told the World Economic Forum in February, â€œis the oil of this century.â€\\x9d Developed nations have taken cheap, abundant fresh water largely for granted. Now global population growth, pollution, and climate change are shaping a new view of water as â€œblue gold.â€\\x9d\\n\\nWaterâ€™s hot-commodity status has snared the attention of big equipment suppliers like General Electric as well as big private water companies that buy or manage municipal supplies â€“ notably France-based Suez and Aqua America, the largest US-based private water company.\\n\\nGlobal water markets, including drinking water distribution, management, waste treatment, and agriculture are a nearly $500 billion market and growing fast, says a 2007 global investment report.\\n\\nBut governments pushing to privatize costly to maintain public water systems are colliding with a global â€œwater is a human rightâ€\\x9d movement. Because water is essential for human life, its distribution is best left to more publicly accountable government authorities to distribute at prices the poorest can afford, those water warriors say.\\n\\nâ€œWeâ€™re at a transition point where fundamental decisions need to be made by societies about how this basic human need â€“ water â€“ is going to be provided,â€\\x9d says Christopher Kilian, clean-water program director for the Boston-based Conservation Law Foundation. â€œThe profit motive and basic human need [for water] are just inherently in conflict.â€\\x9d\\n\\nWill â€œpeak waterâ€\\x9d displace â€œpeak oilâ€\\x9d as the central resource question? Some see such a scenario rising.\\n\\nâ€œWhatâ€™s different now is that itâ€™s increasingly obvious that weâ€™re running up against limits to new [fresh water] supplies,â€\\x9d says Peter Gleick, a watÂ\\xadÂ\\xadÂ\\xader expert and president of the Pacific InÂ\\xadÂ\\xadÂ\\xadstiÂ\\xadÂ\\xadtute for Studies in Development, EnÂ\\xadÂ\\xadviÂ\\xadÂ\\xadÂ\\xadronÂ\\xadÂ\\xadment, and SecÂ\\xadÂ\\xadurÂ\\xadÂ\\xadity, a nonpartisan think tank in OakÂ\\xadland, Calif. â€œItâ€™s no longÂ\\xadÂ\\xader cheap and easy to drill another well or dam another river.â€\\x9d\\n\\nRead the full article here',\n",
       " 'On MSNBC last night, Rachel Maddow looked at the political rationale behind the White House decision to make House Speaker Wanna-Be John Boehner, R-Ohio, the face of the “Party of No” in the midterm elections.\\n\\nBoehner was chosen, in part, because he is a boozey, overly tanned cartoonish character, but mainly because he was the GOP leader in 2008, back when it was the Bush rubberstamp party. In late September 2008, when the United States financial system was in freefall, Boehner took to the well of the House and tearfully begged the Republican caucus to support the Bush bank bailout of Wall Street and the “too big to fail” banks, officially known as the “Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008”:\\n\\nREP. JOHN BOEHNER, MINORITY LEADER: Think about what happens if we don’t pass this bill, think about what happens to your friends, your neighbors, your constituents. So, I ask all of you, both sides of the aisle: what’s in the best interest of our country? Not what’s in the best interest of our party, not what’s in the best interest of our own re- election– what’s in the best interest of our country? Vote yes.\\n\\nThe bailout eventually passed both houses of Congress, with over 90 Republicans in the House and 33 GOP senators voting yes. (There’s a complete list at the below.) The vote was taken before the rise of the GOP’s astroturfed tea party mobs and their virulent opposition to Obama policies — particularly the government funding of programs intended to resolve the financial collapse brought on by the Bush Recession.\\n\\nSince the rise of tea baggery, many, if not most, of the Republicans in Congress have made a spectacle of themselves by desperately kowtowing to the mob, so it is surprising to see many of their names on the list of Republicans who voted “aye” on the tea baggers’ much-despised Wall Street Bailout.\\n\\nIn the Senate, as Maddow pointed out, the bailout was strongly supported by then-presidential candidate John McCain, along with his running mate, Facebook blogger Sarah Palin. A week or so prior to his vote for Bush’s bailout, McCain had humiliated himself by declaring that the “fundamentals of our economy are strong” just hours before word came that the stock market had collapsed and the entire U.S. and world financial systems were in meltdown.\\n\\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., voted for the bailout, as did his minority whip, Jon Kyl of Arizona, and McCain’s friend Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\\n\\nScandal figures Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John Ensign, R-Nev., the C Street Christian center members who are subjects of an investigation into Ensign’s pay-offs to the husband of his mistress, also voted yes.\\n\\nRight-wing extremist senators Christopher Bond, R-Mo.; Richard Burr, R-N.C., who is up for reelection; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa (who humiliated himself by standing silent after a town-hall meeting tea bagger volunteered to assassinate Pres. Obama); and Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson of Georgia all voted yes.\\n\\nTwo senators who voted yes — Bob Bennett, R-Utah, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska — lost their primaries because of tea bagger anger, in part, because they voted for Bush’s bailout Wall Street.\\n\\nIn the House, members of the GOP leadership who voted for the bailout include Speaker Wanna-Be Boehner and Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va. The GOP’s young financial “expert” Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., voted yes. House members then who are running for the Senate now who voted for the bailout include Roy Blunt, R-Mo., John Boozman, R-Ark., Mike Castle, R-D.E.; and Mark Kirk, R-Ill.\\n\\nThe list of nutty and outspoken former and current House members associated with tea bagger mobs includes immigrant-bashing former Colorada Rep. Tom Tancredo, who is now running as a third-party candidate for governor; Rep. Joe “You Lie!” Wilson of South Carolina; and Rep. Wally Herger, the Mormon businessman from California who later made national news by telling a tea bagger who referred to himself as a “proud right-wing terrorist” that he was a “great American.”\\n\\nTranscript:\\n\\nMADDOW: But, we begin with what is known in American politics as a soft target.\\n\\nREP. JOHN BOEHNER, MINORITY LEADER: Think about what happens if we don’t pass this bill, think about what happens to your friends, your neighbors, your constituents. So, I ask all of you, both sides of the aisle: what’s in the best interest of our country? Not what’s in the best interest of our party, not what’s in the best interest of our own re- election– what’s in the best interest of our country? Vote yes.\\n\\nMADDOW: That was the top Republican in the House, John Boehner, getting emotional, getting choked up while speaking on the House floor. Keep that in mind as you watch this — the newly unveiled first campaign ad of the season from the National Republican Congressional Committee. It’s an ad that targets a Democratic congressman named Joe Donnelly from Indiana. This appears to be their template ad so you should watch what they’re attacking the Democrat here for.\\n\\nNARRATOR: Joe Donnelly claims he’s independent. But he’s voted with Nancy Pelosi 88 percent of the time, for the Obama/ Pelosi health care plan, the Wall Street bailout.\\n\\nMADDOW: The Wall Street bailout. OK. Here’s the problem right now, if you’re the Republican Party. Here’s the problem if you are the Republican Party trying to figure out the message that you are going to try to win on in November. If you want to run against the Wall Street bailout, first of all, you have to run against the fact that almost all of the Wall Street bailout money has been paid back. Second of all, we awkwardly still do have a financial system in America which at one point was not a foregone conclusion, which is why we got the bailout in the first place. But most acutely, in political terms, if you want the Republican Party to run against the Wall Street bailout in this year’s elections, how do you handle the fact that the Wall Street bailout was substantially a Republican policy? It was put into place under Republican President George W. Bush and his treasury secretary, Hank Paulson. It was given the seal of approval from Republican presidential candidate John McCain. You will recall that he suspended his presidential campaign and rushed back to Washington to make sure the bailout passed. Mr. McCain’s running mate, Sarah Palin, right there with him on the bailout.\\n\\nSARAH PALIN(R), FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR: The bailout provisions and the measures that have already been taken, it is a time of crisis and government did have to step in playing an appropriate role. Government did have to step in there.\\n\\nMADDOW: The National Republican Campaign Committee, which is now running ads against the bailout, is headed by a man named Republican Congressman Pete Sessions of Texas. Pete Sessions of Texas cast a vote for the bailout back in 2008. As Republicans try to cast themselves as the party ready to take over Washington, to take the country back from the horrible, horrible Democrats and their horrible, horrible Democratic policies like that horrible, horrible Democratic bailout, here is the Republican Party’s speaker in waiting as they keep calling him now, John Boehner– a man who not only voted for the bailout but grew teary-eyed on the floor of the House while beseeching his fellow Republicans that they should vote for it, too.\\n\\nBOEHNER: So, I ask all of you, both sides of the aisle: what’s in the best interests of our country? Not what’s in the best interests of our party, not what’s in the best interests of our own re- election– what’s in the best interests of our country? Vote yes.\\n\\nMADDOW: Vote yes. That’s John Boehner imploring Republicans to vote for the bailout as Republicans now try to campaign on how much they were against the bailout. This is not ancient history. This is not one of those unknown knowns. You can look this stuff up. It’s in Google news still. There’s tape. John Boehner crying over how much he wants the bailout is one giant awkwardness for Republicans as they try to put together their message for this fall and they want it to be an anti- bailout message. It also explains why Democrats, at the start of the campaign season, seem to have found a very, very, very clear point of focus for their Democratic political message.\\n\\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Mr. Boehner and Republicans in Congress– Mr. Boehner and his allies — when Mr. Boehner was here in Cleveland– let me be clear to Mr. Boehner and everybody else– Mr. Boehner dismissed these jobs we saved — Mr. Boehner has, so far, said no to infrastructure. When these same Republicans, including Mr. Boehner, were in charge — there were no new policies for Mr. Boehner–\\n\\nMADDOW: President Obama today in Cleveland, Ohio, delivering what was billed as a major speech on the economy and using that platform to call out John Boehner by name over and over and over again — almost as if the two men were facing off against each other on the ballot in this year’s elections. A few hours before President Obama’s speech today, the chairman of the Democratic Party, Tim Kaine, expanded on the ” John Boehner, John Boehner, John Boehner” thing.\\n\\nTIM KAINE, DNC CHAIRMAN: Mr. Boehner led Republican opposition to legislation important in Pennsylvania and Virginia and elsewhere that helps states in a tough time keep teachers, firefighters, and policemen on the job. This is the same John Boehner who infamously handed out tobacco company campaign checks to Republican members of Congress on the floor of the House of Representatives a couple years ago and plotted with the Wall Street lobbyists to block financial reform.\\n\\nMADDOW: Around the same time that Democratic Party Chairman Tim Kaine was blasting ” John Boehner, John Boehner, John Boehner” in Philadelphia, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office was churning out this fact sheet on ” John Boehner, John Boehner, John Boehner,” and his policy proposals that they calculate would add $4.2 trillion to the deficit. Democrats know that history over all is against them for this year’s elections. The president’s party always loses seats in the first election of a new president’s first term. Democrats also know that the strongest wind blowing against them right now is that the economy is really bad and voters vote against the party in power when the economy is bad. So they know they have to talk about the economy. They know they have to campaign very aggressively, that the odds start out against them. So, Democrats are making the case that Republicans are campaigning against policies that they supported. Democrats are making the case that Republicans say they’re fiscally conservative, but they want to give millions of dollars to the richest people in the country without paying for it, just larding that onto the deficit. If you are the Democrats, you can make all those policy points you want, but in the campaign year, what you really want is to have all of the bad things you want to say about the other party personified in one very easily caricatured opponent.\\n\\nOBAMA: To most of you, I’ll bet this just seems like common sense. But not to Mr. Boehner and his allies.\\n\\nMADDOW: It is Barack Obama versus John Boehner in 2010. We speculated this might be it before. Now, as of today, Democrats are leaving no ambiguity. This is their frame — Barack Obama versus John Boehner. The Beltway media says this is elevating John Boehner. But Democrats aren’t promoting him. They’re not changing his job title. They’re just trying to make sure that this year, this campaign season, John Boehner is very, very, very, very famous.',\n",
       " 'Liu Yiqian, a billionaire Chinese investor, recently purchased a Modigliani painting for $170.4 million, putting him in an elite club of rich people who paid a lot of money for art.\\n\\nBuried in the New York Times story about his purchase and life was an interesting detail about his motivation for the Modigliani purchase:\\n\\nThere is another, more personal, benefit to the acquisition: airfare. Ms. Wang confirmed that, as in the past, she and Mr. Liu would be using their American Express card to pay for the Modigliani. That way, with the cardholder’s points they accrue, their whole family — the couple, their four children and two grandchildren — can continue flying for free. “We are on a one-year payment plan for the painting,” Ms. Wang said. “If we had to pay cash upfront, that would be a little difficult for us.” She added: “I mean, who has the money for that?”\\n\\nIndeed!\\n\\nYiqian has done this before: He accrued 422 million points with Amex for buying an ancient ceramic cup last year, according to Bloomberg. He\\'s also bought other art, partly for Amex points.\\n\\nI called American Express to find out more about the details of that kind of transaction.\\n\\nSpokeswoman Marina Norville told me that she could not talk about any individual\\'s purchases or account. However, Amex does offer charge cards that have no \"preset\" spending limits. In other words, it is possible to charge $170.4 million on one, as long as you can prove you have the ability to repay it.\\n\\nNorville said it\\'s hard to calculate the kind of points a hypothetical customer would accrue with that kind of purchase, though. It depends on the card, depends on the customer and depends on the merchant. Some cards have generous rewards that are capped at a certain level, and some merchants have special deals with Amex.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAs far as art galleries go, Sotheby\\'s has something of a love-hate relationship with Amex, having dumped the card in the 90s, and then charged customers an extra fee for using it. The Modigliani auction Yiqian won on Nov. 9 was with Christie\\'s.\\n\\nI oversee Fusion\\'s money section and have spent most of my time as a journalist writing about banks and finance.

       " 'Ukraine’s Energoatom And South Korea’s KHNP Sign Cooperation Agreement\\n\\n(NucNet) Ukraine’s national nuclear energy generating company Energoatom and South Korea’s nuclear operator Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power (KHNP) have signed a memorandum of understanding aiming to improve bilateral cooperation in the nuclear industry.\\n\\nThe main focus of the cooperation efforts will include the completion of Units 3 and 4 of the Khmelnitski nuclear power station in western Ukraine. Both reactors are Russian designed VVERs. Work began on them in the 1980s, but they remain less than half built.\\n\\nSok Cho, chief executive of KHNP, said he remains “firmly convinced” that the completion of Khmelnitski-3 and -4 “will be successful” if Energoatom and KHNP “work together toward a common goal.”\\n\\nThere are several reasons to be skeptical about the deal.\\n\\nAbility of Ukraine to pay for the reactors. The country can’t or won’t pay for Russian gas.\\n\\nSupply Chain in Ukraine and use of Odessa as port of entry for large components. The Russians are not going to sell components to the South Korean EPC.\\n\\nOngoing Russian sponsored military hostilities in eastern provinces which have the objective of destabilizing the current Ukrainian government.\\n\\nAs for what South Korea is thinking, here are a few ideas.\\n\\nBased on its success in the UAE, S. Korea feels that they are up to any challenge including dealing with all the dysfunctional forces in Ukraine.\\n\\nS. Korea has mis-read or does not take seriously Russia’s intentions to recapture the Ukraine breadbasket before China finishes buying all of its output.\\n\\nMemorandums for cooperation among nations on nuclear energy are a dime a dozen and timeless in that they have infinite shelf life with no money changing hands. S. Korea also inked this week a similar agreement with Kenya.\\n\\nS. Korea’s counterparts in Ukraine having inked a deal for a nuclear fuel plant with Westinghouse last April now feel confident to finish the two partially built reactors since the plant will provide reliable fuel services for it and their other 15 reactors.\\n\\nUkraine To continue efforts to diversify nuclear supplies / services\\n\\n(NucNet) Ukraine’s national nuclear operator Energoatom will continue to diversify its supply of nuclear materials and services, Yuri Nedashkovsky, Energoatom’s president, was quoted as saying in a statement on the company’s website.\\n\\nMr Nedashkovsky spoke at a media briefing after Energoatom and the Anglo-German-Dutch company Urenco signed a contract for Urenco to supply uranium enrichment services to Ukraine.

       " 'This article is about the 1889 painting. For the similar 1888 Van Gogh painting, see Starry Night Over the Rhône\\n\\nThe Starry Night is an oil on canvas by the Dutch post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an idealized village.[1][2][3] It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Regarded as among Van Gogh\\'s finest works,[4] The Starry Night is one of the most recognized paintings in the history of Western culture.[5][6]\\n\\nThe asylum [ edit ]\\n\\nThe Monastery of Saint-Paul de Mausole\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of his left ear,[7][8] Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889.[9][10] Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived,[11] allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.[12]\\n\\nDuring the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued.[13] During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the blue self-portrait from September, 1889, in the Musée d\\'Orsay. The Starry Night was painted mid-June by around 18 June, the date he wrote to his brother Theo to say he had a new study of a starry sky.[1][14][15][L 1]\\n\\nThe painting [ edit ]\\n\\nAlthough The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh\\'s ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory. The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east,[1][2][16][17] a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times,[citation needed] including The Starry Night. \"Through the iron-barred window,\" he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, \"I can see an enclosed square of wheat . . . above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory.\"[2][L 2]\\n\\nVan Gogh depicted the view at different times of day and under various weather conditions, including sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain. While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper; eventually he would base newer variations on previous versions. The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains. In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field. Van Gogh telescoped the view in six of these[vague] paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.[citation needed]\\n\\nOne of the first paintings of the view was F611 Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Rémy, now in Copenhagen. Van Gogh made a number of sketches for the painting, of which F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm is typical. It is unclear whether the painting was made in his studio or outside. In his June 9 letter describing it, he mentions he had been working outside for a few days.[18][19][L 3][14] Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889.[18][L 4] This is F719 Green Field, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted outside en plein air.[18] F1548 Wheat field, Saint-Rémy de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it. Two days later, Vincent wrote Theo that he had painted \"a starry sky\".[20][L 1]\\n\\nThe Starry Night is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window. In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\"[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible. So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer\\'s right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.[14][16]\\n\\nThe Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[14] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh\\'s Moon would not have been astronomically correct. (For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.) The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh\\'s cell is the village,[21] which is based on a sketch F1541v made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Rémy.[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provençal, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.[1] Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse F1541r was also a study for the painting.[22]\\n\\nInterpretations [ edit ]\\n\\nDespite the large number of letters Van Gogh wrote, he said very little about The Starry Night.[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"[23] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\"; \"the rest\" would include The Starry Night. When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he didn\\'t send.[24] Finally, in a letter to painter Émile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"[25]\\n\\nVan Gogh argued with Bernard and, especially, Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[26] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[27] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de tête.[28] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the fall and winter of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know. . . . But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall. . . . And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big—another failure—and I have had my fill of that.\"[29] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.[30]\\n\\nTheo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"[25] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can\\'t do anything about it. But am inclined to believe that in the long run you\\'d get used to it.\" And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren\\'t what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"[31]\\n\\nBut although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[32] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.[33] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series. He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Rémy. The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[34] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.\\n\\nThe nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.e., at night.[35] The first painting in the series was Café Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night Over the Rhone later that same month. Van Gogh\\'s written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.\\n\\nSoon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I . . . need a starry night with cypresses or—perhaps above a field of ripe wheat; there are some really beautiful nights here.\" That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"[36] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"[37] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[38][39] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife. He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rhone, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word—for religion—so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"[40]\\n\\nHe wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky. \"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"[41] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"[36] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"[42]\\n\\nNoted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"[43] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[43] of the work makes reference to the New Testament book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"[44] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[45] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)[46]\\n\\nArt historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro\\'s approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"[47] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh\\'s incapacitating breakdowns.[48] Loevgren compares Van Gogh\\'s \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.[49] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"[50] Loevgren praises Schapiro\\'s \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[51] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph\\'s dreams in the Old Testament book of Genesis.[52] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"[53]\\n\\nArt historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[56] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh\\'s] deepest religious feelings.\"[57] Citing Van Gogh\\'s avowed admiration for the paintings of Eugène Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter\\'s use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.[58] He criticizes Schapiro\\'s and Loevgren\\'s biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the sun. He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"[59]\\n\\nIt is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting. As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh\\'s view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.[16] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.[21] He recounts Van Gogh\\'s interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.[60] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh\\'s lifetime.\\n\\nBoime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[61] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion\\'s popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes. Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.[21] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky. These swirls represent Van Gogh\\'s understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.[62]\\n\\nHarvard astronomer Charles A. Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of The Starry Night contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.C.L.A.).[63] While Whitney does not share Boime\\'s certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[64] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.[14] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, Lord Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.[65]\\n\\nWhitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.[17] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)[66] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.[21]\\n\\nThe village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh\\'s Dutch homeland,[1][67] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Rémy.[3][21] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.\\n\\nCypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate. In an April 1888, letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[68] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\" One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts. I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"[69] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"[70] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.\\n\\nSchapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"[43] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh\\'s own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"[61] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"[71] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.) Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"[53]\\n\\nArt historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an \\'abstraction\\'.\"[72] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh\\'s room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh\\'s imagination.[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[16] as does Jirat-Wasiutyński.[73] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[20] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the morning star. Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of planet.\\n\\nSoth uses Van Gogh\\'s statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"[74] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\" Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\" The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects. What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.\\n\\nOn two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term. In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens. As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I’ve never devised anything better.\"[75] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.) And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished. Ah, you’re exchanging that for something — must one say the word — something artificial — something affected.\"[76][77]\\n\\nWhen Van Gogh calls The Starry Night a failure for being an \"abstraction,\" he places the blame on his having painted \"stars that are too big.\"\\n\\nWhile stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh\\'s mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.[78] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse (\\'the falling sickness\\', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy—a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"[79] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"[30]\\n\\nVan Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.[66] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"[80] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[81] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"[30]\\n\\nProvenance [ edit ]\\n\\nAfter having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.[24][72] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891. Theo\\'s widow, Jo, then became the caretaker of Van Gogh\\'s legacy. She sold the painting to poet Julien Leclercq in Paris in 1900, who turned around and sold it to Émile Schuffenecker, Gauguin\\'s old friend, in 1901. Jo then bought the painting back from Schuffenecker before selling it to the Oldenzeel Gallery in Rotterdam in 1906. From 1906 to 1938 it was owned by Georgette P. van Stolk, of Rotterdam, who sold it to Paul Rosenberg, of Paris and New York. It was through Rosenberg that the Museum of Modern Art acquired the painting in 1941.[82]\\n\\nPainting materials [ edit ]\\n\\nThe painting was investigated by the scientists at the Rochester Institute of Technology and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.[83] The pigment analysis has shown that the sky was painted with ultramarine and cobalt blue and for the stars and the Moon van Gogh employed the rare pigment indian yellow together with zinc yellow.[84]\\n\\nDetails of Van Gogh\\'s The Starry Night exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art of New York.\\n\\nexhibited at the Museum of Modern Art of New York.

       " 'Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.\\n\\nOn Sept. 8, 1862, more than 40 ministers in Chicago signed a nine-page “Memorial of all Christian Denominations,” urging Lincoln to emancipate the slaves on moral and religious grounds, which two of them, the Rev. William W. Patton and the Rev. John Dempster, personally delivered to Lincoln five days later. The three had a long conversation, which the ministers duly reported back to their colleagues and which was later published in The Chicago Tribune and other papers.\\n\\nIn their conversation, Lincoln explained why he could not emancipate the slaves of the South, a response that illustrates his political shrewdness in moving the United States to accept the necessity of emancipation and the moral necessity of converting the war for union into a war for freedom.\\n\\nThe ministers urged Lincoln to emancipate the slaves because, they said, it would comport with God’s will. Never a churchgoer and not formally religious, Lincoln nevertheless understood the power of faith and the importance of having the support of religious leaders. He began by saying that he was bombarded by advice from “religious men” about “Divine will,” but that the advice was conflicting. Lincoln suggested that if “God would reveal his will to others, on a point so connected with my duty, it might be supposed he would reveal it directly to me.” But in fact he had had no divine revelation. If he did, he would certainly do what the Lord asked, but Lincoln reminded the ministers that “These are not” the “days of miracles.” Lincoln could not look to religion or the divine will to determine how to deal with slavery. He had to look to more practical issues.\\n\\nLincoln then set out the problems associated with emancipation. He asked the ministers “what good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do” given the current military situation. In a brilliant moment, he said: “I do not want to issue a document that the world will see must necessarily be inoperative, like the pope’s bull against the comet.” This was a reference to Pope Calixtus III, who, in 1456, allegedly issued a Papal Bull ordering Halley’s comet not to come to earth; Lincoln did not want to issue a proclamation that he, like Calixtus, could not enforce.\\n\\nBut to make sure the ministers understood his position, Lincoln clarified the point: “Would my word free the slaves, when I cannot even enforce the Constitution in the rebel states?” In other words, he couldn’t move against slavery until he was in a position to enforce his will with military power. This point turns the traditional view of emancipation upside down. Lincoln was not willing to issue a proclamation from weakness – as a desperate measure to win the war – but only from a position of strength, when he felt he could actually win the war and preserve the freedom of the former slaves.\\n\\nLincoln told the ministers he saw no legal or constitutional problems with freeing the slaves in the Confederacy in his capacity “as commander in chief of the Army and Navy, in time of war.” On the contrary, he said, “I suppose I have a right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy.” And he assured the ministers he had no “objections of a moral nature” to ending slavery. But a premature emancipation might push Kentucky into the Confederacy and remove “50,000 bayonets in the Union armies from the Border States.”\\n\\nFreeing the slaves in loyal and occupied states would lead to massive dislocations of population, force the Army to feed thousands of black refugees and distract his troops from the war effort. Nor could he arm the slaves, because they were not prepared to be soldiers and “thus far we have not had arms enough to equip our white troops”; he also worried that if black troops were captured they would be re-enslaved. Lincoln ended this meeting by assuring the ministers that the issue of emancipation “is on my mind, by day and night, more than any other.”\\n\\nOn Sept. 20, Patton and Dempster reported the substance of the conversation, with many direct quotations from Lincoln, to a meeting of ministers in Chicago. Doubtless, they were encouraged by Lincoln’s admission that he saw no legal problem with emancipation and that he had “not decided against an emancipation,” even as they were doubtless discouraged that he held “the matter under advisement.”\\n\\nRelated Civil War Timeline An unfolding history of the Civil War with photos and articles from the Times archive and ongoing commentary from Disunion contributors. Visit the Timeline »\\n\\nMost of Lincoln’s arguments against emancipation seem, in retrospect, designed to encourage the ministers to publicly advocate for emancipation, rather than to discourage their support. This was doubtless part of Lincoln’s strategy to build support in the North for a full-scale assault on the institution. Lincoln’s arguments about black troops were misleading, because by this time he had already authorized his generals on South Carolina’s Sea Islands to begin training and arming former slaves.\\n\\nSimilarly, while expressing fear that Kentucky might join the Confederacy, Lincoln surely knew better, since the state’s secessionist governor, Beriah Magoffin, had just resigned and fled to the Confederacy. Kentucky was militarily and politically secure, but Lincoln did not need to acknowledge that at this time.\\n\\nMost important, what the ministers could not know was that Lincoln had already written the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and gained the support of his entire cabinet to issue it at the appropriate moment. In fact, he was to release it two days after they reported back to their colleagues in Chicago.\\n\\nLincoln’s response to the ministers was part of his strategy of preparing the North for emancipation and increasing support for it. He knew where he was headed, but in mid-September, he could not reveal his plans to the ministers, and of course couldn’t know when he would be able to move against slavery.\\n\\nHe was soon able to make that move. On Sept. 17, just four days after the meeting with ministers, the United States Army won its first major battle in the Eastern campaign, defeated Gen. Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia in a decisive battle at Antietam. This was the big victory Lincoln was waiting for. Five days later, on Sept. 22, he issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. The war for the Union was about to become the war for freedom.\\n\\nJoin Disunion on Facebook »\\n\\nPaul Finkelman is the John Hope Franklin visiting professor of American legal history at Duke Law School and the President William McKinley distinguished professor of law and public policy at Albany Law School.',\n",
       " 'I realize that some of you are most likely wondering, “Why is he not writing about the Baltimore situation?”\\n\\nBecause, quite frankly, I believe that is a total waste of time. Like I wrote about the local story here about the guy who got shot by the feds here, when they were trying to arrest him:\\n\\nThe man was armed with a hammer, he tried to attack a federal officer, and he got shot. Just another day in the big city. But, as you know, because he is black, as was the agent that shot him; because of the stuff happening everywhere now, the left and their media lap-dogs are going to exploit this, in hopes that there is another riot in Detroit. Because that, is what marxists do. Marxists exploit stuff like this to disrupt the system. You watch and see, summer is coming and Detroit has a white mayor. You watch, another uprising is coming and the marxists will be in the middle of it.\\n\\nDespite the fact that 3 of the officers involved in the situation in Baltimore were black, like here in Detroit where the fed agent was black, who shot the suspect — none of that matters. It is going to be portrayed as a evil white police force or in the case here in Detroit as a evil white Government killing blacks.\\n\\nIt is especially hazardous to one’s well being and livelihood, if you happen to be white and have an opinion that is not a part of the demented liberal socialist marxist politically correct stripe. Which is something Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Teana Walsh found out the hard way:\\n\\nDays after posting her opinion on how to deal with protesters and looters in Baltimore, Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Teana Walsh resigned. Walsh, 35, did not make public comments about her resignation. The resignation was sent to Prosecutor Kym Worthy Friday afternoon in response to push back for her Facebook post about shooting people in Baltimore. Her post, from April 27, read in part “So I am watching the news in Baltimore and see large swarms of people throwing bricks, etc at police who are fleeing from their assaults … 15 in the hospital already.” “Solution. Simple. Shoot em. Period. End of discussion. I don’t care what causes the protesters to turn violent…what the ‘they did it because’ reason is…no way is this acceptable. Flipping disgusting.” Walsh, who was on maternity leave, was set to be disciplined for the post. Instead she voluntarily resigned. “This afternoon Assistant Prosecutor Teana Walsh called Prosecutor Kym Worthy to announce that she is voluntarily resigning her position with the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office,” spokeswoman Maria Miller said in a release. “During her tenure in the office, Teana Walsh has been known for her great work ethic and her compassion for victims of crime and their families. Her post was up online briefly and she immediately took it down. The post was completely out of character for her and certainly does not reflect the person that we know.” Worthy called the potential discipline an “internal matter,” and didn’t say what it would have been. Activist group Progress Michigan released a statement about the incident calling into question all of Walsh’s work with the department. “Kym Worthy must conduct a thorough review of Walsh’s conduct,” Lonnie Scott, executive director for Progress Michigan said in a release. “For an assistant county prosecutor to call for the summary execution of disenfranchised and angered citizens shows she has little regard for justice or due process.” The organization claims it “holds public officials and government accountable,” in its mission statement.\\n\\nJust so everyone knows Teana Walsh looks like this:\\n\\nSo, white people cannot have an opinion, that truly is a righteous opinion about what happened in Baltimore? It sure appears that way. But then again, that is what happens when you let Marxists rule the Country.\\n\\nUpdate: Teana Walsh’s part of this story, is now a Memeorandum thread, with the usual left-wing suspects weighing in.',\n",

       " 'South Korea’s Chung Mong-joon has said he is facing a 15-year suspension by Fifa’s Ethics Committee, hampering his campaign for the Fifa presidency, but he has denied any wrongdoing and vowed to continue with his bid to lead football’s world governing body.\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeaking at a news conference in Seoul on Tuesday, Chung read out a nine-page statement, addressing the accusations against him, which he dismissed as a ploy “to prevent me from running for the president of Fifa”.\\n\\nAdidas refuse to join in call for Fifa’s Sepp Blatter to stand down Read more\\n\\nChung said the charges against him stemmed from his “support” for South Korea’s 2022 World Cup bid when he proposed the launch of a Global Football Fund. Chung said his proposals were in line with Fifa’s rules and had already been investigated and cleared but he was being targeted because he was running for the Fifa presidency.\\n\\n“The fundamental reason why I am being targeted is that I aimed straight at the existing power structure of Fifa,” Chung said. The scion of Korea’s Hyundai industrial conglomerate, Chung vowed to fight the charges, adding “ultimately, I will prevail and will be vindicated.“\\n\\nIn November, Chung was named in Fifa’s ethics report into the bidding process for the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, in which South Korea made a bid to host. The report followed an investigation led by US lawyer Michael Garcia and looked into letters that Chung sent, in late 2010, to Fifa executive committee members about a proposal to establish a “Global Football Fund” for football development.\\n\\n“According to those letters, Korea intended to raise $777m from 2011 to build new football infrastructure and renovate existing facilities,” said the report, which added that the fund was linked to South Korea’s 2022 bid.\\n\\nChung, a 63-year-old billionaire who previously served as a Fifa vice-president, formally announced in August that he was running for the Fifa presidency. The incumbent, Sepp Blatter, is to stand down in February. Chung has been heavily critical of Blatter, who has run Fifa for the past 17 years and recently become the focus of a criminal investigation. Blatter has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crimes.\\n\\nChung said at the outset of his campaign that he feared Blatter would sabotage his bid, describing the Ethics Committee as Blatter’s “hitman”. “The true danger is that they are not only sabotaging my candidacy. They are sabotaging Fifa’s election and Fifa itself,” Chung said. “As preposterous as it may sound, there are media reports that Mr Blatter plans to stay on as president once all the presidential candidates are forced out. However, the election is in danger of being turned into a farce.”\\n\\nHe also revealed details about a meeting with England 2018’s former bid leader and Fifa vice-president Geoff Thompson, Prince William and Prime Minister David Cameron.\\n\\nThe statement adds: “The Investigatory Chamber (IC) initially thought that they had a strong case against me. One of the questions that the IC sent me on February 13, 2015 was the following: ’Would it surprise you to learn that the Chairman of England 2018, Mr Geoff Thompson has admitted to agreeing to trade your vote for Korea 2022, in exchange for England’s vote for Korea 2022?’\\n\\n“This allegedly happened when I last met Mr Geoff Thompson when together we paid a courtesy visit on Prince William at the Prince’s request in his suite at Baur au Lac Hotel in Zurich on December 1, 2010, one day before the vote. When I went to the Prince’s suite, Prime Minister Cameron was also there.”\\n\\nChung said he was sent a transcript of Thompson’s “rather incoherent interview” with ethics investigator Michael Garcia.\\n\\nHe added: “In the transcript, Mr Thompson does not even remember whether Prince William was present when he and I and PM Cameron were allegedly making this deal.\\n\\n“My question is, ’Is it even conceivable that Mr Thompson and I would be making an illicit ’vote trading’ deal in such company? Is Fifa accusing Prince William and the Prime Minister of Great Britain of being complicit in vote trading the day before the vote? If so, they should be investigating the Prince and PM Cameron as well.”\\n\\nChung said the vote-trading charge was then dropped and that it only came about as a result of Thompson needing “someone to blame” after the “major embarrassment” of only securing one vote.\\n\\nHe also questioned why Fifa’s ethics committee had not taken action against Blatter over the ISL bribery case – where he did not investigate bribes being paid to senior officials – or secretary general Valcke, who was said in a US court to have lied repeatedly to card giants Mastercard in order to secure a sponsorship deal with Visa.\\n\\nChung added: “If the ethics committee was truly independent, it should have banned Mr Blatter for life for the ISL case 20 years ago. Both Mr Blatter and Mr Valcke should have been banned for life for their manipulation of the Visa-MasterCard case.”',\n",
       " \"What does my 14,000-person rural town in upstate New York have in common with Los Angeles, one of the country’s largest metropolitan areas?\\n\\nWe’re both standing up to the oil and gas industry. And we’re winning.\\n\\nIn 2011, our local town board voted to ban fracking within our town borders—one of the first towns in New York to do so:\\n\\nThis month, Los Angeles leaders took a similarly courageous stand, passing a moratorium that would prohibit fracking within city limits unless studies show the practice would not harm the health of their community or their water supply.\\n\\nIn doing so, Los Angeles joined a coast-to-coast groundswell aimed at protecting people from the consequences of the fracking-enabled oil and gas rush. Last week, Santa Barbara residents announced they’re kicking off a petition drive for a fracking ban initiative.\\n\\nCommunities all over the U.S. have good reason to be concerned: Fracking, a process used to extract oil and gas from shale rock formations, has been associated with poisoned water, air pollution, and serious health problems, not to mention animal deaths and industrial disasters and explosions. Some of the hazardous substances associated with the practice include: cancer-causing benzene and deadly hydrogen sulfide. Many more of the hundreds of chemicals used in the fracking process are never revealed to the public even if there is an accident.\\n\\nIn spite of the risks, fracking has been deregulated to an alarming degree. The oil and gas industry has gained exemptions from critical portions of key federal laws designed to protect public health and the environment, including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To Know Act. And in California, the state legislature passed and Gov. Gerry Brown signed a weak bill allowing fracking to proceed without a full environmental assessment of the safety, health and environmental risks.\\n\\nWith the state and federal governments failing to protect the public, local communities are a critical line of defense. Luckily, California communities have the power to use local zoning laws to protect themselves. That’s what we did in Dryden. And that’s what Los Angeles has done.\\n\\nOur town of 14,000 stands in proud solidarity with the people of Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. We may be small—but we’re not alone. The elected officials in our little town alone have received more than 30,000 letters of support from people all around the country and world, cheering us on for taking a stand.\\n\\nThe oil and gas industry often threatens to sue communities that take on fracking. In our case, they actually did. But we’ve beaten them at every turn, winning two rounds against them in New York state courts. This spring, our case will be heard by New York’s highest court. And, with the help of our pro-bono attorneys at Earthjustice, we’re confident that we’ll prevail.\\n\\nAnschutz Exploration Corporation, owned by billionaire Philip Anschutz (who also owns L.A.'s Staples Center), was the first company to sue us. After losing in the first court battle, Anshutz pulled out. Norse Energy stepped in and appealed the case; they have since gone bankrupt.\\n\\nLast week, I joined a delegation of people from fracking impacted and threatened communities to travel up and down the state of California, educating people about the dangers of fracking and more importantly: what people can do about it.\\n\\nThe nationwide tour, sponsored by Stop the Frack Attack—a 136-group coalition—is traveling to states where the oil and gas industry is poised to begin major activity using this dangerous and controversial technique.\\n\\nWe traveled to Sacramento, Merced and Los Angeles this month. We’ve learned that more and more communities have been stepping up. But there’s lots more work to be done. Get involved.\\n\\nAn earlier version of this blog appeared in the Huffington Post.\",\n",

(Photo: Special to the Press-Citizen)\\n\\nIowa City police officers are turning to an unusual source for their defensive tactics training: the Hawkeye wrestling team.\\n\\nOver 50 Iowa City officers, eight University of Iowa police officers and officers from the Oelwein Police Department participated in a three-day training last week, learning defensive tactics and takedowns from current and former star UI wrestlers.\\n\\nIowa City Police Chief Jody Matherly — himself a former high school wrestling coach — said the training is intended as a last resort for a situation that gets out of control quickly, once officers have tried de-escalation techniques and other methods to calm the person they\\'re interacting with.\\n\\n\"In this situation, we wanted them to plan for the unexpected,\" Matherly said. \"Be able to take that person to the ground safely so no one gets hurt and then to control them for a period of time until backup arrives. You have to buy yourself time.\"\\n\\nInstructors included Iowa All-American wrestlers Matt McDonough, Mike Evans and Thomas Gilman, and Iowa City officers Ian Alke and Niles Mercer, according to a Monday news release from the Iowa City Police Department. Iowa City Sgt. Doug Hart organized the training with Iowa wrestling coach Tom Brands.\\n\\nAlthough police learn defensive tactics at the police academy and train regularly with certified instructors, for a big wrestling fan like Matherly, the training was a great opportunity for officers to work with the \"legendary\" UI wrestling team. And, he said, the unusual nature of the training helped keep officers engaged.\\n\\nIowa City Police Chief Jody Matherly, left, watches with assistant wrestling coach Ryan Morningstar as University of Iowa wrestlers train law enforcement in defensive tactics and wrestling moves.

We tend to do things as usual, and part of this was to put a different spin on it and make it a little more exciting.\"\\n\\nIt also left them with a few bruises.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be honest, they didn\\'t come out unscathed. I had a couple say, \\'My neck’s a little tweaked,\\'\" Matherly said. \"And they found out that they have got to make sure they maintain their physical skills and stay in shape.\"\\n\\nUniversity of Iowa Public Safety Director Scott Beckner said he hopes the partnership between law enforcement and the wrestling team will expand in the future, and could include other area departments.\\n\\nAlthough both Matherly and Beckner are relatively new to the area, they have a long history of working together in previous roles. Additional collaborations between their two departments are being planned, they said.\\n\\n\"Next year as this grows, we plan to open up more avenues of training with each other, and it\\'s just going to blossom, I think, in the future,\" Beckner said.\\n\\nLaw enforcement from Iowa City, the University of Iowa and Oelwein watch as University of Iowa wrestlers demonstrate a move as part of a defensive tactics training.

The firefighters battled the blaze for more than two hours.\\n\\nDubai’s Civil Defence announced at about 3:30 a.m. that firefighters had brought the blaze under control and said cooling operations were underway.\\n\\nBy mid-day Friday, a few police cars could be seen in the area, but the streets had been wiped clean of falling debris from the fire, some of which had fallen on cars parked below.\\n\\nThe building remained closed to residents, some of whom were transferred to a nearby and even taller residential tower while others took refuge with friends.\\n\\nNo injuries have been reported so far in the Torch Tower fire incident — Dubai Media Office (@DXBMediaOffice) August 3, 2017\\n\\nThe more than 1,100-foot-tall (335 metres) tower, located in the popular waterfront Marina district, also caught fire in February 2015; there were also no casualties reported in that blaze. Parts of the building were still undergoing restoration work when the second fire broke out overnight Friday.\\n\\nIn both incidents, it appears fire alarms alerted residents and building staff knocked on doors to ensure a quick evacuation.\\n\\nAuthorities shared a photo of the charred and blackened tower after the fire was put out. Officials said they were now working on providing shelter for those affected.\\n\\nREAD MORE: Fire engulfs Dubai hotel ahead of NYE celebrations, minor injuries reported\\n\\nSeveral skyscrapers in the United Arab Emirates have caught fire in recent years, including a towering inferno that engulfed a 63-storey luxury hotel in Dubai on New Year’s Eve in 2016.

       " 'Russia has emerged as one of the winners from the trade dispute between Canada and the U.S over lumber.\\n\\nThe U.S. is importing more softwood lumber from overseas after it slapped tariffs on Canadian supplies, making them more expensive. Russian shipments are 42 per cent higher so far in 2017, according to U.S. government data.\\n\\nTo be sure, Russia accounts for a relatively small proportion of the total, while European countries such as Germany and Sweden are among the biggest suppliers to the U.S. But the shift in volumes illustrate how a political spat has quickly altered the flow of international trade.\\n\\nStory continues below advertisement\\n\\nOpinion: The U.S. argument in lumber talks is, yet again, based on faulty calculations\\n\\n\"It seems to be that there\\'s something illogical that we\\'re not buying the lumber from our neighbors to the north, that we\\'re buying it from the Russians,\" Jerry Howard, chief executive officer of the National Association of Home Builders, said in a telephone interview from Washington. \"That\\'s sort of the looking glass that we\\'ve gone through and that\\'s what the market is forcing us to do now.\"\\n\\nThe dispute has increased material costs for house builders in the U.S. by 20 per cent, according to Howard. Lumber futures traded in Chicago have gained 11 per cent this year, among the best performance of all the commodities tracked by Bloomberg. Prices fell 0.6 per cent to $364 per 1,000 board feet at 10:33 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\\n\\nThe trade in softwood lumber between the U.S. and Canada has been an intermittent source of friction for years, but tensions escalated in April when the Trump administration set countervailing duties of up to 24 per cent on Canadian imports. Additional duties of as much as 7.7 per cent followed in June.\\n\\nThere\\'s been speculation since then that both sides could resolve their differences before talks this month aimed at renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. But so far, it\\'s remained as speculation.\\n\\nMonthly softwood lumber shipments from Russia totaled 4,214 cubic meters in May, the most since January 2008, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show.\\n\\nFor the first half of the year, offshore softwood-lumber imports into the U.S. rose 38 per cent, while shipments from Canada declined 1 per cent, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Joshua Zaret.\\n\\nStory continues below advertisement\\n\\nStory continues below advertisement\\n\\nThe additional cost of Canadian lumber is not only saddling U.S. consumers with extra costs but threatens to price some of them out of the market, according to Howard. For every $1,000 price increase of a home, 150,000 people are priced out of the market, he said.\\n\\n\"Fewer houses are being built at the moderate price points, and they\\'re not being built because the cost of lumber puts them out of too much of the consumers\\' buying range,\" he said.',\n",
       " 'About six weeks ago, I decided I needed to really grok the Android platform, so I turned off my beloved iPad 2, wrapped it in a foam cover which I taped up, placed the bundle into a box which I also wrapped with several layers of duct tape, and put it in the back of the highest, out of reach shelf I could find (the one in the corner of the kitchen, where you need to have a ladder to get back there). This is what I had to do to force myself to use my Motorola Xoom, which I bought last year for testing and have barely touched since.\\n\\nSo, I spent the last month or so using Android exclusively. I also use a Samsung Galaxy Nexus as my phone, and both are updated to the latest and greatest version of Jelly Bean available as both devices are promoted by Google, which has some nice benefits in terms of sharing accounts, apps, etc. It\\'s nice not to experience any sort of real cognitive effort when switching from one to the other, as they\\'re both using the same OS. JellyBean is definitely miles ahead of the Android versions that came before it in terms of usability, design and responsiveness - I can definitely feel it on my Xoom, which despite it being a bit old now, feels faster than ever, and my Nexus just flies. Finally, it\\'s so nice to have control over my own device\\'s application install process, and know the platform in general is open - if I need to check out the source code, I can. There\\'s just a lot going for the Android platform.\\n\\nBut despite all this, and despite using Android for weeks without touching iOS at all, I was pretty happy the other day when I needed to test something and decided to pull my iPad out of it\\'s hiding place. First because it\\'s silly to own a $600 device and not use it, but second I could now use the iPad again with fresh eyes, and see what it is that makes it so much nicer to use than my Xoom. Is the hardware alone? Not really. The iPad 2 is thinner and faster, but the Xoom has nicer speakers and a higher resolution screen which makes videos nicer and a better selection of ports and is more comfortable to use while plugged in.\\n\\nSo it must be the OS obviously... Well, not really. In many ways, iOS is more refined, without a doubt, but its limitations always drive me nuts and multi-tasking still is less than optimal. As time has gone by Android has just kept adding great features like voice-typing and Google Now and better system customization and organization in general. The Settings in iOS have become a mess - there\\'s like 5 different places to enter usernames and passwords, let alone all the various apps. Android JellyBean is actually far more organized, letting me control syncing apps and accounts from a centralized spot easily - Google, Microsoft, Evernote, Skype, Dropbox, Firefox, Twitter, Facebook, etc. It\\'s nice to have all that stuff centralized.\\n\\nOk, then it\\'s the apps - iOS has way more and better apps than Android. Again, no... All the top-tier apps I want and need are all on Android now, so I haven\\'t noticed this at all. There\\'s not a single game or app that I was desperate for and really missed once I moved to Android. As nice as the App Store is, nothing there that\\'s essential (to me at least) hasn\\'t been ported already. And not only that, but the \"intents\" system means that I can choose which app I want to use as my default for all the basics - music, movies, email, web, calendar, etc. - which is fantastic and liberating and How It Should Work (tm).\\n\\nIt\\'s the BROWSER, stupid\\n\\nNo, there\\'s only one area where Android falls really, horribly, undeniably short when it comes to the tablet form factor: The web browser. It\\'s the most fundamental tablet app, IMHO, and yet the web experience on Android could not possibly be worse.\\n\\nI honestly have no idea how this is possible. Google has not one, but two Android tablet browsers, Firefox and Opera both have a pair of their own, various others like Dolphin and Skyfire have launched browsers as well, and yet... ALL OF THEM SUCK. Every single one of them. It\\'s unbelievable. Apple doesn\\'t allow any other choice of browser except for those using it\\'s core WebKit engine, and yet, somehow, it\\'s still a vastly better experience than using any of the top-tier browsers running natively on Android.\\n\\nNow - let me stop here for a second and say that I\\'m talking specifically about TABLET browsers. I\\'m not talking about the experience on the phone. In fact, I think that Chrome and Firefox for Android are both amazing browsers on my Samsung Nexus. Probably better than any mobile browser I\\'ve ever used - and I\\'ve used more of them, and for longer than pretty much anyone you know. But for some reason, the experience on the tablet is absolutely miserable. There\\'s a higher bar to hurdle when using a browser on a tablet, as there\\'s so much more time invested, so much more information and activity involved. Tablets have the potential to be just as good, or maybe even better at the web than the PC and thus need to rise to the occasion. A great browser on a phone can be (and in reality is) a poor browser on a tablet. The use cases and experiences are vastly different, and for some reason, only Apple seems to know how to do it correctly.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, my browser of choice on iOS isn\\'t even Safari - it\\'s iCab Mobile, which uses the embedded version of WebKit, and thus can\\'t take advantage of the speed improvements from the latest JavaScript engine. Even so, the core UIWebView is quite competent and the developer of iCab has built on this core by adding a host of useful browser features and options including various web modules, integrated search engines, ad-blocking, full customizable toolbar and dropdown UIs, bookmark syncing, full-screen mode and more. It\\'s without a doubt the best browser on iOS. If there can be such versatility and innovation on a closed system like iOS, developed by ONE PERSON, how in the world is it possible that the browser teams at Google, Mozilla and Opera or the third tier guys like Dolphin aren\\'t able to produce something even slightly as good? It\\'s incredible to me.\\n\\nOK, so let\\'s go over the specific reasons why each and every Android tablet browser is unusable in their own special way. We\\'ll start with what is actually the best browser for Android tablets, the default stock browser running a version of WebKit (if you don\\'t have a Nexus 7, that is, which uses Chrome by default instead).\\n\\nJellyBean Stock Browser\\n\\nThe stock browser is actually the fastest of the Android browsers. I could *feel* this was the case as a result of using them all, but I just looked it up and sure enough here\\'s the benchmarks. It\\'s actually about as fast as Safari on the iPad, from my own informal experience and the stats. This would be great, but ol\\' Stocky ain\\'t so good with the multi-threading... when a page is loading it\\'s pretty much useless until every single thing has been downloaded. If there\\'s a script or gif or something that\\'s taking it\\'s time, well, you aren\\'t going to be clicking on any links until it\\'s ready.\\n\\nAlso, the stock browser isn\\'t particularly smooth while scrolling - though this could be my venerable Xoom hardware\\'s fault, Firefox actually gets this right and scrolls as smooth as glass on the same exact hardware, so I think it\\'s a more fundamental problem. It doesn\\'t really matter, as this browser is going away soon, to be replaced by Chrome, but it\\'s important to remember how many millions of people are going to be using this browser as their default for the next several years.\\n\\nHere\\'s some screenshots of my top gripes.\\n\\n1. That fixed nav bar in the middle of TechCrunch\\'s page probably isn\\'t supposed to be floating around with the text, but it is.\\n\\n2. This is the dialog box that comes up when I click a YouTube link in Reddit. I\\'ve chose \"Always\" about 3,496 times thus far and it doesn\\'t seem to ever last for more than a day or so. Basically, any time any app updates it seems to reset your default choices.\\n\\n3. This is a blank page. It says \"Loading...\", but it\\'s not. It\\'s just blank... any time I have blank web page from a new tab or a cancelled tab or whatever, it just says \"Loading...\" as if it\\'s going to do something. Except, sometimes it actually is loading... but that\\'s rare.\\n\\n4. These are the thumbnails on my Bookmarks page. I have no idea why tablet browser makers are so enamored with thumbs - they NEVER WORK. See that Facebook bookmark? I have no idea who that baby is. It\\'s been there for a month or so now, but I don\\'t ever remember seeing the baby when it passed by my stream the first time, so she\\'s pretty much a mystery to me at this point. The other thumbnails are either blank, or contain such small text as to be useless. Believe it or not, this is one of the *better* bookmarking systems of the main browsers as it comes up quickly and is an overlay, so you can use bookmarklets.\\n\\n5. Lots of sites still get confused by the stock browser and display a mobile page instead of their default site. You can\\'t change your User-Agent, but you can choose \"Show Desktop Site\" in the menu. Of course it resets as soon as you close that tab, and there\\'s no way to make it permanent.\\n\\nChrome for Android\\n\\nOne would think that the latest and greatest browser that Google offers would actually be better than the one that came before it, right? Yeah, me too. I actually *want* to use Chrome on Android, as it\\'s my main browser on the desktop, and I like syncing stuff it does. But sadly, I can\\'t as Chrome for Android on the tablet is pretty much unusable. It rocks on my Nexus, so I can\\'t figure out how Google were possibly able to fuck up the experience so badly on the tablet, but they did. Not only is it marketedly slower than the stock browser, it also manages to have less customizability and break other features as well like the bookmarks.\\n\\nHere\\'s the screenshots:\\n\\n1. I\\'m not sure how Chrome manages to screw up the font on this page so badly, but it seems to be the only browser that does. This isn\\'t the only page like this, but basically the top fonts are a ton smaller than the bottom ones, for no reason. I\\'ve looked at the markup to check, and there doesn\\'t seem to be any actual reason for the change, it just happens.\\n\\n2. But you think, ok, at least the bigger text will be easier to click on, right? Ahh! You see, the Chrome team has helpfully added a magnifier \\'feature\\' to the browser which bubbles up a section of the page which contains the link you were clicking on. It doesn\\'t matter if you tapped the page accurately or not, it ALWAYS BUBBLES UP. In other words, you have to tap on EVERY LINK AT LEAST TWICE in order to activate it. And god help you if you mis-tap the bubble... because then it just disappears, and you\\'re not sure for a moment whether there\\'s just a bit of lag in the activation, or if you actually missed it.\\n\\n(I would like to remind the gentle reader that activating a link has been pretty much the most fundamental part of the web since it\\'s inception. Links are what put the \"hyper\" in hypertext. They are what gives us the H in HTML and HTTP... You click links to navigate, you click them to activate, you click them to read, you click them to close, etc. etc. To fuck up this basic functionality so badly takes an extra special level of incompetence that I hope you can appreciate. It is to sit back, and wonder.)\\n\\n3. All other issues with Chrome pale in comparison, but I\\'ll just go over them quickly... Chrome\\'s settings are sparse to the point of being useless. No add-ons, no plugins, no real options to speak of. Compared to it\\'s desktop counterpart, it is neutered in every way possible. I have to assume this will change in the future.\\n\\n4. Even though Chrome does support a bit more features than the stock browser, it\\'ll still get hung up. The images in this screenshot died for some reason, and Google pulled out the circa 1997 \\'dead image\\' icons for us to see. Wasn\\'t that nice? Also, this page took almost forever to render...\\n\\n5. And as I mentioned before, from the \"if it\\'s not broke, don\\'t fix it\" department, Chrome re-did the bookmarks. Happily, they got rid of those stupid frigin\\' thumbnails, but replaced the overlay bookmark dialog page with a custom bookmark web page which replaces the page you were just looking at (including the URL). This makes my save link bookmarklets - which I use daily - pretty useless. Also, where did those icons come from? Twitter\\'s is about 5 years old, Facebook and my Magnet I think come from the apple-touch-icon.png file, but Google and Evernote don\\'t seem to have anything (though they did, cutely, pull the dominant color from the favicon.ico to decorate the doc file border, isn\\'t that nice?).\\n\\nFirefox for Android\\n\\nA month or so ago I was applying to work at Mozilla so I started doing a deep-dive on all things Firefox. I didn\\'t get the job (same thing goes for when I applied at the GOOG), but by then I had already started well down the path of exploring Firefox for Android. In fact, in many ways, it was the reason I put the iPad away in the first place. There are some really great things about Firefox for Android, and there are lots and lots of insanely annoying and outright stupid things as well.\\n\\nFirst the good part: The functionality *inside* the borders of the user interface is fantastic. Firefox without a doubt renders pages better, more smoothly and more predictably than any of the other Android tablet browsers. I have to admit that I had written off the Gecko engine years ago once WebKit became the dominant engine for Apple and Google. It just seemed old and crusty and I doubted that it could ever be made to work efficiently enough for more resource-constrained platforms like phones or tablets. I was completely wrong about that - Gecko is obviously keeping the pace as the page rendering in my experience just *feels* really great (if that makes any sense).\\n\\nNow the bad part. OH MY GOD! WHAT THE HELL ARE THE UI PEOPLE AT MOZILLA THINKING?!?! I have been complaining about Fennec and now Firefox mobile for literally *YEARS*. But when they finally get rid of the completely moronic hidden sidepanel interfaces that you used (or more likely, accidentally activated) by swiping from the side, they replaced it with an interface that, if anything, is even *more* brain damaged. It\\'s incredible. Year after year they continue to hose the GUI, it\\'s amazing. Seriously, it\\'s hard for me not to have an embolism just thinking about it now.\\n\\nAnd worse? It\\'s not fixable by anyone outside the core team of developers as they\\'ve moved away from the standard XUL UI system to a pure Java wrapper. I was going to get in there and whip up some add-ons because I really wanted to use the browser and thought if I could just tweak a few of it\\'s more ugly bits it\\'d be somewhat usable. But after downloading the code and taking a good long look, it turns out that all the bits that suck the most are outside anything modifiable by add-ons. Want to auto-hide the tabs with an add-on? You can\\'t. Want to add a custom tab layer across the top? You can\\'t. Want to read or manage your list of bookmarks? You can\\'t. The native gecko engine is contained within a new UI written completely in Java and - except for a tiny subset of functionality specifically made available via some crazy JSON passing interface that I truly *hope* has some sort of legitimate reason for being - you can\\'t modify the UI with add-ons. Joy.\\n\\nI was only able to develop one of my original list of tiny tweaks that I wanted to create as add-ons (auto-closing tabs, organizing bookmarks, adding an existing bookmarklet to the menu, shrinking the size of the side tab bar). I was able to add a Search menu item to the selected text dialog box (I had to write it twice, as the functionality I was tweaking had changed between Beta and Nightly and I wrote it for nightly). I submitted it to the Firefox Add-Ons site - you can download it here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/search-selected/.\\n\\nBut it\\'s not just the customizability of Firefox for Android that\\'s the problem. There are core issues that are in desperate need of fixing. Let\\'s take a look at the screenshots, and go over each one...\\n\\n1. There\\'s a lot here to look at. First is simply the layout of the screen itself. Hard-coded in the Java portion of the UI is a test to see whether you\\'re using a tablet or not, and if you are, permanently puts the tabs on the left. In portrait mode, as you can see, putting the tab thumbnails (again with the thumbnails... why?!?!) on the side takes up an entire QUARTER of the screen. And, like Fennec from days gone by, rather than being an overlay, or shoving the browser screen to the right beyond the side window, the tab bar comes out and the browser page is reflowed into the area shrunk to fit the 3/4\\'s width left over. Most Android tablets so far have a 16x9 format screen, which means that the width of the page is now just 600px across and as you can see, makes the page generally unreadable.\\n\\nNote that the side tab panel is stuck open or closed - there\\'s no auto-close feature that\\'s exposed to the add-ons, so you either have to suffer with reading your page in 3/4 screen width, or constantly be opening and closing the tab bar manually (re-flowing the page *every single time*). That is if you want to read the screen in portrait mode. Though I prefer portrait reading and would like to think most people are like myself, I\\'ll say for sake of argument that 50% of the people won\\'t mind the tab bar because they read the web in landscape mode. That simply means that Firefox is useless to half the people who want to use it. I can\\'t imagine that\\'s on a slide deck anywhere within Mozilla\\'s headquarters, do you? \"50% will think our browser is great. The other 50%? Will hate it.\" Great job!\\n\\nBut let\\'s take a step back for a second... WHY are the tabs displayed as thumbnails anyways? Why do they take up so much room? Exactly ZERO of the most popular desktop browsers use thumbnails in their tabs, why in the WORLD do browser makers think that resource constrained devices like phones and tablets want them? They make *no sense*. And what the hell is that giant number doing in the toolbar? Do the designers at Mozilla really think it\\'s a great user interface to have the number of open tabs in such a prominent spot? \"Hey, look at that I have *1* browser tab open. Now I have *2* tabs! Yay! Wait, ready... now I have *3* tabs!! Good thing it\\'s at the TOP OF THE BROWSER in a GIANT FONT so I don\\'t forget! Did anyone actually test this on sane people? \"Hey, what do you think of the gargantuan tab counter there, pretty good hey?\" Maybe if the tab bar design wasn\\'t so badly implemented, the count of tabs wouldn\\'t be needed...\\n\\nWow, that was all in the first screenshot... next.\\n\\n2. Despite having to having a comically over-sized \"awesome\" bar at the top of the screen, for some reason the Firefox UI devs couldn\\'t work out how to fit both the title and the URL into that space. This is VERY VERY VERY BAD. See this screenshot of CNBC? It\\'s not CNBC - it\\'s an actual link I got just this week in my email via a friend who\\'s account somehow got a virus or hacked or something. It looks like CNBC, but it\\'s actually some scam site. If you could see the URL, you would know this. There is no reason to *ever* hide the URL. Even Apple who are constantly paring down their UIs to the most simple, non-techy version possible, has kept the URL address bar in all their browsers. It\\'s a *fundamental* part of a web browser and you can\\'t hide it. EVER. Seriously, this is the dumbest thing I can possibly imagine a major browser vendor doing.\\n\\n3. If the above wasn\\'t bad enough, the bookmark situation is ridiculous. It takes at least two clicks to get to the bookmarks - via a new tab, if the tab bar is already open, otherwise you have to open it, or by clicking on the address bar, then clicking the bookmarks tab. The bookmarks are totally non-adjustable. They might be synced (as mine are) to Firefox on the Desktop, but whatever order they appear in is completely out of your control. And despite the \"Desktop Bookmarks\" folder at the top, there doesn\\'t seem to be any use of folders beyond that, making all of your favorites complete chaos.\\n\\n4. Are you done with this tab? Want to close it? You can\\'t. It\\'s the last one. You have to open up a new tab before you can close the old one. Why not just reuse the page? I don\\'t know. Why not just let me close the damn thing? Maybe I\\'m in a hurry to make sure an onlooker doesn\\'t see me checking out the Deviant Marmalade Goat Porn Review site I was just browsing. Maybe I\\'m just lazy and can\\'t remember where the hell the bookmarks are. Who knows? Maybe because every other time I\\'m done browsing a tab, I close it with the X button and it creates a cognitive issue every time I hit the end of my tabs and am confused why I can\\'t continue to close tabs... Just fucking fix it.\\n\\nOpera for Android\\n\\nOpera\\'s pretty much a lost cause, sorry to say, so I won\\'t focus too much on them. Pages load slowly and have lots of issues, there\\'s no way to set the font size beyond just a \"zoom\" option, there\\'s not many options and zero add-ons or plugins and the whole GUI is basically just a sized-up version of their mobile browser rather than one made for a tablet. It\\'s just not ready for prime time at all.\\n\\n1) First screenshot you\\'ll see that clicking on a link while zoomed out, highlighted the link (rather than activating it) and zoomed me in. So apparently I need to re-click that link to make it work. Almost as bad as Chrome\\'s bubbles.\\n\\n2) The font size is defaulted to \"make my eyes bleed tiny\". It is nice that they give you the option to always wrap the text, so as you zoom in, the page doesn\\'t go off to the right, but is instead reflowed at the closer zoom. But in general it\\'s a pain.\\n\\n3) Despite having the User Agent set as Desktop, sites like the New York Times still see the Opera browser as mobile. Opera isn\\'t setting the User Agent to be EXACTLY like their desktop version or there\\'s some other headers slipping through (like one marking the client as using Android) which is causing sites to treat the browser as mobile.\\n\\n4) Like the iPhone did for a few years, fixed navigational elements cause the browser real issues, and you end up with crap floating all over your page as you scroll before it snaps back into place.\\n\\n5) The Opera guys apparently don\\'t even test their mobile browser on their own websites... The background from the blog that ANNOUNCED THE NEWEST VERSION is all hosed, flopping up and down as you scroll. How do they not fix this sort of thing first - I mean, it\\'s their OWN SITE. Either fix the site to make it at least seem okay, or preferably fix the browser.\\n\\n6) Tabs as thumbnails again, there\\'s a blank page, which actually wasn\\'t blank, and then this one from Github is just refreshing forever... Apparently either https:// or the javascript-rendered page hoses the thumbnail process. At least the thumbs are at the top of the page. Also, you\\'ll notice that, opposite of Mozilla, Opera has decided to only include the URL of the page, not the title. I prefer this to the reverse, definitely, but still... not the best solution. Every other browser vender is able to include both, figure it out.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nSo despite the fact that Android is a decent OS for the tablet, and that the world\\'s top browser makers outside of Microsoft and Apple are building browsers for the platform, the experience is somehow a miserable mess. It shouldn\\'t be a surprise to anyone that 92% of the web traffic from tablets comes from iPads... It\\'s just a painful experience. If Google wants to have Android tablets seriously compete against the iPad (and the upcoming iPad mini), they\\'ve got to get their act together and produce a decent TABLET browser. My only thought is that maybe the people at Google developing the browser simply don\\'t *USE* Android tablets regularly. If they did, on a daily basis it wouldn\\'t be like this. Maybe now that Nexus has launched, and other bigger tablets are close behind that Google has more control over, they\\'ll give it the time and effort needed. They better.\\n\\nAnd if Mozilla wants to get any traction on Android and other mobile devices, they\\'ve got to get control of the team that\\'s making the sort of disastrous design decisions that went into making Firefox for Android, and get them back on track to creating a professional, use-it-every-day-all-day browser for tablet devices. Because honestly, now that I\\'ve seen what\\'s going on under the covers of Firefox for Android, I have nothing but serious skepticism about their ability to create a mobile OS UI that isn\\'t going to suck equally as badly. I already see some of the same insane designs being re-used and it doesn\\'t bode well. Giant tab counters, cutesy thumbnails and sliding tab bars may all seem beautiful on a PowerPoint slide or in a quick video demo, but regular people aren\\'t going to put up with that crap day to day. And when the first large-scale scam hits the Firefox OS users getting them to enter private details into a fake bank site or something because the URL was hidden, make sure you remember where you heard about it first.\\n\\nHonestly, this is pretty important.\\n\\nI don\\'t generally dislike Apple, but I do think it\\'s unhealthy for them to have such a massive lock on the tablet market. Tablets are the most important device to come along in a generation - even more important than the smartphone IMHO. Tablets are our personal information, entertainment, education and communication device which every school kid through to every retiree on the planet will have in their bag sooner than later. And the web browser is the most important part of that device - it\\'s a portable window into the rest of the world, accessible by simply touching a screen. The browser has to work and work well, and not be dominated by a single company or platform. The fact that browsers suck so badly on Android tablets means that the benefits of competition - lower prices, wider availability - are being lost as people buy these devices and eventually abandon them as not worth the effort.\\n\\nBut if the browser doesn\\'t suck, then no matter what, the tablet is useful. There are Android tablets being sold in places like Toys R Us now for less than $100 and the reality is that many of the children getting one of these cheap-ass devices just don\\'t have regular access to a mobile phone or a PC or maybe even a library or a decent school. If, at the bare minimum, they can get a decent web browser on it? Then it won\\'t matter how customized, or cheap or commercial the rest of the system is - they\\'ll be able to have access to the entire world. So it\\'s not just about Android beating Apple, or dominating the tablet market and all that other stuff, it\\'s simply about the providing the core web functionality now, so that it starts to permeate out to the rest of the world as soon as possible. Already there\\'s been millions of Android tablets sold, and each one that has a less-than-optimal web browser is a missed opportunity.\\n\\n-Russ',\n",
       " \"Remember when one month ago the US, to much pomp and circumstance, not to mention one downgrade, announced a grand bargain raising the debt ceiling from $14.294 trillion to something much higher, with a stop gap intermediate ceiling of $14.694 trillion, or $400 billion more. Well, as of today, or less than a month since the expansion, total US debt is at $14.697 trillion. Yep - the total debt is again over the ceiling, which means the US debt increased by $400 billion in one month. Score one for fiscal prudence. And while the total debt subject to the limit is still slightly less, at $14.652, one week of Treasury auctions and will be time for Moody's to justify again why the US is a quadruple A credit.\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n\\nBOSTON (CBS) — Everyone in America has personal opinions as to what happened (or didn’t happen) in the bowels of Gillette Stadium on the night of Jan. 18. Some people believe that Tom Brady ordered some equipment guys to stick a needle in the footballs to take out some air. Some people believe not only that Brady did no such thing, but that no air was ever taken out of any balls. And still many more believe something that falls somewhere in between those two extremes.\\n\\nBut one thing that most reasonable people can agree on is this: The NFL went overboard in its punishment of Brady and the Patriots.\\n\\nA $1 million fine, the forfeiture of a first-round and fourth-round draft pick, as well as a four-game suspension for the quarterback who was never actually proven to be guilty was an objectively excessive penalty, especially considering most every comparable violation in NFL history has resulted only in a small fine and a stern warning. (See: The Carolina Panthers in Minnesota last year.)\\n\\nWell, as it turns out, such a statement no longer requires the suspension of one’s disbelief. That’s because, for one reason or another, a Los Angeles Times story from 2007 bubbled to the surface of Twitter on Thursday afternoon, and the story shows exactly how the NFL handled a situation nearly identical to “DeflateGate” eight years ago.\\n\\nTo ensure the footballs aren’t switched during the game, the officials mark each of them using a rubber stamp. … Yet, with all the care, teams still occasionally try to switch out a ball. It happened once to [Tony] Corrente’s crew and back judge [Don] Carey confiscated the ball, turned it over to league security, they sent it to headquarters, and the team was punished.\\n\\nTo recap: A team was caught red-handed putting an unapproved, and therefore uninspected, football into a game. That team was punished, but certainly no first-round draft pick was taken away, and no quarterback was suspended for a quarter of a season.\\n\\nThere was no multi-million dollar, “independent” investigation. There was no eight-month firestorm in the national sports and news media. There was no instance of the commissioner doling out punishment, declaring himself to oversee the appeal hearing, and then ultimately ruling that he was right all along. There were no 10-hour appeal sessions and there were no battles in federal court.\\n\\nThere was, simply, a punishment, issued behind closed doors, likely with an attached warning that the offending team would be watched closer in the future, and that was that.\\n\\nIt was, dare I say … competent.\\n\\nThe LA Times story, published in September 2007, references the incident as something that took place in the past. Considering Goodell took his job prior to the 2006 season, it’s more probable than not that the incident took place during Paul Tagliabue’s tenure. Hence, the competence.\\n\\nThe example stands, obviously, in stark contrast to just about everything that took place at Gillette Stadium in January. That night, no fewer than five important employees of the NFL knew ahead of time to be on the lookout for someone messing with footballs — senior VP of football operations David Gardi, director of game ops James Daniel, VP of officiating Dean Blandino, senior director of officiating Alberto Riveron, referee Walt Anderson.\\n\\nDespite the forewarnings from the suspicious Colts, NFL officials nevertheless lost track of the footballs before the game. That’s when, according to the “independent” work of Ted Wells, Jim McNally tiptoed into a bathroom and let the air out of those footballs. Anderson was, according to Wells, losing his mind in an effort to find the footballs. (That’s even though McNally was only in the bathroom for 100 seconds, which isn’t much time for a referee to notice a missing bag and lose his mind immediately, unless that person has a very short fuse. But that’s a story for another day.)\\n\\nAnderson claimed that in his long NFL career, the footballs have never once gone missing from the officials’ locker room, so you’d think the combination of the pregame warnings and the missing footballs would prompt him to put the 12 backup footballs into action (those footballs remained in the officials’ locker room the entire time). But no, Anderson found the footballs on the field and allowed them to be put into play for the AFC Championship Game.\\n\\nAnd, of course, it was during that game when, as the story goes, Colts GM Ryan Grigson alerted Blandino and Troy Vincent, and the wheels of the NFL’s Integrity Machine began to churn at once.\\n\\nYou know what happened next. Somebody leaked news of the situation to Bob Kravitz, and the cat was out of the bag. “DeflateGate” was born, and now, nearly 11 months later, it still lives.\\n\\nSo why were things so different back in 2007? It’s a question worth asking.\\n\\nSome people will say, immediately, that it is evidence that “DeflateGate” as we know it was a sting operation from the get-go, intended to attack the Patriots and tear them down in some way. And given how much of the melodrama has played out this year, those people may be right.\\n\\nOn the flip side, there is the possibility that the team which got busted for the football malfeasance by Tony Corrente’s crew was … none other than the New England Patriots. If that were the case, and the Patriots had years ago been caught and warned to stop this practice, then it would certainly add a fresh angle as to why Goodell and the NFL might have gone about things the way they did this year. After all, the lingering belief from “Spygate” is that the Patriots weren’t punished so much for the actual offense of filming coaches from the wrong locations but for obstinately disobeying memos from the league.\\n\\nSome minor digging into that theory: In 2004, the Patriots were caught using their own footballs in a game. This was before teams supplied their own footballs. The Wells report noted that the Patriots explained it as “an honest mistake.” A.J. Feeley said he saw the Patriots use their own footballs in a Dolphins-Patriots game in 2004.\\n\\nBut the trail runs cold there, as Corrente’s officiating crew did not work either meeting between the Patriots and Dolphins that year. So that’s a dead end.\\n\\nPro-football-reference.com lists the game logs of all NFL officials, and according to those records, Carey did work four Patriots games with Corrente (Steelers-Patriots and Jets-Patriots in 2002; Patriots-Cardinals in 2004; Raiders-Patriots in 2005). So it is possible, if not statistically likely, that the incident spotlighted in the LA Times article involved the Patriots.\\n\\nThat, really, might be the only reasonable explanation for Goodell’s treatment of the alleged minor offense this year. (The idea that he treated them harshly because he “went easy on them with Spygate” is an odd theory, considering the Spygate penalties were unprecedented.)\\n\\nBut let’s say the case described in that 2007 article did not involve the Patriots, because really, don’t you think Mr. Wells or Goodell might have mentioned that once or twice over the past 10-plus months? If it involved any of the other 31 NFL teams and was simply treated for what it was (an equipment violation, rather than a grave threat to the “integrity of the game“), then the contrast in situations shows that the NFL unquestionably went too far with its punishment of the Patriots.\\n\\nAs with most questions we have for the NFL, it’s unlikely that we’ll ever know the truth.\\n\\nRead more from Michael Hurley by clicking here.

       " 'Conclusion: SC GM atrophy is already detectable at an early stage of MS, in absence of detectable WM atrophy, and affects both the cervical and thoracic cord.\\n\\nResults: In cervical and thoracic SC, patients had significantly smaller GM areas than controls (C2/C3: p=0.005; T9/T10: p=0.041), but had no significant difference in either the SC white matter (WM) or total cord areas. Cervical and thoracic GM areas were not correlated with the number of SC T2-lesions. In the subgroup of patients without prior SC relapses (N=32), a multivariable model based on cervical SC GM area as the predictor variable with age and sex as covariates explained 48% of EDSS variance. While in the patients with prior SC relapses there was no significant association between SC GM area and EDSS, the number of SC T2-lesions did predict 26% of EDSS variance in this subgroup in a linear model (with age and sex as covariates).\\n\\nMethods: As part of an observational cohort study, one hundred seventeen subjects were scanned with axial 2D-phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) MRI at 3T: Sixty-four patients at an early stage of MS (mean disease duration from first symptom onset 1.2 years (0–4 years), mean age 36.9 years, median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score 2.0, 44 women) and fifty-three healthy controls (mean age 37.4 years, 38 women). PSIR images were acquired at the intervertebral disc levels C2/C3 and T9/10. EDSS scores were determined in patients.\\n\\nObjectives: To estimate SC GM area’s potential as a biomarker of disease progression, it is important to understand how early in the MS course SC GM atrophy can be detected, which parts of the cord are affected, and the relationship to SC relapses and T2-lesions.\\n\\nBackground: Spinal cord (SC) gray matter (GM) atrophy was recently described in vivo in patients with long-standing multiple sclerosis (MS) and was shown to correlate with disability and disease type.\\n\\nConclusion: A combination of MRI and OCT metrics strongly describe visual dysfunction. These preliminary results may improve the understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying clinical dysfunction in multiple sclerosis.\\n\\nResults: We performed a partial least square regression analysis to model LCLA and VEP based on a combination of demographics, MRI (MD, myelin, ODI) and OCT metrics (GCL, pRNFL) considering negative/positive history of optic neuritis. We identified model predictor of LCLA with R-squared up to 0.39 and 0.36 for optic neuritis negative and positive respectively. We determined model predictor of VEP with R-squared up to 0.48 (ON negative) and 0.63 (ON positive).\\n\\nMethods: Fifty patients enrolled in a clinical trial were studied (age 40.1±10 years, EDSS 2.1±1, and disease duration 5.1±5 years) looking at baseline values and assessments (prior to treatment). Twenty-six patients had a previous history of optic neuritis. MRI: The thalamus, cerebellar cortex and primary visual area were parcellated from MPRAGE volumes as volumes of interest (VOIs) using Freesurfer. Maps of mean diffusivity (MD), orientation dispersion index (ODI) and “myelin water” content were computed. Mean values per each MRI metric were calculated within each VOI averaging left and right hemisphere. Number of occipital cortical lesions and total white matter lesion burden in the optic radiation were detected/segmented by an expert neuroradiologist. OCT: Spectral-Domain OCT (Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering). We evaluated peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness and macular volume with automated segmentation of retinal layers for the quantification of Ganglion Cell Layer (GCL) thickness.\\n\\nObjectives: To investigate the relative contribution of different MRI and OCT metrics to visual performance measured by low contrast letter acuity (LCLA) and visual evoked potentials (VEP), in MS patients.\\n\\nBackground: Tissue injury underlies neurological dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the relationship between structural abnormalities and functional impairment is unknown. The visual pathway (AVP) has shown promise as a highly informative isolated functional system useful for studying the pathological processes that underlie permanent neurological dysfunction in multiple sclerosis. Functional impairment – including both psychophysical dysfunction and electrophysiological response - as well as structural injury along the entire pathway can be quantitatively assayed in the visual system.\\n\\n1 University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 2 University of Genova, Genova, Italy, 3 University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy, 4 Imaging Genetics Center, Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 5 Basel University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, 6 University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA\\n\\nConclusion: This study identifies specific human gut bacteria that regulate adaptive autoimmune responses, suggesting therapeutic targeting of the microbiota as a novel treatment for MS.\\n\\nFinally, microbiota transplants from MS patients into germ-free mice results in more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and reduced Tregs compared to controls.\\n\\nWe next conducted in-vitro assays to characterize the functional properties of the MS gut microbiota. We found that MS-associated Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was sufficient to reduce Treg differentiation and increase both Th1 and Th2 differentiation. The expansion of Th1 lymphocytes was recapitulated by Akkermansia muciniphila , which was also more abundant in MS patients. In contrast, Parabacteroides distasonis , which was significantly reduced in MS microbiomes, stimulated CD4+ T lymphocyte differentiation into a CD25+ IL-10+ regulatory phenotype. Our results suggest that MS-associated changes in microbiota alter T lymphocyte differentiation in a complex fashion and likely through multiple mechanisms.\\n\\nResults: We found that MS patients exhibited impaired in-vitro Treg differentiation in response to their own microbiota. No major shifts in microbial community structure were observed. However, we were able to identify individual microbial taxa that were significantly associated with MS and studied their ability to regulate primary human T lymphocyte differentiation in vitro .\\n\\nMethods: We analyzed the microbiome of stool samples from 64 treatment-naïve MS patients and 68 healthy controls using amplicon sequencing of the 16S V4 region of the rRNA gene. We characterized immune profiles of cultured PBMC in response to specific bacteria harbored by MS patients.\\n\\nBackground: An essential function of the gut microbiota is to regulate immune responses, including T lymphocyte functions in health and disease.\\n\\n1 University of California, San Francisco, CA, 2 University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 3 Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands, 4 TBD, Pasadena, CA, 5 Cal Tech, Pasadena, CA, 6 University of California, La Jolla, CA, 7 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 8 Mount Sinai, New York, NY\\n\\nV.

Positron emission tomography (PET) can detect microglial activation through labelling of the ‘18kiloDalton translocator protein’ (TSPO). C-11-based TSPO PET radioligands are available but their short half life (20 minutes) precludes their widespread use. [F-18]PBR06 is a novel TSPO ligand that has a longer half-life (110 minutes), and a high signal to noise ratio, but has not been studied in MS.\\n\\nObjectives: The goals of this pilot study were 1) to compare [F-18]PBR06-derived microglial activation in MS vs. healthy controls (HC), and 2) To assess the relationship between such microglial activation and clinical and MRI findings in MS.\\n\\nMethods: Genotyping for rs6971 polymorphism in the TSPO gene was performed in all subjects and low affinity binders were excluded. 5 MS subjects (3 women, age 31.1±5.4 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale 2.0±1.2, Timed 25 foot walk 4.4±1.0 seconds) and 5 age- and TSPO genotype-matched HCs (3 women, age 37.8±14.9 years) underwent [F-18]PBR06 PET and 3T brain MRI. Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) maps were created for the 60-90 minute frame and were co-registered to MRI. PET images were segmented into brain regions by the AAL template. Normalized brain parenchymal volumes (SIENAX) and T2 hyperintense lesion volume were assessed.\\n\\nResults: [F-18]PBR06 SUV was significantly higher in MS vs. HC in the precentral gyrus (mean +12.8% ), inferior frontal and rolandic operculum (+18.7% and +19.8%), posterior cingulum (+21.4%), inferior parietal cortex (+10.9%), temporal pole (+25.6%), hippocampus (+17.5%), thalamus (+15.1%) and caudate (+15.7%) (all p<0.05). Among these regions, significant correlations of [F-18]PBR06 uptake were noted inversely with brain volume in the thalamus (r= -0.78, p<0.05) and positively with disease duration in the posterior cingulum (r=0.82, p<0.05) and thalamus (r= 0.82, p<0.05).\\n\\nConclusion: [F-18]PBR06 demonstrated cortical and subcortical grey matter abnormal microglial activation in MS. Such microglial activation may have a role in the development of brain atrophy. Further studies are warranted to assess the utility of [F-18]PBR06 in MS given its longer half-life and potential for widespread use.\\n\\nLB186\\n\\nCerebral Trans-Capillary Water Exchange Rate Constant is Reduced in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis\\n\\nDr. Rebecca I Spain, MD, MSPH1, Mr. Ian Tagge1, Dr. Manoj Sammi1, Dr. Shannon R Seals 2, Dr. Dennis Bourdette, MD1, Mr. Randy West1, Mr. John Grinstead1, Ms. Katherine Powers, BA1, Dr. Xin Li1, Dr. Charles Springer1 and Dr. William Rooney, PhD1\\n\\n1Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, 2Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR\\n\\nCategory: Imaging\\n\\nBackground: Pathophysiology of progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) includes chronic inflammation causing oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury, ultimately accelerating neuronal death. Metabolic deficits, driven by mitochondrial abnormalities, may be important determinants of brain atrophy in PMS. Water exchange across the endothelium of cerebral capillaries is tightly coupled to local metabolic demands and can be mapped by MRI. Trans-capillary water exchange could provide early insight into metabolic deficits in PMS and act as a biomarker of disease progression.\\n\\nObjectives: To compare cerebral trans-capillary water exchange in PMS to healthy controls (HC) using Shutter-Speed Paradigm (SSP) analysis of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) acquisitions. Outcomes of interest are k po (inverse of mean capillary water molecule lifetime), R 1exv (intrinsic extravascular H 2 O longitudinal relaxation rate constant), and v b (blood volume fraction).\\n\\nMethods: As part of a larger prospective cohort study, DCE-MRI with SSP was used to investigate outcomes of interest between PMS and HC. A single axial slice (10mm thick) inversion recovery (IR) turboflash sequence was positioned in the centrum semiovale. IR image sets (2.3 s temporal resolution, 50 sets total) were obtained before, during, and after intravenous injection of 14 μmol/kg Gadoteridol. R 1 maps were calculated for each IR image set. Parametric maps were created by voxel-by-voxel SSP modeling of the DCE-MRI data. Tissue segmentation was achieved via bimodal Gaussian fitting of R 1exv histograms. This preliminary cross-sectional analysis used unpaired t-tests to test for significant differences between cohorts in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal appearing gray matter (NAGM).\\n\\nResults: 16 PMS (5 PPMS, 63% female, 56.5 +/- 8.8 years old, duration since symptom onset 16.2 +/- 9.4 years) and 14 HC (50% female, 49.9 +/- 11.8 years old) were included in this analysis. R 1exv and k po were significantly lower in NAWM and NAGM in PMS compared to HC (p < 0.05). V b was only significantly increased in NAWM (p < 0.0005).\\n\\nConclusion: The trans-capillary water exchange rate constant, k po , is lower in PMS and may reflect cerebral metabolic dysfunction. The longitudinal study will determine if this dynamic measure is a sensitive biomarker for disease progression in PMS.\\n\\nLB187\\n\\nPhase II Double Blind Trial to Investigate the Efficacy and the Optimal Way of Administration in Active and Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\\n\\nDr. Panayiota Petrou , Dr. Ibrahim Kassis, Md, PhD, Dr. Neta Levin, Mrs. Michelle Hallimi, Prof. Tamir Ben Hur, MD, PhD, Dr. Ariel Ginzberg and Prof. Dimitrios Karussis, MD, PhD, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel\\n\\nCategory: Clinical Outcome Measures\\n\\nBackground: MSCs have been shown to possess neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. Two prior pilot studies in our center showed that a single intrathecal(IT), or IV administration of MSCs was safe and well tolerated, and provided indications of clinical efficacy in MS and ALS.\\n\\nObjectives: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of transplantation of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), in MS.\\n\\nMethods: The current study involves a double-blind crossover design that will enroll upon completion 48 progressive MS-patients. The study started in February-2015 and till the day of this abstract, 40 patients have already been included. During the 2-month run-in period, functional evaluations (EDSS, MSFC, neurocognitive evaluation, quantitative/functional MRI, OCT, dynamic visual and neurophysiological tests) were performed monthly before the transplantation. Bone marrow-derived MSC (1x106/Kg) or placebo were injected to the patients, IT or IV. At 6-months the patients are treated with a second injection of MSC/placebo and are followed for safety and all the efficacy measures for 12 months. The study was approved by the Ethics committee and MOH and is monitored by an external CRO and a safety committee\\n\\nResults: No serious treatment-related adverse events have been observed this far. Until today 38 patients received the first transplantation, 27 also the second treatment and 17 patients completed the study.\\n\\nConclusion: IT and IM administration of autologous MSCs seems till now to be well-tolerated. Our trial, uniquely, uses the intrathecal way of administration and for the first time a rigorous double blind design utilizing extensive surrogate markers to detect possible clinical effects of regeneration. In addition, this study is the first to try to evaluate the optimal way of administration of stem cells in MS and to evaluate the possible additional benefit of a repeated injection. Detailed and updated safety data will be provided upon presentation (NCT02166021).\\n\\nLB188\\n\\nToe-Off Angle During Walking is Related to Perceived Fatigue Ratings in Women With Multiple Sclerosis\\n\\nDr. Bryan D Loy, PhD 1, Dr. Brett W Fling, PhD2, Dr. Rebecca I Spain, MD, MSPH1 and Dr. Fay B Horak, PhD1\\n\\n1Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, 2Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO\\n\\nCategory: Clinical Outcome Measures\\n\\nBackground: Fatigue and difficulty walking are two common symptoms among people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Reported relationships between perceived fatigue and gait metrics used to quantify walking difficulty have been inconsistent, potentially due to fluctuations of MS symptoms and studies have not measured “right now” fatigue.\\n\\nObjectives: To determine the relationships between “past 2 weeks” and “right now” fatigue ratings and gait metrics obtained during a 2-minute walk.\\n\\nMethods: As part of an ongoing larger cross-sectional study examining MS fatigue and mobility biomarkers, 5 women with MS (4 relapsing-remitting, 1 secondary-progressive); Expanded Disability Status Scale < 5.5; aged 44.4 (± 10.3) years, completed the i) Profile of Mood States (POMS) fatigue subscale, and the ii) state energy and fatigue (SEF) mental and physical fatigue visual analog scales. The POMS assesses fatigue over “the past 2 weeks, including today” while the SEF asks participants to quantify fatigue “right now at this moment”. Participants also completed an instrumented 2-minute walk “as fast as possible” while wearing inertial sensors (APDM Opals; APDM, Inc. Portland, OR) on the feet, wrists, sternum, and lumbar back to obtain gait metrics. Pearson’s r was used to determine the strength of relationships between variables of interest.\\n\\nResults: “Past 2 weeks” fatigue was above population norms in 80% of the sample. “Right now” physical fatigue was strongly and significantly inversely correlated with both the left (r = -.923, p = .025) and right (r = -.921, p = .026) toe-off angle, although mental fatigue was not (left foot, r = .258, p = .675; right foot, r = .156, p = .802). “Past 2 weeks” fatigue was also correlated with both left (r = -.879, p = .050) and right (r = -.905, p = .035) toe-off angle. Other gait metrics (e.g., cadence, stride length, % time in double support) were not significantly correlated with any perceived fatigue measure. Data collection is on going with an expected N of 20 analyzed for the presentation at ACTRIMS.\\n\\nConclusion: Preliminary analyses revealed an inverse association between “past” and “right-now” fatigue and a small toe-off angle in women with MS. Failure to adequately lift the heel prior to toe-off may be a contributor to inadequate foot clearance during the swing phase of gait and may also provide an important outcome measure to monitor interventions aimed at reducing fatigue in women with MS.\\n\\nLB189\\n\\nClinical Efficacy of Plasma-Exchange in Patients with Progressive Forms of Multiple Sclerosis and NMO-Spectrum Disease\\n\\nDr. Panayiota Petrou , Prof. Tamir Ben Hur, MD, PhD, Dr. Adi Vaknin, MD, PhD, Prof. Oded Abramsky, MD, PhD and Prof. Dimitrios Karussis, MD, PhD, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel\\n\\nCategory: Clinical Outcome Measures\\n\\nBackground: Plasma-exchange/plasmapheresis (PLEX) is an ef cient treatment for several immune mediated diseases. In addition to its known efficacy in myasthenia gravis and Gulliain Barre syndrome, it has been also shown to be effective in certain patients with MS and other CNS demyelinating disorders, during an acute/sub-acute deterioration of the disease.\\n\\nObjectives: We report the results of an open prospective study with PLEX in 36 patients with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (either secondary progressive or relapsing-progressive) and 12 patients with NMO-spectrum disease\\n\\nMethods: All patients had experienced a significant clinical deterioration in the year prior to inclusion (0.5-1 degree or more, in the EDSS scale or a severe relapse from which they did not fully recover) and responded partially or not at all to steroidal treatment. The mean EDSS score at inclusion was 5.91 ± 1.46. The mean EDSS for the MS subgroup was 5.95 ± 1.3 and for the NMO subgroup, 5.6 ± 1.4. The mean duration of the disease was 11.4 ± 7.8 years (12 ± 7.6 for the MS and 5.75 4.59 for the NMO). All patients were treated with 5 courses of PLEX in 2 weeks, followed by a monthly course for one year.\\n\\nResults: Twenty eight of the 48 patients (58.3 %) improved significantly in the EDSS score at year one post initiation of PLEX. The mean EDSS score declined from 5.91 ± 1.46 at inclusion, to 5.41 ± 1.8 at year one. This improvement was more pronounced in the NMO group: Ten out of twelve patients with NMO (83%) improved and their mean EDSS score was reduced from 5.6 ± 1.4 before the treatment to 4.7 ± 1.5 EDSS score post PLEX. In the whole group there were 16 patients with over imposed relapses (relapsing-progressive course) with a total of 26 relapses in the year prior to the inclusion; the number of relapses during the year following PLEX was reduced from 26 to 4. In general patients with prominent myelitic involvement had the most impressive response to the treatment. Five patients suffered from minor infections and one was admitted with sepsis. No other major side effects were observed.\\n\\nConclusion: PLEX may benefit some patients with progressive MS and NMO and thus may represent an alternative second line treatment modality for such patients with highly active disease, especially those with myelitic forms, and recent deterioration that did not respond to steroids. Larger, controlled studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy of PLEX in these subgroups of MS\\n\\nLB190\\n\\nMaximizing Brain Health in Multiple Sclerosis: A Quality Improvement Framework\\n\\nProf. Jeremy Hobart , Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, Plymouth, United Kingdom, Ms. Maggie Alexander, Consultant in patient involvement in healthcare decision-making, Argolida, Greece, Ms. Amy Bowen, MS Trust, Letchworth Garden City, United Kingdom, Prof. Helmut Butzkueven, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia, Prof. Gavin Giovannoni, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, United Kingdom, Dr. Tom Kenny, Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, University of Bournemouth, Poole, United Kingdom, Dr. Gisela Kobelt, European Health Economics, Mulhouse, France and Dr. Tjalf Ziemssen, Multiple Sclerosis Center, Center of Clinical Neuroscience, Department of Neurology, University Hospital Carl-Gustav Carus, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany\\n\\nCategory: Clinical Trials\\n\\nBackground: A 2015 consensus report (Giovannoni G et al. Mult Scler Relat Disord 2016;9:S5–48) highlights variations in key domains of MS care and makes recommendations for improving MS services.\\n\\nObjectives: To present a quality improvement framework for multiple sclerosis (MS) services that is intended to support healthcare professionals (HCPs) in maximizing lifelong brain health in people with MS.\\n\\nMethods: First, using action–effect methodology, we proposed: (1) a framework of factors affecting MS service delivery; and (2) metrics for assessing quality and changes in quality. Next, we held a UK workshop (09/13/2016) with multidisciplinary HCPs, people with MS, payers and experts in information management to refine the framework and outcome measures. To complement this qualitative approach, we conducted a survey of HCPs at ECTRIMS 2016 (9392 delegates) to assess priorities for quality improvement.\\n\\nResults: The framework focuses on five major factors which contribute to maximizing lifelong brain health in people with MS: (1) early referral, (2) early diagnosis, (3) brain-healthy lifestyle, (4) early treatment with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), and (5) ongoing appropriate treatment with a DMT. At the workshop, these factors were discussed, the proposed framework was refined, and 24 potential outcome measures identified (e.g. for individuals ‘date of diagnosis’; and for clinics ‘proportion of eligible patients taking DMT’). The 72 surveyed HCPs were asked which of the five factors they had tried to improve; the most and least common were: ‘early treatment with a DMT’ (66.7%) and ‘early referral’ (44.4%), respectively. 94.4% of HCPs had tried to improve at least one factor.\\n\\nConclusion: Many HCPs are actively trying to improve MS services. The framework of factors affecting MS service delivery and metrics described here could provide the basis for a quality improvement tool, which could be used by clinicians and by people with MS to improve MS care.\\n\\nLB191\\n\\nEffect of Smoking and Excess Body Weight on Safety Outcomes in the PREFERMS Study of Treatment Retention in Multiple Sclerosis\\n\\nDr. Samuel F Hunter, MD, PhD 1, Dr. Mark Cascione2, Dr. Florian P Thomas, MD, MA, PHD3, Dr. Edward Fox4, Dr. Bruce AC Cree, MD, PhD, MAS5, Dr. Xiangyi Meng6, Dr. Lesley Schofield6, Dr. Fernanda Boulos6 and Dr. Nadia Tenenbaum6\\n\\n1Advanced Neurosciences Institute, Franklin, TN, 2Tampa Neurology Associates, Tampa, FL, 3Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, 4Central Texas Neurology Consultants, Round Rock, TX, 5University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 6Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ\\n\\nCategory: Clinical Trials\\n\\nBackground: Modifiable factors such as smoking and obesity are relevant in multiple sclerosis (MS) because they are associated with increased disability.\\n\\nObjectives: To explore the effects of smoking or excess body weight on adverse event (AE) rates in PREFERMS, a study of treatment retention on fingolimod and on injectable disease-modifying therapies (iDMTs) in patients with relapsing MS.\\n\\nMethods: PREFERMS was a 12-month, phase 4, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study. Patients (either treatment-naïve or treated with one iDMT class [interferon or glatiramer acetate]) were randomized 1:1 to either fingolimod 0.5 mg daily or pre-selected iDMT. One on-study treatment switch was allowed after at least 3 months of treatment, or before if owing to efficacy or safety. In this post hoc subgroup analysis, patients were grouped as having a body mass index (BMI) <25 or ⩾25 kg/m2 and as being current smokers or non-smokers. The study was not powered for subgroup analyses. Post hoc endpoints included retention on randomized treatment, treatment satisfaction (using the patient Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire) and AE rates per patient-year.\\n\\nResults: In all subgroups, more patients completed the study on fingolimod than on iDMTs (all p<0.0001) and satisfaction was greater in patients randomized to fingolimod than to iDMTs (all p<0.0001). AE rates were consistently numerically higher with iDMTs than fingolimod in both BMI subgroups and in the overall population (fingolimod vs iDMT: BMI<25, 4.28 [n=126] vs 6.80 [n=122]; BMI⩾25, 3.90 [n=307] vs 7.09 [n=306]; overall, 4.01 [n=433] vs 7.01 [n=428]). A similar relationship was seen in non-smokers (3.60 [n=328] vs 6.84 [n=318]) and smokers (5.97 [n=105] vs 7.56 [n=110]), but rates in smokers were numerically higher in each treatment group. In smokers, key respiratory infection rates were numerically lower with fingolimod than with iDMTs (upper respiratory tract infection, 0.036 vs 0.164; sinusitis, 0.097 vs 0.164; influenza, 0.000 vs 0.083; pneumonia, 0.012 vs 0.020). Serious AE rates were similar in the overall population, in the BMI and non-smoker subgroups, and in smokers on fingolimod (0.05–0.09), but were about 2-fold higher in smokers on iDMTs (0.16).\\n\\nConclusion: Increased AE rates tended to be associated with smoking but not obesity. Retention and satisfaction tended to be higher with fingolimod than with iDMTs and in smokers, key respiratory infection rates tended to be lower with fingolimod.\\n\\nLB192\\n\\nORY2001 Reduced Lymphocyte Egress and Demyelination in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis; Highlights the Epigenetic Axis in Multiple Sclerosis\\n\\nDr. Tamara Maes 1, Dr. Fernando Cavalcanti1, Dr. Elena Gonzalez-Rey2, Dr. Mario Delgado2, Dr. Cristina Mascaro1, Dr. Serena Lunardi1, Dr. Michele Lufino1 and Dr. Carlos Buesa1\\n\\n1ORYZON GENOMICS S.A., Cornella de Llobregat, Spain, 2Institute of Parasitology and Biomedicine, Granada, Spain\\n\\nCategory: Disease Modifying Therapies- Mechanism of Action\\n\\nBackground: ORY-2001 is a clinical stage Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1) and Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor in development for treatment of neurodegenerative disease. LSD1 demethylates H3K4me1/2 and together with HDAC1/2, forms part of co-repressor complexes recruited by ZNF factors to control transcription. We previously reported that ORY-2001 down-regulates neuroinflammatory genes in the hippocampus of SAMP-8 mice, including S100A9 and T-cell receptor b genes. Up-regulation of S100A9 has been described in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. In this model treatment with ORY-2001 greatly inhibited the development of EAE reducing both disease incidence and severity. A selective LSD1 inhibitor showed significant improvement at some timepoints, while the selective MAO-B inhibitor Rasagiline (3mg/kg) was not effective.\\n\\nObjectives: The objective of this study was to characterize the mode of action (MoA) of ORY-2001 in the EAE model.\\n\\nMethods: Mice were immunized with MOG35-55 following a standard protocol and treated orally with 0.5 mg/kg ORY-2001 during two weeks following onset of symptoms. The clinical score was assessed and animals were sacrificed on day 26 after immunization (10 days after the maximal clinical score). Spleen and lymph nodes were harvested for cell count and cytokine analysis; medulla and brain were harvested for genome wide microarray analysis, cytokine analysis and morphological analysis.\\n\\nResults: Results showed that ORY-2001 a) significantly increased cell count in spleen and lymph nodes without affecting MOG or CD3 cell proliferation, pointing at reduced egress of lymphocytes from these organs b) the immune modulatory effect observed was not generalized but specific to the MOG insult, c) significantly altered chemokine and cytokine levels evaluated by qRT-PCR and ELISA related to inflammatory recruitment, d) induced gene expression changes beyond inflammation, and e) significantly reduced demyelination process.\\n\\nConclusion: The activity of the multiple sclerosis drug fingolimod (FTY720) has been attributed at least in part to its phosphorylated metabolite FTY720-P, which similarly to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) acts as a HDAC1/2 inhibitor. ORY-2001, an inhibitor of LSD1, recapitulated the main aspects of FTY720-P, demonstrating the relevance of the epigenetic axis in the MoA of these existing and candidate MS drugs. Similarities and differences between the MoA of ORY-2001 and fingolimod will be further discussed.\\n\\nLB193\\n\\nAlteration of Thyroid Function Tests Caused by High Dose Biotin Treatment; A Case Report\\n\\nDr. Malcolm H Gottesman, MD , Ms. Lorraine Martone, RN, BSN, Dr. Sharon Friedman-Urevich and Mrs. Denise Grueneberg, Winthrop University Hospital, Mineola, NY\\n\\nCategory: Disease Modifying Therapies- Risk Management\\n\\nBackground: Pilot studies have shown high dose Biotin lessens disability progression in patients with primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS).\\n\\nObjectives: To report a case of reversible altered thyroid function testing (TFT) in an MS patient caused by high dose oral Biotin supplementation treated at the Winthrop University Hospital Comprehensive MS Care Center.\\n\\nMethods: We report a case of significantly altered TFT in a 46 year old white woman with relapsing remitting (RR) MS who was treated with Biotin 100mg three times a day orally for 6 months. TFTs normalized 3 weeks after stopping Biotin.\\n\\nResults: The patient, a 46 year old white woman, was diagnosed with RR MS in 2013. Natalizumab was initiated with excellent result. The history is notable for type 1 diabetes. Her mother had either Grave’s disease or thyroiditis when the patient was a toddler. The patient was told at that time she had an abnormal thyroid antibody but was euthyroid.\\n\\nAt age 24 she had proptosis of one eye, thyroid disease was suspected clinically but TFT were normal. It resolved without intervention.\\n\\nOral Biotin 100 mg three times a day was initiated in January 2016. Pretreatment TSH was normal at 2.079 (.36-5.8) uIU/ml.\\n\\nIn June 2016 TSH studies, performed by 2 different labs were abnormal. Sunrise Medical Lab: TSH, Ultrasensitive: .014 uIU/ml (.27-4.2), Free T-4: > 7.77 NG/DL (.93 -1.70), Free T-4: 7.6 pg/ml (2.0- 4.4). Similar findings were reported from Enzo Clinical Labs.\\n\\nEndocrinology consult showed no clinical evidence of abnormal thyroid status. Biotin was discontinued in July 2016. Ultrasound revealed a 1.2 cm nodule.\\n\\nThyroid biopsy in August 2016 was benign (Category 2), consistent with an adenomatous hyperplastic nodular goiter.\\n\\nTFT results returned to normal within a month of stopping Biotin.\\n\\nConclusion: This patient had markedly abnormal TFT with no clinical evidence of abnormal thyroid function.\\n\\nThe biopsy showed a benign nodule that was felt to be incidental and not related to the abnormal TFT.\\n\\nHigh dose biotin is known to alter the TFT assay and give erroneous values. The prompt normalization of TFT after discontinuing biotin and the patient’s consistent euthyroid clinical status makes interference with the assay by Biotin the most likely cause of the abnormal test results. The biopsy revealed an incidental, non-clinically significant finding. Clinicians who use high dose oral Biotin must be aware of the possibility of interference with the TFT assay.\\n\\nLB194\\n\\nJC Titers in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Patients Treated With Rituximab, Fingolimod and Dimethyl Fumarate at an American MS center\\n\\nDr. Malcolm H Gottesman, MD 1, Dr. Stephen Farley2, Dr. Sharon Friedman-Urevich1, Ms. Janin Ye3, Mrs. Denise Grueneberg1 and Ms. Lorraine Martone, RN, BSN1\\n\\n1Winthrop University Hospital, Mineola, NY, 2Winthrop University Hosptial, Mineola, NY, 3New York University, New York, NY\\n\\nCategory: Disease Modifying Therapies- Risk Management\\n\\nBackground: Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), a potentially fatal viral infection caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus, has occurred as a complication of treatment with Rituximab, Fingolimod and Dimethyl Fumarate. A positive JC titer indicates exposure to the JC virus and potential risk for PML.\\n\\nObjectives: Determine the JC antibody titers in MS patients treated with Rituximab, Fingolimod and Dimethyl Fumarate at our center.\\n\\nMethods: Retrospective chart review of JC antibody titers in MS patients treated at the Winthrop University Hospital Comprehensive MS Center from January 1, 2013 to September 1, 2016. JC index values are reported as: <.20 Negative (Neg), .20-.40 Indeterminate (Indt), >.40 positive (Pos). Some results were obtained prior to titer reporting and are indicated as positive or negative. Some data was not available (NA). The most current value was recorded.\\n\\nResults: 224 patients were evaluated. Female (F): 158, Male (M): 66. Asian (A): 4, Black (B): 37, Caucasian (C): 147, Hispanic (H): 20, NA: 16.\\n\\nRituximab: 36 Patients: F/M: 22/14. A(0), B(7), C(16), H(9), NA(4)\\n\\nJCV Status: Pos: 19 (52%), Neg: 5 (14%), NA: 12 (33%)\\n\\nFingolimod: 58 Patients: F/M: 39/19. A(1), B (11), C(35), H(6), NA(5)\\n\\nJCV Status: Pos: 34 (59%), Indt: 6 (10%), Neg: 8 (14%), NA: 10 (17%)\\n\\nDimethyl Fumarate: 130 Patients: F/M: 97/33. A(3), B(19), C(96), H(5), NA(7)\\n\\nJCV Status: Pos: 64 (49%), Indt: 24 (18%), Neg: 29 (22%), NA: 13 (10%)\\n\\nConclusion: 52% of the patients are known JC antibody positive. Per medication the rates are:\\n\\nFingolimod: 59%, NA 17%\\n\\nRituximab: 52%, NA 33%\\n\\nDimethyl Fumarate: 49%, NA 10%\\n\\nAssuming that 50% of the NA values are positive the estimated Pos rates are:\\n\\nFingolimod: 67%\\n\\nRituximab: 68%\\n\\nDimethyl Fumarate: 55%\\n\\nIt appears in our sample there is an increased rate of JC positivity in patients treated with Fingolimod and Rituximab. The incidence in Dimethyl Fumarate treated patients approximates the the general population. The increased incidence in Fingolimod and Rituximab patients reflects the intentional use of these agents in known JC positive patients.\\n\\nLB195\\n\\nMultiple Sclerosis Associated with Thyroid Dysfunction in a Group of Patients from the Pichincha Province in Ecuador\\n\\nDr. Patricia Gabriela Zambrano , Internist, Universidad Tecnologica Equinoccial, Quito, Ecuador; Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica del Ecuador, Quito, Ecuador and Dr. Felipe Mosquera, Internal Medicine Specialist, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador, Quito, Ecuador; Hospital Carlos Andrade Marin, Quito, Ecuador\\n\\nCategory: Epidemiology\\n\\nBackground: There is little information available about thyroid dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients, most of such data comes from studies that focus on the influence on interferon beta-1b and its relationship with hypothyroidism. Being an Andean country, Ecuador is considered a country with a high prevalence of hypothyroidism\\n\\nObjectives: To analyze the epidemiological profile of hypothyroidism in a group of MS patients in the Pichincha province of Ecuador.\\n\\nMethods: We chose to perform an observational, descriptive cross-cut study in those patients treated for MS at the Hospital Carlos Andrade Marin of Ecuador which were also diagnosed with hypothyroidism during the period going from September 2013 to October 2015.\\n\\nResults: We included 81 patients with MS in which 17.2% (n=14) were also diagnosed with some form of hypothyroidism, from these only one patient was male. The mean of age was 40 years. For those patients with hypothyroidism, the most common subtype of MS was the Remittent Recurrent (RR) variety, accounting for 78.5% of the cases, whereas 21% cases accounted for the progressive types. The association of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM-2) and MS was found in 24% of the study group (n=4). It is worth noting that 14% (n=2) of the patients with MS and hypothyroidism had the diagnosis of other autoimmune disease such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). In our study group 35% (n=5) of these patients had received treatment with interferon beta-1b. As a final observation those patients diagnosed with other autoimmune condition tended to present a higher disability score as measured by the Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) regardless of the subtype of MS. Due to the size of our population we were not able to determine whether there were any differences between the presence of thyroid dysfunction the subtype of MS. However, it is noteworthy that our study showed a higher index of disability in those patient with other autoimmune illness.\\n\\nConclusion: The prevalence of hypothyroidism in our MS patients is similar to that present in other studies, however due to our group’s size we were not able to determine whether it is comparable to that of the general population in our country.\\n\\nLB196\\n\\nCognitive Fatigue is Associated with Diffuse GM Atrophy\\n\\nDr. Alfredo Damasceno , Prof. Benito P Damasceno and Prof. Fernando Cendes, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil\\n\\nCategory: Imaging\\n\\nBackground: Fatigue affects up to 80% of MS patients and significantly impacts their quality of life. Its pathophysiology has been linked to thalamo-striato-cortical network involvement. Cognitive fatigue (CF) is also a common feature among MS patients and can be defined as decreased performance with sustained cognitive effort. However, few studies have addressed the pathophysiology underlying CF.\\n\\nObjectives: To investigate grey-matter damage in mildly disabled MS patients, addressing which variables were associated with CF.\\n\\nMethods: Forty-nine relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and 30 controls underwent MRI (3T). Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). CF was assessed using the PASAT test with with dyad scoring method.\\n\\nResults: Fatigue was present in twenty-two (44.9%) patients. CF was present in 25.5% patients. Compared to patients without CF, those with CF had similar disease duration, EDSS and depression scores. Patients with CF had lower cortical GM volume (F = 20.1; p < 0.001), thalamus volume (F = 6.06; p = 0.005), striatal volume (F = 7.29; p = 0.002) and cerebellar GM volume (F = 26.0; p < 0.001). These findings remained statistically significant after controlling for EDSS.\\n\\nConclusion: MS patients with CF have global cortical and subcortical GM atrophy, independently of physical disability.\\n\\nLB197\\n\\nMRI Evaluation of Thalamic Volume Differentiates MS from Common Mimics\\n\\nDr. Andrew J Solomon 1, Mr. Blake E Dewey2, Dr. Richard Watts1 and Dr. Daniel S Reich3\\n\\n1University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, 2NIH, NINDS, Bethesda, MD, 3NIH-Translational Neuroradiology Section, Bethesda, MD\\n\\nCategory: Imaging\\n\\nBackground: Multiple sclerosis diagnosis remains challenging, and misdiagnosis a frequent problem. New imaging techniques may allow the differentiation of MS from other disorders. Thalamic atrophy has been identified early in the disease course of MS, including in pediatric MS, pre-symptomatic MS, clinically isolated syndrome, and early diagnosed MS. Tractography studies suggest that thalamic volume loss might be due to disruption of thalamocortical pathways caused by white matter lesions.\\n\\nObjectives: To determine if MRI evaluation of thalamic volume differentiates MS from other disorders causing MRI white matter abnormalities.\\n\\nMethods: There were 40 study subjects: ten cases each of MS with and without additional comorbidities for white matter abnormalities (MS+c and MS-c); ten cases of migraine, MRI white matter abnormalities, and no additional cormorbidities for white matter abnormalities (Mi-c); and ten cases with various diagnoses who were previously incorrectly diagnosed with MS (Misdx). T1-MPRAGE and T2-weighted 3D FLAIR sequences were acquired on a Phillips Achieva d-Stream 3T MRI in all subjects, and scans were randomly ordered and de-identified for a blinded reviewer who performed MRI segmentation using LesionTOADS.\\n\\nResults: An analysis of variance of thalamic volume was significant (p=0.005). Thalamic mean volumes were smaller in the 20 MS cases compared to the 20 non-MS cases (p<0.001). Mean thalamic volume was smaller in MS-c compared to Mi-c (p=0.03), and smaller in MS+c compared to Misdx (p=0.006). There was no difference in mean thalamic volumes between MS-c and MS+c (p=0.24). MS cases were 3 times more likely (15/20 vs 5/20) to have normalized thalamic volume <0.0077. ANOVA was nonsignificant for caudate or putamen volumes, and caudate and putamen mean volumes were not significantly different between MS and non-MS.\\n\\nConclusion: MRI evaluation of thalamic volumes, but not other deep gray matter structures, differentiated MS from other diseases causing white matter abnormalities that are often mistaken for MS. This suggests that thalamocortical pathways may be disproportionately affected in MS compared to other causes of white matter disease. Further prospective study of MRI evaluation of thalamic volume in patients with suspected MS may provide data for its value in for improving diagnostic accuracy.\\n\\nLB198\\n\\nChromatin-modifying enzymes and histone H3 acetylation is altered in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis\\n\\nDr. Amanda K Huber, PhD 1, Dr. Benjamin M Segal, MD1 and Dr. David Irani, M.D.2\\n\\n1University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 2University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI\\n\\nCategory: Imaging\\n\\nBackground: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that is driven by both genetic and environmental factors. MS shows pathological and clinical heterogeneity, and patients manifest variable responses to different disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Despite decades of genome-wide association studies and candidate-gene based approaches, relatively few genes, with the exception of HLA, have been shown strongly associated with MS. Those identified to date have only modest effects on disease susceptibility (OR 1.03-1.50), and collectively account for only ~25% of MS heritability. Therefore, other non-genetic mechanisms, such as epigenetic modifications, may be important in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.\\n\\nObjectives: To determine whether differences in chromatin-modifying enzymes and global expression of histone H3 modifications exist in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from relapsing-remitting (RR)-MS patients compared to healthy controls (HC).\\n\\nMethods: PBMCs from treatment naive healthy controls and RRMS patients at baseline and 6 months after starting on the DMT IFN-β were collected. RNA and total cellular lysates, including the nuclear fraction, were prepared from these cells. Chromatin-modifying enzymes were analyzed from the RNA using a multiplex QPCR array. Total H3 acetylation was measured from protein cellular lysates using ELISA.\\n\\nResults: Enzymes responsible for histone acetylation, were dysregulated in RRMS compared to HC. Consistent with modifying enzyme changes in these patients, treatment naive RRMS patients demonstrated decreased levels of global histone H3 acetylation, although not significant, compared to HC. After 6 months of IFN-β treatment, global H3 acetylation in these same RRMS patients was slightly decreased compared to their treatment naive levels, and was significantly less than a similarly drawn HC.\\n\\nConclusion: These data suggest there is dysregulated chromatin-modifying enzyme expression and decreased global H3 acetylation in RRMS patients compared to HC, and that IFN-β treatment further increases this difference. These preliminary studies were performed using whole PBMCs, and the data cannot define the extent to which a single immune cell subset contributes to these differences. Future studies analyzing exact epigenetic differences in specific immune cell subsets during RRMS are needed to define which modifications in which cell subsets may be important to RRMS disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.\\n\\nLB199\\n\\nSpinal Cord Gray Matter Atrophy is Detectable at an Early Stage of Multiple Sclerosis\\n\\nDr. Regina M Schlaeger 1,2, Dr. Nico Papinutto, PhD3, Ms. Alyssa Zhu, BS4, Ms. Carolyn Bevan, MD3, Dr. Eduardo Caverzasi, MD3, Ms. Kesshi Jordan5, Dr. Iryna Lobach5, Ms. Anisha Keshavan6, Dr. Antje Bischof3, Ms. Gina Kirkish3, Mr. William Stern5, Mr. Michael Devereux3, Mr. Nicholas Baker3, Dr. Riley Bove, M.D.5, Dr. Jeffrey Gelfand, MD5, Dr. Jennifer S Graves, MD, PhD, MAS1, Dr. Ari Green3, Dr. Michael Wilson5, Dr. Emmanuelle Waubant, MD, PhD1, Dr. Douglas Goodin, MD5, Dr. Bruce AC Cree, MD, PhD, MAS5, Prof. Stephen L Hauser, MD5 and Dr. Roland G Henry, PhD1,5,7\\n\\n1University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 2University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland, 3University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 4Imaging Genetics Center, Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 5UCSF, San Francisco, CA, 6University of San Francisco, California, San Francisco, CA, 7University of California San Francisco and Berkeley, San Francisco, CA\\n\\nCategory: Imaging\\n\\nBackground: Spinal cord (SC) gray matter (GM) atrophy was recently described in vivo in patients with long-standing multiple sclerosis (MS) and was shown to correlate with disability and disease type.\\n\\nObjectives: To estimate SC GM area’s potential as a biomarker of disease progression, it is important to understand how early in the MS course SC GM atrophy can be detected, which parts of the cord are affected, and the relationship to SC relapses and T2-lesions.\\n\\nMethods: As part of an observational cohort study, one hundred seventeen subjects were scanned with axial 2D-phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) MRI at 3T: Sixty-four patients at an early stage of MS (mean disease duration from first symptom onset 1.2 years (0–4 years), mean age 36.9 years, median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score 2.0, 44 women) and fifty-three healthy controls (mean age 37.4 years, 38 women). PSIR images were acquired at the intervertebral disc levels C2/C3 and T9/10. EDSS scores were determined in patients.\\n\\nResults: In cervical and thoracic SC, patients had significantly smaller GM areas than controls (C2/C3: p=0.005; T9/T10: p=0.041), but had no significant difference in either the SC white matter (WM) or total cord areas. Cervical and thoracic GM areas were not correlated with the number of SC T2-lesions. In the subgroup of patients without prior SC relapses (N=32), a multivariable model based on cervical SC GM area as the predictor variable with age and sex as covariates explained 48% of EDSS variance. While in the patients with prior SC relapses there was no significant association between SC GM area and EDSS, the number of SC T2-lesions did predict 26% of EDSS variance in this subgroup in a linear model (with age and sex as covariates).\\n\\nConclusion: SC GM atrophy is already detectable at an early stage of MS, in absence of detectable WM atrophy, and affects both the cervical and thoracic cord.\\n\\nLB200\\n\\nDoes White Matter Tract Damage Affect Task Related fMRI Activation in Multiple Sclerosis Related Cognitive Impairment?\\n\\nDr. Flavia Nelson 1, Dr. Joel L Steinberg2, Dr. Zafer Keser3, Dr. Jeffrey Wilken4 and Prof. Khader M Hasan3\\n\\n1University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston/ McGovern Medical School, Houston, TX, 2Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, 3University of Texas Health Science Center-Houston, Houston, TX, 4Georgetown University Medical Center, Faifax, VA\\n\\nCategory: Imaging\\n\\nBackground: Multiple sclerosis (MS) related cognitive impairment (CI) has been shown to correlate with increased functional connectivity by functional MRI (fMRI), in conjunction with wide spread structural tract damage by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Task related activation based on cognitive paradigms, has not been associated with structural damage of cognition related white matter pathways or with cortical diffusivity by DTI.\\n\\nObjectives: To evaluate the main cognition related long association tracts, and regional cortical gray matter (rCGM) using DTI-based tractography and to look at their associations with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation by fMRI in MS patients with and without CI.\\n\\nMethods: 50 MS patients [EDSS 0-7 mean (m) =3.2, DD 1-37 yr. m=12, age 18-58 yr. m=40, 46RR, 3 SP, 1 PR] underwent the minimal assessment of cognitive function in MS (MACFIMS) and an fMRI session with a novel fMRI paradigm shown to detect CI in MS; the Immediate/Delayed Memory Task (I/DMT). DTI-derived measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were obtained and statistically analyzed for associations with CI after adjusting for age, lesion load, and education. BOLD activation between non-impaired (MSNI) and impaired (MSCI) patients was calculated based on I/DMT and correlated with DTI derived measures.\\n\\nResults: MSNI patients (N=10) had significantly greater BOLD activation than MSCI (N=30) in portions of the left (L) middle frontal gyrus (g), L superior frontal g, L superior medial frontal g, and L supplementary motor area (2-tailed FWE-corrected cluster, p=0.032; cluster extent=529 voxels). CI correlated with decreased FA in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus [r=0.52; p=0.001], inferior longitudinal fasciculus [r=0.43; p=0.008], dentorubro-thalamic tracts [r=0.46; p=0.004], cingulum [r=0.49; p=0.002], and with regional cortical thicknesses of the isthmus-cingulate, middle and superior temporal cortices [r=-0.60, (p= 0.0002), -0.59 (p=0.0003) and -0.41 (p=0.01)]. In regression analysis BOLD activation showed an inverse correlation with MD, in the same area of the L frontal cortex (r=-0.341, p=0.024) but no association was found between BOLD activation and FA of the adjacent cognition related white matter tracts.\\n\\nConclusion: Regional cortical damage by DTI, correlates with fMRI based task related BOLD activation in MS related CI, but associations with structural damage of cognitive pathways adjacent to the BOLD signal was not seen.\\n\\nLB201\\n\\nDiffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging Parameters of Acute Multiple Sclerosis Lesions can Predict Persistent Black Holes\\n\\nDr. Lindsey Wooliscroft 1, Mr. Gautam Adusumilli1, Mr. Zachary Goodman1, Dr. Peng Sun, PhD2, Dr. Ajit George1, Ms. Samantha Lancia3, Dr. Kathryn Trinkaus, PhD3, Dr. Robert Naismith2, Prof. Victor Song2 and Prof. Anne H Cross, MD2\\n\\n1Washington University in St., Saint Louis, MO, 2Washington University in St. Louis - School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 3Washington University, St Louis, MO\\n\\nCategory: Imaging\\n\\nBackground: Around 35% of contrast-enhancing lesions (CELs) in multiple sclerosis (MS) evolve into persistent black holes (PBHs), which have greater axonal loss than non-black holes. We previously used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters to predict PBH formation. Diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) is the next generation diffusion technique, which models diffusion weighted MR signals as a linear combination of multiple anisotropic diffusion tensors (representing axon fibers and tracts) and a spectrum of isotropic diffusion tensors (representing cells, edema and extracellular water). DBSI resolves the confounding effect of crossing fibers and quantitatively identifies inflammation that confound DTI interpretation.\\n\\nObjectives: To determine if DBSI of CELs can predict the subsequent development of PBHs, which are a surrogate of tissue damage and axonal loss.\\n\\nMethods: Ten MS patients with CELs were imaged monthly on a 3.0T Siemens Trio scanner until enhancement ceased. A region of interest (ROI) representing the CEL was drawn on the T1W postcontrast image at time of maximum contrast-enhancement. DBSI-determined parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivity, and fiber fraction for the CEL were compared to an ROI drawn on contralateral normal-appearing white matter. Twelve months later, development of PBH or persistent gray hole (PGH) was determined by two examiners with a third adjudicator. Generalized estimating equations models were used to estimate the probability of becoming a PBH (vs. PGH vs. no black hole) using DBSI-derived parameters from multilevel imaging data. Probabilities were adjusted for lesion volume and enhancement duration.\\n\\nResults: The probability of becoming a PBH at 12 months decreased with increasing fiber fraction, fiber axial diffusivity, fiber FA and restricted isotropic fraction at baseline. Odds ratios were 0.02 (95% CI: .0086 – 0.11), 0.06 (95% CI: .021 – 0.19), 0.02 (95% CI: .0071 – 0.077), and 0.04 (95% CI: .015 – 0.093), respectively.\\n\\nConclusion: The probability of an acute CEL evolving into a PBH 12 months later decreases as the DBSI parameters of fiber fraction (apparent axon density), fiber axial diffusion (consistent with less axonal injury), fiber FA (consistent with less axonal injury) and restricted isotropic fraction (apparent cell density) increase.\\n\\nLB202\\n\\nImaging Predictors for the Transition from Relapsing to Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis\\n\\nDr. Antje Bischof 1,2, Dr. Nico Papinutto, PhD2, Ms. Anisha Keshavan2, Ms. Carolyn Bevan, MD2, Ms. Gina Kirkish2, Mr. William Stern2, Ms. Alyssa Zhu, BS3, Dr. Elizabeth Crabtree-Hartmann, MD2, Dr. Jeffrey Gelfand, MD2, Dr. Douglas Goodin, MD2, Dr. Jennifer S Graves, MD, PhD, MAS2, Dr. Ari Green2, Dr. Regina M Schlaeger2,4, Dr. Emmanuelle Waubant, MD, PhD2, Dr. Scott Zamvil2, Dr. Bruce AC Cree, MD, PhD, MAS2, Prof. Stephen L Hauser, MD2 and Dr. Roland G Henry, PhD2\\n\\n1Basel University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, 2University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 3Imaging Genetics Center, Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 4University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland\\n\\nCategory: Imaging\\n\\nBackground: Despite partially effective anti-inflammatory treatment, some patients with relapsing MS (RMS) transition to a secondary progressive disease course. Conversion to SPMS is known to be highly variable (Lorscheider et al, 2016), and objective biomarkers for the prediction of SPMS are sorely needed. MRI provides a sensitive in vivobiomarker for both, the inflammatory and neurodegenerative component of MS.\\n\\nObjectives: Utilizing a large longitudinally monitored MS cohort designated “EPIC” (Cree et al, 2016), we evaluated the predictive value of brain and spinal cord MRI parameters for conversion to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) focusing on a subset of patients who transitioned after enrollment.\\n\\nMethods: From the EPIC cohort, 10% or 42 patients with RMS transitioned to SPMS during the 12-year observation period, and these individuals were matched for age, sex and disease duration to 42 patients with relapsing remitting disease. Brain T1 and T2 and cervical cord T2 lesion load were analyzed longitudinally in a subset of 20 patients for whom this data existed. Upper cervical cord area was measured on T1 weighted brain images on 5 consecutive slices 20 to 25 cm caudally to the inferior margin of the pons, according to Liu et al. (Liu et al, 2015)\\n\\nResults: Patients who transitioned to SPMS had more enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions within the spinal cord before and after transition to SPMS than did patients with RMS. Notably, there was an accelerated loss of total cord area in the SPMS group compared to patients with RRMS before and after the transition to SPMS. There was a difference in the ventricular expansion between the patients who transitioned to SPMS and RRMS patients.\\n\\nConclusion: Compared with RMS patients who did not develop SPMS, patients transitioning to SPMS exhibited more active inflammatory spinal cord disease as well as accelerated loss of cervical cord volume before and after developing clinically progressive disease.\\n\\nLB203\\n\\nThe MS-Associated Gut Microbiome\\n\\nDr. Sergio E Baranzini, PhD 1, Dr. Egle Cekanaviciute, PhD2, Dr. Justine Debelius, PhD3, Ms. Sneha Singh1, Dr. Tessel Runia4, Mr. Bryan Yoo5, Dr. Elizabeth Crabtree-Hartmann, MD6, Dr. Riley Bove, M.D.6, Dr. Jeffrey Gelfand, MD6, Dr. Sherman Jia1, Dr. Jennifer S Graves, MD, PhD, MAS7, Mr. John Morrissey1, Prof. Stephen L Hauser, MD7, Prof. Sarkis Mazmanian8, Prof. Rob Knight9, Dr. Ilana Katz Sand, M.D.10, Prof. Patrizia Casaccia11, Dr. Bruce AC Cree, MD, PhD, MAS7, Mrs. Refujia Gomez12 and Dr. Ari Green6\\n\\n1UCSF School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, 2University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, 3University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 4Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands, 5TBD, Pasadena, CA, 6UCSF, San Francisco, CA, 7University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 8Cal Tech, Pasadena, CA, 9University of California, La Jolla, CA, 10Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 11Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 12University of California, San Francisco, CA\\n\\nCategory: Microbiome\\n\\nBackground: An essential function of the gut microbiota is to regulate immune responses, including T lymphocyte functions in health and disease.\\n\\nObjectives: We hypothesized that gut microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of MS.\\n\\nMethods: We analyzed the microbiome of stool samples from 64 treatment-naïve MS patients and 68 healthy controls using amplicon sequencing of the 16S V4 region of the rRNA gene. We characterized immune profiles of cultured PBMC in response to specific bacteria harbored by MS patients.\\n\\nResults: We found that MS patients exhibited impaired in-vitro Treg differentiation in response to their own microbiota. No major shifts in microbial community structure were observed. However, we were able to identify individual microbial taxa that were significantly associated with MS and studied their ability to regulate primary human T lymphocyte differentiation in vitro.\\n\\nWe next conducted in-vitro assays to characterize the functional properties of the MS gut microbiota. We found that MS-associated Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was sufficient to reduce Treg differentiation and increase both Th1 and Th2 differentiation. The expansion of Th1 lymphocytes was recapitulated by Akkermansia muciniphila, which was also more abundant in MS patients. In contrast, Parabacteroidesdistasonis, which was significantly reduced in MS microbiomes, stimulated CD4+ T lymphocyte differentiation into a CD25+ IL-10+ regulatory phenotype. Our results suggest that MS-associated changes in microbiota alter T lymphocyte differentiation in a complex fashion and likely through multiple mechanisms.\\n\\nFinally, microbiota transplants from MS patients into germ-free mice results in more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and reduced Tregs compared to controls.\\n\\nConclusion: This study identifies specific human gut bacteria that regulate adaptive autoimmune responses, suggesting therapeutic targeting of the microbiota as a novel treatment for MS.\\n\\nLB204\\n\\nVariations in the Gut Microbiome in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis\\n\\nDr. Evdokia Eleftheriou 1, Ms. Simona Nedelcu2, Ms. Lauren Hall2, Ms. Carolyn Griffin3, Dr. Ana Luisa Maldonado-Contreras1, Dr. Beth McCormick4, Dr. Doyle Ward1, Dr. Raffi Aroian2 and Dr. Carolina Ionete, MD, PHD5\\n\\n1University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA, 2University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, 3University of Massacusetts Memorial Medical Center, Worcester, MA, 4University of Massachusetts Center for Microbiome Research, Worcester, MA, 5UMASS, WORCESTER, MA\\n\\nCategory: Microbiome\\n\\nBackground: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Most patients present as a relapsing remitting form, the majority of which enter a progressive stage with fewer relapses. The gut microbiome consists of thousands of bacterial species and studies in animal models and in humans have shown significant differences in species between individuals. The development and maintenance of the microbiome may be influential in autoimmune diseases, such as MS. A number of small case-control studies were able to demonstrate significant differences between the microbiome in MS patients and healthy controls.\\n\\nObjectives: Our goal was to identify the composition of intestinal microflora in patients with relapsing MS, during an acute flare or stable disease, and compare with healthy controls, in order to demonstrate variations in gut microflora between the acute and stable stages of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis.\\n\\nMethods: Fecal samples were collected from a total of 10 relapsing MS patients, 8 patients with acute flares and 2 with stable disease, and 3 healthy controls. DNA was extracted from the samples using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit. 16S rDNA community profiling and sequencing was used to identify the microbiome composition. Patient demographic and clinical data was obtained from medical records. Additional fecal samples are being collected in MS patients with acute flares and compared to samples obtained two weeks later to further assess differences in microbiome longitudinally. These data will be presented at the meeting.\\n\\nResults: Significant differences are noted in the composition of gut microbiota regarding alpha diversity and beta diversity between the acute flare MS group and both the control and stable MS group. Levels of Firmicutes-Clostridium IV, Bacteroidetes and Barnesiella are increased in patients with active disease when compared to both the stable disease and control groups.\\n\\nConclusion: Our results show differences between relapsing MS patients with active disease and both patients with stable MS and healthy controls. This supports the hypothesis that the gut microbiome has an important influence in autoimmune disease. Our ultimate goal is to further investigate these differences in microflora to determine biomarkers as predictors of disease activity as well as potential therapeutic interventions to control disease activity.\\n\\nLB205\\n\\nPredicting Visual Function Clinical Outcome in MS: A MRI and OCT Metrics Study\\n\\nDr. Christian Cordano 1,2, Dr. Eduardo Caverzasi, MD1,3, Ms. Alyssa Zhu, BS4, Dr. Antje Bischof1,5, Ms. Gina Kirkish6, Dr. Nico Papinutto, PhD6, Mr. Michael Devereux1, Mr. Nicholas Baker1, Mr. Sam Arnow1, Mr. Justin Inman1, Mr. Hao Yiu1, Ms. Carolyn Bevan, MD1, Dr. Jeffrey Gelfand, MD6, Dr. Bruce AC Cree, MD, PhD, MAS1, Prof. Stephen L Hauser, MD1, Dr. Roland G Henry, PhD6 and Dr. Ari Green1\\n\\n1University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 2University of Genova, Genova, Italy, 3University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy, 4Imaging Genetics Center, Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 5Basel University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, 6University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA\\n\\nCategory: Neuro - Ophthalmology\\n\\nBackground: Tissue injury underlies neurological dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the relationship between structural abnormalities and functional impairment is unknown.The visual pathway (AVP) has shown promise as a highly informative isolated functional system useful for studying the pathological processes that underlie permanent neurological dysfunction in multiple sclerosis. Functional impairment – including both psychophysical dysfunction and electrophysiological response - as well as structural injury along the entire pathway can be quantitatively assayed in the visual system.\\n\\nObjectives: To investigate the relative contribution of different MRI and OCT metrics to visual performance measured by low contrast letter acuity (LCLA) and visual evoked potentials (VEP), in MS patients.\\n\\nMethods: 50 patients enrolled in a clinical trial were studied (age 40.1±10 years, EDSS 2.1±1, and disease duration 5.1±5 years) looking at baseline values and assessments (prior to treatment). Twenty-six patients had a previous history of optic neuritis. MRI: The thalamus, cerebellar cortex and primary visual area were parcellated from MPRAGE volumes as volumes of interest (VOIs) using Freesurfer. Maps of mean diffusivity (MD), orientation dispersion index (ODI) and “myelin water” content were computed. Mean values per each MRI metric were calculated within each VOI averaging left and right hemisphere. Number of occipital cortical lesions and total white matter lesion burden in the optic radiation were detected/segmented by an expert neuroradiologist. OCT: Spectral-Domain OCT (Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering). We evaluated peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness and macular volume with automated segmentation of retinal layers for the quantification of Ganglion Cell Layer (GCL) thickness.\\n\\nResults: We performed a partial least square regression analysis to model LCLA and VEP based on a combination of demographics, MRI (MD, myelin, ODI) and OCT metrics (GCL, pRNFL) considering negative/positive history of optic neuritis. We identified model predictor of LCLA with R-squared up to 0.39 and 0.36 for optic neuritis negative and positive respectively. We determined model predictor of VEP with R-squared up to 0.48 (ON negative) and 0.63 (ON positive).\\n\\nConclusion: A combination of MRI and OCT metrics strongly describe visual dysfunction. These preliminary results may improve the understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying clinical dysfunction in multiple sclerosis.\\n\\nLB206\\n\\nClinical Spectrum of Brainstem Involvement in NMOSD AQP4 IgG Seropositive Patients\\n\\nDr. Alfonso S Lopez Chiriboga , Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL\\n\\nCategory: Neuromyelitis Optica\\n\\nBackground: Acute brainstem syndrome is one of the core clinical characteristics for the diagnostic criteria of NMOSD due to the complex anatomy and function of the brainstem the clinical presentation is diverse.\\n\\nObjectives: To describe the clinical spectrum of brainstem manifestations in AQP4 IgG seropositive patients.\\n\\nMethods: Literature review.\\n\\nResults: Brainstem manifestations in patients with NMOSD are not uncommon. In a large multicenter study, up to 31.4% of patients were found to have evidence of brainstem symptoms, studies suggest that the prevalence of MO involvement ranges from 84 to 91%. Besides hiccups, intractable nausea and vomit, other symptoms described in NMOSD with AQP4 include: Pathological yawning, severe orthostatic hypotension, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, respiratory failure, intractable cough, paroxysmal sneezing, hypogeusia, cranial neuropathies such as: oculomotor dysfunction, facial palsy, trigeminal neuralgia, hearing loss/vestibulopathy.\\n\\nConclusion: The spectrum of NMOSD continues to expand and symptoms at presentation can be diverse, recognition of brainstem involvement and early AQP4 serostatus in patients with NMOSD is important as early immunotherapy is essential to prevent significant disability, serious complications, or death.\\n\\nLB207\\n\\nEstrogen Receptor Beta Ligand Acts on Peripheral Myeloid Cells to Mediate Protection in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis\\n\\nMr. Roy Y Kim , Ms. Alexandrea S Hoffmann, Mr. Darian Mangu, Ms. Eunice Jung, Ms. Noriko Itoh and Prof. Rhonda Voskuhl, M.D., University of California - Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA\\n\\nCategory: Neuroprotection and Neuroregeneration\\n\\nBackground: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the most widely used animal model to understand disease mechanisms in MS. Treatments with estrogens and specific ligands of estrogen receptors (ERs) are neuroprotective in EAE. Given the need for neuroprotective treatments in MS, understanding mechanisms of estrogen mediated neuroprotection may lead to new treatment strategies. CD11c+ myeloid cells play a role in pathogenesis of EAE and MS, and ERβ expression on these cells has been shown. However, the functional significance of ERβ on CNS resident microglia and/or peripherally derived dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages in vivo during EAE has not been studied.\\n\\nObjectives: Investigate whether ERβ-ligand treatment directly targets ERβ on CD11c+ cells to mediate neuroprotection in vivo during EAE.\\n\\nMethods: We created mice with specific deletion of ERβ on CD11c+ cells using the Cre-LoxP system, by crossing CD11c-Cre-EGFP (CD11ccre/+) mice and ERβflox/flox mice to generate CD11ccre/+ERβflox/flox (CKO) mice. CKO mice and their littermate controls (WT) were induced with EAE, then treated with either ERβ-ligand or vehicle. Clinical EAE scores and neuropathology were performed. To distinguish between effects of ERβ on CNS resident microglia versus peripherally derived DCs and macrophages, bone marrow chimera experiments commenced.\\n\\nResults: Effects of ERβ-ligand treatment in WT EAE mice improved clinical EAE scores, spared of axons and myelin, and decreased MHCII and iNOS expression on Iba1+ myeloid cells in spinal cord white matter. These neuroprotective effects were lost in CKO EAE mice, thereby demonstrating that protection was mediated through direct effects of ERβ expressed on CD11c+ cells. Finally, bone marrow chimeras demonstrated that these neuroprotective effects were mediated through ERβ on bone marrow derived CD11c+ DCs and macrophages, and not CNS resident CD11c+microglia.\\n\\nConclusion: Our results reveal that peripheral bone marrow derived CD11c+ DCs and macrophages can modulate the inflammatory microenvironment in the CNS to promote neuroprotection during EAE. Together this suggests these cells as targets for novel treatments in MS, specifically through modulation of ERβ signaling pathways.\\n\\nLB208\\n\\nPoor Sleep Quality Contributes to Impaired Cognition Among MS Patients, Independent of Duration and Functional Resting State Abnormalities\\n\\nDr. Franklin C Brown, Ph.D. 1, Ms. Kristen Vitelli, B.A.2, Dr. Matthew Heinly, Ph.D.2, Dr. Dustin Scheinost, Ph.D.1, Ms. Cheryl Lacade, M.S.1, Dr. R T Constable, Ph.D.1 and Dr. Daniel Pelletier, MD3\\n\\n1Yale University, New Haven, CT, 2Central Connecticut State University, New Britain, CT, 3University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA\\n\\nCategory: Neuropsychology and Cognition\\n\\nBackground: MS patients are at much higher risk for sleep abnormalities than healthy controls. This contributed to daytime fatigue, and cognitive abnormalities in some relatively small studies, or when limited to only MS patients with sleep apnea.\\n\\nObjectives: We explore the hypotheses that poor sleep quality is associated with 1) greater daytime fatigue, 2) daytime sleepiness, 3) cognitive difficulties, 4) more severe MS symptoms, 5) abnormal resting state whole brain connectivity, and MRI third ventricle, white matter, whole brain parenchymal, and thalamic structural volumes.\\n\\nMethods: 58 MS patients, and 49 controls who met full study criteria completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Fatigue Severity Scale, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Cognitive functioning was measured with the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Functions in MS (MACFIMS) which includes the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), Symbol Digits Modalities Test (SDMT) and other measures; the Brown Location Test (BLT) was added as a measure of allocentric visual memory, and the auditory version of Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) as a measure of sustained attention. MS Functional Composite was used as a disease severity rating. Resting state functional MRI data was collected from the MS patients, and analyzed for whole brain connectivity.\\n\\nResults: 60.3% of MS patients reported poor sleep quality which was associated with fatigue and sleepiness. A two-way MANOVA indicated that PASAT, SDMT, Verbal Memory, and Sustained attention reaction time were significantly associated with sleep quality, but not MS disease presence. On the other hand, allocentric visual memory was strongly associated with MS disease, but much more weakly sleep quality. Resting state fMRI abnormalities related to MS duration were associated with allocentric visual memory, but not sleep quality, PASAT, or SDMT performance. Poor sleep quality was associated with lower third ventricle volume but not other more specific volumetrics.\\n\\nConclusion: Despite years of support for the PASAT and SDMT among MS patients, this study is the first to find that such problems may be due to poor sleep quality rather than direct effects of the disease which was not previously explored. On the other hand, these results also suggested that poor sleep quality may be associated with more brain atrophy. These results suggest an important relationship between sleep quality, cognitive complaints, and brain atrophy.\\n\\nDisclosure: This study was funded by EMD Serono\\n\\nLB209\\n\\nThe Relationship of Information Processing and Multitasking Performance in MS\\n\\nMs. Martina Azar1, Dr. Chelsea L Morse1, Ms. Rebecca Williams1, Dr. Ivan Panyavin1, Mr. Shyam Patel1, Ms. Riley Ciabattoni1, Mr. Thomas P. Leist, MD, PhD2 and Dr. Maria Schultheis 1\\n\\n1Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, 2Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA\\n\\nCategory: Neuropsychology and Cognition\\n\\nBackground: Executive dysfunction is a predominant feature of multiple sclerosis that affects vocational, personal, and social outcomes. Specifically, individuals with MS experience problems with multitasking and information processing.\\n\\nObjectives: The current study sought to understand the relationships between performance on tasks of information processing and change in performance on a manualized vocational multitasking test, which is representative of every day executive difficulties in a vocational setting. Exploring these associations can better inform which neuropsychological instruments represent measures that are more functionally meaningful.\\n\\nMethods: Twenty-two individuals with MS completed a demographics questionnaire, neuropsychological measures of information processing (SDMT, PASAT) and a Vocational Multitasking Test (VMT). The latter task was administered at two different time points, generally one week apart. Correlations were run between neuropsychological test scores and performance change score on the VMT. A linear regression was performed to examine if the SDMT and/or the PASAT were predictive of change in performance on the VMT.\\n\\nResults: Individuals’ performance on the VMT at baseline (M=27.74, SD=14.60) was compared to their performance at follow up(M=36.71, SD=19.05).The change in performance score(M=9.30, SD=12.10) was statistically significant t(22)=-3.69,p<.01. Performance on the Oral SDMT (M=-0.85, SD=1.16) was positively correlated with change in vocational multitasking performance from Time 1 to Time 2(r=0.44, p<0.05), while PASAT 3-second task (M=-1.12, SD=1.56)was not correlated with performance change(r=0.04,p=0.86). Further,SDMT performance predicted performance change on the VMT task F(1,19)= 4.60, β= 5.34, p<0.05.\\n\\nConclusion: Individuals with MS frequently experience cognitive and executive deficits, which are often difficult to fully capture on neuropsychological tasks. Individuals’ performance on these specific tasks may not reflect their nuanced deficits on tasks that are encountered during their day to day functioning. The current findings indicate that the SDMT might be a better predictor of multitasking performance, and performance change across time. Furthermore, the SDMT may tap on specific information processing deficits that resemble ecologically valid measures, such as the VMT. Future research should extend these findings to other domains of executive functioning affected in MS, and see how performance on these specific tasks translates to everyday functioning deficits.\\n\\nLB210\\n\\nCCR6+Th1 and Th17 Cells in Multiple Sclerosis\\n\\nDr. Seema Kalra , Keele University, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom; University Hospital North Midlands, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom, Dr. John S Curnow, Birmingham University, Birmingham, United Kingdom and Prof. Clive P Hawkins, Keele University, University Hospital North Midlands, United Kingdom\\n\\nCategory: Pathogenesis- Immunology\\n\\nBackground: Th17 cells are involved in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Their absolute frequencies are relatively small but they are plastic and phenotypically variable. CCR6 has been described to be a Th17 lineage marker. In rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, CCR6 expression has been associated with disease activity. Over the last couple of years we have been focussed on the Th17-lineage and associated cells in MS. The expression of CCR6 on the Th1 cells signifies their origin from Th17 lineage.\\n\\nObjectives: To investigate if the phenotype and frequencies of pathogenic T cells – Th1, Th17 and Th17 lineage cells are altered in MS and if these correlate with relapsing and/or progressive phase.\\n\\nMethods: We recruited 100 MS patients (50 relapsing-remitting-RRMS & 50 secondary progressive-SPMS); 50 age/ gender-matched controls (HC) from Neurology Department, University Hospital North Midlands. Median age of the patients was 49 years (male=28, female=72). All SPMS patients and 50% of RRMS patients were treatment naïve. Isolated blood cells and CSF cells were stimulated in vitro and labelled with antibodies against surface and intracellular cytokines followed by flow cytometry.\\n\\nResults: Frequencies of Th17 cells (CD4+IL17+ cells) were increased in periphery in MS as compared to HC group (p< 0.05). There was no significant difference in total Th1 cell frequencies (CD4+ IFNγ+ cells) in MS vs. HCs but the frequencies of CCR6+ Th1 cells were significantly increased in MS (p< 0.05). Frequencies of Th17-Th1 were also raised in MS as compared to HV (p<0.005).\\n\\nConclusion: CCR6+ Th1, Th17 and Th17-Th1 frequencies are all increased in MS in spite of no significant change in total Th1 cell frequencies. This signifies the role of Th17 lineage cells is greater than realized by their absolute numbers.\\n\\nLB211\\n\\nPersistence, Adverse Events, and Relapse in Patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis and Initiated on IFN Beta-1a or Dimethyl Fumarate\\n\\nMs. Schiffon L Wong 1, Mr. Riad Elmor2, Ms. Peri Barr2 and Mr. Frank Ernst2\\n\\n1EMD Serono, Billerica, MA, 2Indegene, Kennesaw, GA\\n\\nCategory: Real World Evidence\\n\\nBackground: The introduction of new disease modifying therapies (DMTs) merits estimation of their real world effectiveness compared to previously available DMTs.\\n\\nObjectives: This study compares persistence, adverse events, and relapse between patients with relapsing remitting multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) on IFN beta-1a or dimethyl fumarate.\\n\\nMethods: A United States retrospective medical chart review of 450 randomly selected adult RRMS patients who received IFN beta-1a or dimethyl fumarate was conducted. Patients were newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve, and initiating first-line treatment with IFN beta-1a or dimethyl fumarate or previously treated, switching to IFN beta-1a or dimethyl fumarate. Persistence was defined as being prescribed either agent, continuously, from initiation to 730 days until discontinuing medication or censored. Patient characteristics, persistence, and adverse events between treatment groups were compared using t-tests or chi-square tests. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests and Cox Proportional Hazards Models were used to compare time to non-persistence. Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) were calculated using a robust variance Poisson model adjusting for covariates. A two-sided alpha level of 0.05 determined statistical significance.\\n\\nResults: The sample was (75.8%) female with mean age 45.4 ± 12.1 years. A total of 112 patients (24.9%) became non-persistent, with an adverse event (n=37) as the most common cause. No significant difference was observed in time to overall non-persistency between IFN beta-1a and dimethyl fumarate patients. Treatment-naïve patients on IFN beta-1a were 59% less likely (HR=0.410, 95% CI 0.169-0.993, p=0.0483) to experience a discontinuation (no switching or restart) compared with patients on dimethyl fumarate. Non-persistent patients on dimethyl fumarate were 5 times more likely (HR = 5.003, 95% CI 1.996-12.54, p=0.0006) to have experienced an adverse event at a given time point. No significant difference in time to relapse or ARR between IFN beta-1a and dimethyl fumarate treated patients were observed.\\n\\nConclusion: In this real world observational study, IFN beta-1a treated patients had comparable or more favorable persistency, adverse events, and relapse outcomes than dimethyl fumarate treated patients across two years.\\n\\nLB212\\n\\nTotal hip and knee arthroplasty in multiple sclerosis patients: the NYU experience\\n\\nDr. Josef M Gutman , Dr. Ilya Kister and Dr. Ran Schwarzkopf, New York University, New York, NY\\n\\nCategory: Rehabilitation and Comprehensive Care\\n\\nBackground: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients may need joint replacement surgery due to MS-related factors, such as falls or avascular necrosis, or for unrelated indications (eg primary/secondary osteoarthritis). Literature on outcomes of total joint replacement in MS patients is limited to case reports that highlight surgical complications or unusual presentations. There are no systematic reviews of indications for and short and long term outcomes of hip and knee arthroplasty in MS patients.\\n\\nObjectives: To investigate indications for and outcomes of total hip and knee arthroplasty in patients with MS.\\n\\nMethods: Retrospective chart review of NYU MS Center patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty after MS onset.\\n\\nResults: 13 MS patients followed at NYU MS Care Center underwent hip (N=8) or knee (N=5) replacement at NYU. Average age at surgery was 56±11 years (range 35-69 years) and disease duration was 16±9 years; 10/13 were female. 3 patients had prior joint trauma and 1 had avascular necrosis of the hip presumably from steroid use; the remainder suffered from osteoarthritis. Ambulatory status before surgery was: 4 - walking unassisted, 7 - cane, 2 – bilateral assistance. Ambulatory status after surgery at last follow up was: 8 walking unassisted, 3 using a cane, and 2 using a walker. Perioperative complications included acute blood loss in 4, pneumonia in 2, DVT in 1, and urinary retention in 1. Reoperation was required in 1 patient for recurrent hip dislocation.\\n\\nConclusion: Orthopedic literature focuses on perioperative complications after total joint arthroplasty in MS patients, but our data on unselected patients show that the surgery appears to benefit most of them, though (mostly non-neurologic) complications were seen in approximately half of the cases. These data can help optimize selection and surgical management of MS patients who may require total joint replacement. We intend to present additional data on our patients that will include patient-reported outcomes.',\n",
       " \"How a candidate of Romney's pedigree could cut such an unsympathetic figure has become a minor obsession in the media. Explanations range from his association with the corporate one percent to his willingness to contradict himself on key issues. All these are true, but the underlying dynamic governing our reaction to his controversial affiliations and positions is a completely natural psychological response to competing stimuli -- one that's best summed up with a technological metaphor.\\n\\nIn robotics, researchers have observed that as an object acquires human-like properties, people respond to the object with more positive feelings. The less anthropomorphized an object, the less empathy. What's cognitively demanding about this formulation is that engineers are beginning to create robots that approximate human behavior so closely that the mind interprets the robot in human terms even if the machine lacks distinguishing anthropomorphic features, like a face. The result is an unsettling feeling that borders on anxiety or revulsion. When a robot inspires such emotions, it's said to have fallen into the uncanny valley of a conceptual graph that charts fluctuations in our empathetic capacity. The graph in question looks something like this:\\n\\nOn one end of the graph, objects that look nothing like humans elicit a minimum of empathy. On the other end are real humans, with whom we identify most. In between are things that resemble humans to some degree and earn some measure of recognition for it. In the case of objects falling into the uncanny valley, the recognition can actually be negative. They recall humanity, inviting us to empathize as we might with a real human, but imperfections in the illusion create a kind of dissonance that makes us uncomfortable.\\n\\nRomney's problem is that he occupies a kind of uncanny valley for politicians. Just as people who interact with lifelike robots often develop a strange feeling due to something they can't quite name, something about Romney leaves voters unsettled.\\n\\nAs with the robotic version of the uncanny valley, the closer Romney gets to becoming real to a voter, the more his likeability declines. On television and at a distance, the former governor radiates presidential qualities from every patrician pore. The effect is almost involuntary, considering the substantial advantages Romney enjoys from appearance alone. But in person, his polished persona gives way to what appears a surprisingly forced and inauthentic character. What's disturbing about episodes like those detailed in this story isn't that they happen -- it's that they're inexplicably happening to a man who should, by the looks of him, navigate the political waters with ease.\\n\\nMost politicians tend to be ordinary-looking people who spend their time convincing voters they're office-quality material. Romney is rushing the other way: he's the politician from central casting who is stumbling through an audition for a role of regular human. Not that other candidates don't make mistakes -- they do, all the time -- but in Romney's case awkward moments stand out like neon road signs precisely because we expect him to make the jump from TV to reality as effortlessly and convincingly as his polished appearance would imply.\\n\\nRomney's task now is to work his way out of the uncanny valley toward a more compelling style of humanity.

       " 'A day of pageantry to open the 115th Congress and usher in a new period of Republican governance was overtaken Tuesday by an embarrassing reversal on ethics oversight, with the GOP gripped by internal division and many lawmakers seeking to shield themselves from extensive scrutiny.\\n\\nThe 19 hours of tumult was set in motion the night before behind closed doors at the Longworth House Office Building, where Republican lawmakers decided over the objections of Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to amend House rules to effectively gut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics.\\n\\nThey awoke Tuesday to an intense public outcry. Social media lit up with criticism of representatives trying to rein in the ethics office created a decade ago in the aftermath of scandals. Angry constituents inundated their representatives’ offices with calls of protest. Journalists peppered lawmakers with questions. The halls of the Capitol felt chaotic.\\n\\nThen, shortly after 10 a.m., came the loudest objection of all: A pair of tweets from President-elect Donald Trump scolding Congress for making the weakening of the ethics watchdog its “number one act and priority.” He punctuated his second tweet with the hashtag “DTS” — shorthand for “drain the swamp,” one of his campaign-trail mantras.\\n\\nWith Washington’s latest power dynamics in their nascent state, Tuesday’s events illustrated the weight of Trump’s voice in discussions on Capitol Hill. The president-elect’s tweets hovered over everything and helped turn what might otherwise have been an insider-driven rule change into a national ruckus over government ethics.\\n\\n(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\\n\\n[House Republicans vote to rein in independent ethics office]\\n\\nThe events were fast-moving Tuesday morning. As Trump was using his political capital on Congress, Republican House leaders were meeting in Ryan’s office contemplating just how the day had gotten away from them — and what they might do to salvage it. Ryan would soon be sworn in for another term as speaker, and his wife and children, dressed up for the occasion, lingered outside.\\n\\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told the leaders that the rules legislation with the ethics amendment would have trouble getting the 218 votes needed to pass — and they decided it must be scrapped.\\n\\nThe leaders called an emergency meeting of Republican House members in the Capitol basement. McCarthy pointedly asked the members whether they had campaigned last fall on decimating the ethics office — or on repealing President Obama’s health-care law and changing the tax code.\\n\\nThe windowless room fell silent, according to several lawmakers in attendance. McCarthy gave them an ultimatum: Reverse course now, among fellow Republicans, or take a public floor vote. He asked for unanimous consent to remove the rules change — and shortly after noon, he got it. The push to amend ethics rules was now dead, or at least fast asleep.\\n\\n“I can tell you the calls we’ve gotten in my district office and here in Washington surprised me, meaning the numbers of calls. People are just sick and tired,” Rep. Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.) said of the simmering outrage over the proposed change. “People are just losing confidence in the lack of ethics and honesty in Washington.”\\n\\nFor the lawmakers who had supported the rules change, the OCE had become an unaccountable office with little transparency. Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.), who was the subject of an OCE referral over a 2011 trip he took with his wife to Taiwan, likened the office to Old English royal courts that dictated harsh and arbitrary sentences to powerful figures.\\n\\n1 of 17 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Congress convenes for opening session of 2017 View Photos The 115th Congress was gaveled into session.

Matt McClain/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\\n\\n“It’s a star chamber,” said Roskam, who was cleared by the Ethics Committee in 2013. “It needs to be reformed.”\\n\\nHouse Republicans have not abandoned an OCE overhaul entirely, but any changes are being put off until later in the year.\\n\\nTuesday’s actions disrupted a day of ceremonial rituals, as Ryan was easily reelected as speaker with the support of all but one Republican — far fewer defectors than when he first won the speakership in 2015. Most Democrats voted for Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who will remain the minority leader.\\n\\nMembers of the new House and Senate were sworn in throughout the afternoon. Republicans will hold a 52-48 advantage over Democrats in the Senate, and 241-194 in the House.\\n\\nDelivering his inaugural floor speech as Senate minority leader, Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) vowed to fight Trump on issues where Democrats disagree.\\n\\n“It is not our job to be a rubber stamp,” Schumer said. “It is our job to do what’s best for the American people, the middle class and those struggling to get there.”\\n\\nBut in a sign of his party’s diminished influence, Schumer spoke to a mostly empty chamber save for several dozen of his Democratic colleagues. Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) stood on the floor whispering to each other, ignoring Schumer.\\n\\n[Here are the eight Trump Cabinet picks Democrats plan to target]\\n\\nThe House rules package that ultimately passed Tuesday contained a controversial provision that will impose fines on members using electronic devices to take photographs, record audio or video or conduct live streams on the House floor. The provision came in response to House Democrats staging a sit-in last summer aimed at forcing votes on gun control legislation.\\n\\nAt issue earlier in the day were changes to the Office of Congressional Ethics, which was created in 2008 following the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal to address concerns that members of the House Ethics Committee had been too timid in pursuing allegations of wrongdoing by fellow lawmakers.\\n\\nThe amendment, proposed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), would have renamed the office as the Office of Congressional Complaint Review and prevented it from investigating anonymous tips or referring criminal wrongdoing to prosecutors without the express consent of the Ethics Committee. It also would have prohibited the office from employing staff to communicate with the public or the media.\\n\\nHouse leaders knew days in advance of Monday night’s meeting of Republican lawmakers to finalize the House rules package that Goodlatte would seek to undermine the independent ethics office.\\n\\nThe leadership made an effort to head off the proposal before the meeting, but Goodlatte refused to budge.\\n\\nAs the meeting started at 5:30 p.m., aides were confident that members would reject Goodlatte’s proposal once Ryan and McCarthy weighed in against it. That did not happen. Goodlatte was backed by a chorus of rank-and-file lawmakers — many of whom had been targeted by OCE probes or feared they might be next — who were emboldened to make changes. The measure passed handily, 119 to 74. Dozens of other members were absent because they were not yet in Washington.\\n\\nRep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) echoed the views of many colleagues in saying changes to the OCE were long overdue. “There’s no due process,” he said. “An anonymous source can destroy your life, put you on the front page of the newspaper — and when it’s too late, you’re completely exonerated. I’ve watched that happen to close friends who were straight as an arrow.”\\n\\n[Donald Trump, meet your toughest hurdle: the U.S. Senate]\\n\\nOthers foresaw the political toll that could be exacted for a decision to make gutting ethics oversight the first act of the new Congress. “I had cautioned some of my colleagues last night that that one provision would create quite a public stir — and it did,” Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) said with a slight chuckle.\\n\\nRyan and McCarthy initially seemed resigned to accepting the will of their members, even though they understood the less-than-optimal message it sent to voters nationally, especially following an campaign during which Washington was vilified.\\n\\nBefore GOP members could meet to change course, McCarthy had to face a conference room full of skeptical reporters. “We’re a collective group of individuals,” he said. “Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.”\\n\\nThe development blindsided Trump transition officials, prompting Ryan staffers to explain to Trump aides late Monday night and into Tuesday morning what exactly House members had voted on and why they did it.\\n\\nEarly Tuesday, one of Trump’s top advisers, Kellyanne Conway, partially defended the proposed changes to the ethics office in an appearance on MSNBC. But that was before she discussed the matter with the president-elect, and a few hours later it became clear he disagreed with what House Republicans had done.\\n\\n“With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it . . . may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, health care and so many other things of far greater importance!” Trump wrote on Twitter Tuesday morning.\\n\\nTrump spokesman Sean Spicer said the president-elect was not taking a position on the merits of the ethics rules changes, only on the prioritization.\\n\\n“It’s not a question of strengthening or weakening,” Spicer told reporters. “I think it’s a question of priorities and the president’s belief that with all that this country wants and needs to have happen, this really shouldn’t be the priority.”\\n\\nRyan and Trump eventually spoke by phone following the conference meeting and during the vote for speaker, per aides.\\n\\nBut earlier, as Trump was firing off tweets, McCarthy reflected on the discord that had engulfed Congress’s first day. During the morning news conference, McCarthy was flung questions from journalists — including one about whether the day’s events signaled weakness on the part of House leaders.\\n\\n“Man,” McCarthy replied, “welcome back.”\\n\\nRead more at PowerPost\\n\\nSean Sullivan, Paul Kane, Ed O’Keefe, David Weigel, Kelsey Snell, Scott Higham and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.',\n",

       " 'Eric Lindros\\n\\nIn March 2000, Eric Lindros suffered his second concussion of the season, the fourth of his career, and criticised team trainers for letting him play through concussion symptoms weeks earlier. GM Bobby Clarke stripped Lindros of his captaincy and the hatred between the two boiled to new heights.\\n\\nLindros eventually came back for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Final against the New Jersey Devils. Many believed he was being rushed back out of desperation, as the Flyers were in the process of choking away a 3-1 series lead. In Game 7, Scott Stevens delivered what would become one of the most devastating hits of Lindros’ career, causing yet another concussion.\\n\\nStill mad over the way he was handled by the team and its trainers, Lindros was dealt a low blow in the off-season as he was only offered a two-way qualifying offer that could see the Flyers dump him in the AHL. Lindros demanded a trade to his hometown Maple Leafs and sat out the entire 2000-01 season.\\n\\nTalks between the Leafs and Flyers were contentious, mainly because Clarke didn’t actually want to make Lindros happy by trading him to his preferred destination. Miraculously, the talks progressed to a point that the Leafs and Lindros had agreed to a five-year, $45 million contract, but two separate deadline deals fell apart.\\n\\nOne deal was Nik Antropov , a few years removed from being the 10th overall pick, Dmitry Yushkevich , the Leafs’ No. 1 defeceman , and an undisclosed player.\\n\\nAnother deal was Antropov , 24-year-old defenceman Danny Markov, and a first-round pick.\\n\\nHowever, the Flyers insisted upon 22-year-old Tomas Kaberle . The Leafs refused and the Flyers ultimately dealt Lindros to the Rangers for a package of Jan Hlavac , Kim Johnsson , Pavel Brendl , and a third-round pick.\\n\\nOf course, the Leafs did eventually land Lindros for the 2005-06 season. But by that time he was a shell of his former self and was one year away from retiring. If the Leafs had made the trade with the Flyers, the 2005-06 season would be the last of Lindros ’ $45 million contract, and with a salary roll back, Toronto would be paying Lindros $6.84 million to score 22 points in 33 games.\\n\\nVincent Lecavalier\\n\\nAfter being nearly traded for Eric Lindros in 2001, Kaberle found himself involved in discussions for another No. 1 centre later that year.\\n\\nVincent Lecavalier had yet to live up the hype of being a first overall selection, and was nowhere close to fulfilling the \"Michael Jordan of hockey\" moniker that former Lightning owner Art Williams bestowed upon him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLecavalier scored 146 points in 230 games over his first three seasons, and was struggling mightily in his fourth season (he scored 37 points in 76 games). The Lightning had about enough, especially as Lecavalier and head coach John Tortorella butted heads, and were ready to deal the 21-year-old to the Toronto Maple Leafs in December 2001.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe deal was Lecavalier to Toronto in exchange for Nik Antropov, drafted nine spots behind Lecavalier in 1998, Tomas Kaberle, Jonas Hoglund, and either recently drafted Brad Boyes, or Toronto\\'s first-round pick in 2002 (Alex Steen).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to Bill Watters, Toronto\\'s assistant GM, the deal was complete. However, Tampa Bay GM Rick Dudley couldn\\'t get Lightning ownership on board and the trade was never made.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLecavalier broke out big the next season, scoring 33 goals and 78 points, the first of five consecutive seasons of 30+ goals. Lecavalier was a huge part of Tampa Bay\\'s 2004 Stanley Cup victory and also won the Rocket Richard Trophy in 2006-07.\\n\\nChris Pronger\\n\\nFollowing a storybook run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2006, the Edmonton Oilers were faced with the unsavoury task of dealing Chris Pronger , the No. 1 defenceman they had just acquired one year earlier and one of the main reasons they were within one game of hoisting the Stanley Cup.\\n\\nPronger cited personal reasons for asking out of Edmonton, and many speculated his wife was not happy living in the capital of Alberta.\\n\\nThe Leafs were coming off a year in which they narrowly missed the playoffs, thanks to the New York Islanders (of all teams), who defeated the New Jersey Devils in a shootout. That started the string of playoffless springs that Toronto still endures.\\n\\nWith Bryan McCabe about to sign a five-year contract, John Ferguson Jr. discussed bringing Pronger to Toronto. The initial offer was Kaberle , who himself just signed a fresh contract, and Matt Stajan , who scored 27 points as a 22-year-old. The Oilers insisted Alex Steen be a part of the package over Stajan , as Steen, a former first-round selection, was coming off a 45-point rookie season.\\n\\nFerguson would not part with both Kaberle and Steen, and the Oilers dealt Pronger to Anaheim for Joffrey Lupul , Ladislav Smid , and three draft picks.\\n\\nPronger helped Anaheim win their first Stanley Cup and JFJ was fired within a matter of years.\\n\\nJeff Carter\\n\\nCliff Fletcher rode into town in 2008, looking to crack skulls and move out bodies, after Leafs management mercifully cut JFJ loose years after they should have. On the docket was shipping out as many players as possible to give a clean slate, and refreshed prospect cupboard, for Brian Burke, who was heading to Toronto in the worst kept secret of all-time.\\n\\nOne of the major deals on the table for Fletcher was Jeff Carter, in the midst of what would be a 29-goal season, and a first-round pick for Tomas Kaberle . Fletcher was probably drooling at the thought, but Kaberle nixed the idea, using his no-trade clause to stick around in Toronto with the rest of his NTC-havin’ buddies.\\n\\nThe first-round pick turned into Luca Sbisa , which isn’t anything special, but at the time could have given Toronto more flexibility to make other deals.\\n\\nPhil Kessel\\n\\nHeading into his first off-season as the Leafs’ GM, Brian Burke was looking to make a splash. He targeted Phil Kessel of the Boston Bruins , who was being squeezed out of Beantown after a 36-goal season because Boston was so close to the salary cap. They were close to the cap because they signed Derek Morris to a $3.3 million contract (Morris wouldn’t even finish the season in Boston).\\n\\nThe two sides were close to a trade at the 2009 draft, but it fell apart because of a simple miscommunication. Boston GM Peter Chiarelli thought he was dealing Phil Kessel to Toronto for Tomas Kaberle and the seventh overall pick; Burke thought he was trading Kaberle for Phil Kessel and Boston’s first-round pick. Whoops.\\n\\nToronto drafted Nazem Kadri seventh overall and the Bruins took Jordan Caron 25th overall.\\n\\nIf Burke had agreed to the initial “offer”, he could have had Kessel for Kaberle and Kadri . So instead of Kessel, Kadri , Joe Colborne and Tyler Biggs, the Leafs would have Kessel, Tyler Seguin, and Dougie Hamilton. Are you sufficiently sad yet?\\n\\nBurke must have erroneously believed the Leafs would improve substantially with Kessel, thus any picks he was dealing would have been expected to be higher than seventh. In addition, he must have believed he could get a first-round pick, plus a top prospect (first-round quality) for Kaberle (which he did). So, at the time, dealing Kaberle and the seventh overall pick must have looked liked three first-round picks to Burke, so two firsts and a second (which he probably thought would be closer to mid-round than lottery) would sound like an “underpayment”. But even with mental gymnastics, knowing who Toronto eventually gave up, it’s almost impossible to say Burke didn’t severely overpay.\\n\\nTo recap: Tomas Kaberle was almost dealt in five major deals; three times for a No. 1 centre, once for a No. 1 defenceman, and once for a No. 1 winger (with the added benefit of keeping a No. 1 centre in Toronto). For various reasons, none ever came to fruition and Leafs fans instead cling to faint hope that the package they did receive can someday erase the ghosts of the past.\\n\\nNot so long ago, Tomas Kaberle was the only bright light during increasingly dark times in Toronto.With the Leafs attempting to rebuild, Kaberle\\'s name was linked in just about every trade rumour imaginable. Finally, after what seemed like years of endless rumours, Kaberle was dealt to the Boston Bruins for Joe Colborne, a first-round pick, and a conditional second-round pick, which eventually went to Toronto after Boston won the 2011 Stanley Cup.However, Kaberle has been involved in trade talks long before Brian Burke struggled to bring respectability back to Toronto. Here are five major trades that would have seen Tomas Kaberle packing his bags and the history of the Toronto Maple Leafs change dramatically.Carter broke out huge the next season, scoring a career-high 46 goals and 84 points.Especially with Mats Sundin leaving after the season, Carter was, and still is, the No. 1 centre the Leafs desperately needed.When the two men realized the deal they thought they were getting wasn’t actually offered, the trade fell apart.With the threat of an offer sheet looming (which would have cost Toronto a first, second, and third-round pick), the two sides finally struck a deal a few months later. Toronto sent two first-round picks, which turned out to be the second and ninth overall, plus a second-round pick, for Kessel.',\n",

       " 'Several members of the Hmong community said they\\'re living in fear, after two traumatic incidents right here in northcentral Wisconsin.\\n\\nOne Hmong family in Junction City has now relocated fearing their safety.

When arrested, the 80-year-old Junction City man, Henry Kaminski, told an officer he felt there were too many Hmong people in the area.\\n\\nNow, Democratic Representative Katrina Shankland is speaking out, asking residents to treat the Hmong community with respect. This comes not only after the Junction City incident, but also after she received an anonymous letter this week asking to \"deport all Hmong\\'s.\\'\\'\\n\\nThe letter caused fear for some Hmong residents in Portage County. People like Chai Moua of the Hmong American Association.\\n\\n\"It really sunk into me that if there was one person who could think this way, and can come out like this,\" Moua said. \"How many more are waiting to cause harm?

       " 'ORLANDO, Fla. (August 10, 2017) - Orlando Pride midfielder Maddy Evans has announced her retirement from professional soccer. The five-year National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) veteran will play her final match on Saturday, Aug. 12, at Orlando City Stadium when the Pride host Sky Blue FC.\\n\\n“My decision to walk away happened very fast but I’ve accepted a job back home in Pennsylvania. It wasn’t an easy decision but, for me professionally and big picture, it’s the perfect fit and best option at this time,” Evans said. “I want to thank all of Orlando City, especially my teammates, the fans and the entire organization for providing me a chance to really feel what it means to be a professional soccer player. These two years have been an experience I’ll always remember.”\\n\\n“It’s with very mixed feelings that we see Maddy go. The first is obviously sadness that we are losing a player with such influence on the team, both on and off the field, and with such a great relationship with our supporters. Maddy has been an unbelievable team character, irreplaceable in that sense. So it’s with a lot of sadness we say goodbye,” Head Coach Tom Sermanni said. “But, at the same time, it’s exciting for her to look at this opportunity that’s cropped up. Having five years as a professional in the league, she feels the time is right to move to the next stage in her life and career and we share her excitement for that. We wish her every success for the future.”\\n\\nEvans, 26, was acquired with the Pride’s No. 9 pick in the 2015 NWSL Expansion Draft after three seasons with the Boston Breakers. The midfielder has appeared in 27 matches for Orlando, making 16 starts. On Sept. 7, 2016, Evans set up Alex Morgan’s go-ahead goal at Sky Blue FC with a perfectly placed chip over the backline.\\n\\nPrior to her move to Central Florida, Evans was a staple of the Boston Breakers midfield, totaling 2,250 minutes over 46 appearances with the club. Evans scored two goals and added three assists with the Breakers.\\n\\nA graduate of Penn State University, Evans also played for Brisbane Roar in Australia’s Westfield W-League during the 2016-17 season.',\n",
       " '(Image: Paper people via Shutterstock)\\n\\nDo you support Truthout’s reporting and analysis? Click here to help us continue doing this work!\\n\\nFacts matter. The wealthiest 1% of the US population possesses 34.6 percent of wealth. The top 1% to 10% owns another 38.5 percent of the wealth. This means that the wealthiest 10% control 73.1 percent of American wealth. How much does this leave for the other 90%? Just 26.9 percent. For perspective, imagine you’re at a dinner party with 9 other people, and the host is about to serve a delicious chocolate cake. He cuts it into 10 equal slices, puts one piece onto a plate and invites you and the other 8 guests to divvy it up. Meanwhile he settles down for a belly-aching good time with the other nine slices. That’s how wealth is distributed in this nation: Damn near the whole cake goes to the people in the multi-million-dollar suites or mansions, but for one slice, which the rest of us battle each other for.\\n\\nThe 2011 documentary, Park Avenue, is an example of a film that expertly details the facts of US economic distribution, the way lobbyists and wealthy donors influence policies that affect this distribution and the consequences all of this has for the poor. Yet such films do not meaningfully discuss fundamental ethical concepts such as “moral equality,” “moral status” and “justice.” Instead these ideas are addressed indirectly, often by pulling on religious heartstrings. In Park Avenue, a protestor reproaches Republican Paul Ryan for adopting Ayn Rand’s egoistic economic policy and failing to heed Jesus’ dictate to help the poor. Michael Moore pulls similar religiously motivated heartstrings in Capitalism: A Love Story, offering up religious leaders as spokespersons for morality. Otherwise, such films assume that abstract concepts such as moral equality, dignity and justice are so basic and/or obvious that they don’t merit explicit explanation and discussion, or are simply beyond the film’s parameters. But these ideas are no longer (and perhaps never were, in fact) basic to the American worldview, and it’s time we inspire a real discussion of the just and fair society. We need to do a better job of knowing and discussing fundamental ethical concepts such as “moral equality” and a better job of explaining the moral meanings of the facts.\\n\\nMoral Equality\\n\\nLet’s start with “moral equality” a concept so fundamental to the ideals of the United States of America that it’s enshrined in the Declaration of Independence:\\n\\n“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men [sic] are created equal. That they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men [sic].”\\n\\nObscured by the spectacle of fireworks and patriotic sloganeering that increasingly define the holiday, such talk is strikingly absent from mainstream celebrations of Independence Day. Yet this pivotal document in American history provides a clear moral assertion that “all men” – which we now understand to include all people – are equal in fundamental human worth.\\n\\nThis ethical concept, however basic to American history, is increasingly misunderstood and disavowed. Some contend that the principle of equality creates an unnatural, unjustifiable equality between superiors and inferiors. Isn’t it obvious, some plead, that the medical doctor is not equal in worth to the bus driver, and that the business entrepreneur is superior to the Walmart cashier? The very fact that the doctor and the entrepreneur are successful, many argue, proves they are not equal! Implied in such thinking is this background belief: Our value as people is based upon having a certain amount of education, financial power or mastery of socially exalted talents or skills. Those without these qualities are regarded as being less valuable and, therefore, unequal.\\n\\nThis line of thinking confuses equality of moral worth with equality of social talent or success. Sure, the medical doctor’s knowledge of treating sickness is probably better than the bus driver’s. (Never mind that the bus driver is likely better at driving buses than is the physician!). This is where we should do a better job of saying, “So what’s your point?” For the fact that a medical doctor is better at practicing medicine than a bus driver does not necessarily mean the doctor’s life counts for more than the bus driver’s life. No one is denying that, for example, a bus driver and medical doctor’s knowledge or skill in the field of medicine is unequal. But such discussions of equality have to do with equality in talent not “moral equality” or equality in overall moral status.\\n\\nDefining Dignity\\n\\nTo have moral status or dignity is to be inherently valuable. Lewis Vaughn writes: “A being with moral status is of moral importance regardless of whether it is a means to something else, and in our dealings with it we must somehow take this fact into account.” Those without moral status are excluded from the circle of moral concern: Thus we can eat them, wear them, break them, cut them, and, put simply, use them anyway we like. Theirs is a purely “instrumental” value.\\n\\nPerhaps this just brings us back to square one, with the “moral equality” skeptic asking: “so what entitles something or someone to the claim of moral status or dignity?” Throughout history, ruling elites have attempted to rationalize denying moral status to others on the basis of their lacking the possession of “necessary” qualities such as specified intelligence, cultural or familial origins, race-ethnicity, religious identification, sexual orientation, class-economic standing, sex/gender, and political affiliation among others. Most contemporary moral philosophers see these assertions as disguises masking self-centered prejudice. Philosopher Anthony Weston writes:\\n\\n“There was a time when moral concern only went as far as the walls of a man’s city. Indeed, it didn’t even go that far, as women, children, slaves and non-property-owning males within the walls didn’t count either. Gradually some of these others came to be recognized as moral equals, but each step was a fight. The abolition of slavery took centuries. [And illegal slavery still exists around the world.] Deeply rooted forms of racism and sexism still persist. So does suspicion of outsiders – those not of ‘our’ race or nation or culture – and the willingness to abandon them to whatever misery fate may impose on them.”\\n\\nMoral status or dignity is not tied to a narrow quality or capacity such as medical, mathematical or linguistic knowledge. The 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant provides one of the most respected articulations of the conditions for moral status or dignity (i.e. inner-worth). This status is deserved by all people. But Kant doesn’t mean the biological category – human. By person he means beings who are self-aware, capable of reasoning and making free choices, and, consequently, responsible for one’s actions. Kant asserted that these are the qualities that distinguish those things in the world that are deserving of basic respect from those that are not. What makes an action right is that it treats people as ends in themselves and not merely as means to another’s desired end. As Kant states in his “respect for persons” principle, morality requires that we “Act in such a way that you always treat humanity . . . never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.” Actions that objectify, manipulate or otherwise use people against their will are immoral because they conflict with the basic recognition of the freedom and dignity of the person.\\n\\nContemporary philosopher Peter Singer offers a more inclusive theory of moral status that exchanges the emphasis on “reasoning” for one emphasizing “sentience” and the basic condition of having “interests.” This includes: “Avoiding pain, developing one’s abilities, satisfying basic needs for food and shelter, enjoying warm personal relationships, freedom to pursue projects without interference.” If we openly and impartially reflect on the question, Singer theorizes, we will recognize that whatever differences we have in terms of our intellectual and/or physical competencies, career paths, economic standing, sexual orientation, race-ethnicity and so on, nearly all humans (and other species as well) share a basic desire for a good life. Our fundamentally shared interests for a good life is what entitles us to moral concern or respect and requires each of us to equally consider the well-being of others in our ethical deliberations.\\n\\nOne way to assess our ideas about what entitles us to moral status – dignity, inherent worth – is to answer these questions: How would you feel if a teacher viciously stomped on an eraser? What if the eraser was made in America or was white rather than black? What if the eraser cried out in pain and was trying to get away? To the extent that it is absurd to suggest our concern for the eraser would increase if we discovered its “color” or “nationality,” it’s clear these are irrelevant to moral status. But it might well be an indication of our humanity to be shocked or disturbed by an eraser crying out in pain as it was thrown across a room. And our reaction would suggest that the capacity to suffer earns something moral status or consideration.\\n\\nPutting this into context, when morally-motivated critics decry multi-million-dollar companies’ paying workers minimum wage pay on grounds it is unfair, they aren’t saying that people working as cashiers necessarily have an equal talent for business as the CEO. What they’re asserting is that the cashier’s life is no more or less fundamentally valuable than the CEO’s, and that her basic well-being, insofar as it is immediately affected by her job (pay, on-the-job treatment, etc.) ought to be as much a factor in budgetary considerations of a thriving business – that she is contributing her labor to – as the CEO’s.\\n\\n(Reminding the Powerful of) The Perils of Disavowing Dignity\\n\\nAll of this brings us back to the initial reply by critics of the concept of moral equality: “So what.” When others reject basic humane principles such as the moral status of persons or those with interests, the conversation may well be over. But before we abandon dialogue with our ideological opponents, it’s worth reminding the self-titled superiors of the perils of disavowing universal dignity for persons.\\n\\nMany believe that talk of moral equality is nonsense and that it is obvious that being more talented in some field or another means that one is not simply superior in talent, but also superior in overall worth. Imagine, Janis rejects the notion that she and Sherry are morally equal because Sherry is less competent in mathematics, for instance. But this “presumption of superiority,” as I call it, is fallacious. As Singer explains, “Racists who maintain [that equal status depends on intelligence] are in peril of being forced to kneel before the next genius they encounter.” This much was clear to US founders such as Thomas Jefferson, who explained that moral equality is not based on “talent.” He wrote, “Because Sir Isaac Newton was superior to others in understanding, he was not therefore lord of the property or persons of others.”\\n\\nThere are other reasons the rejection of moral equality via the presumption of superiority is doomed. Even if it were true that some individual or group of individuals were, on average, superior to another in a particular aptitude, this would tell us nothing about the value we should place on such aptitudes. Despite dominant culture’s attempts to pretend it is thoroughly value-neutral, proclamations about the significance of assorted characteristics and skills are statements of value. When someone asserts that Janis deserves greater moral consideration than Sherry because she is superior in mathematics or engineering or linguistics skills, the unstated presumption is that aptitude in these fields corresponds to an elevation in moral worth. The same is true when it’s assumed that someone skilled in engineering is entitled to greater moral consideration than someone skilled in child care, dance, music or painting. But why should we accept any of these assertions? Why does superiority of skill in some culturally exalted intelligence or practice entitle one to superiority of moral consideration? Why should we accept the “commonsense” belief that if you’re a “low-skill” fast-food worker, for instance, you don’t deserve to be paid a “living wage”? Simply put, we shouldn’t. They are just the latest versions of an irrational, inhumane and self-centered ideology seeking to obscure the moral equality we all deserve and can understand.\\n\\nMore than Facts: Fundamental Ethical Ideas/Theory of Value\\n\\nFacts are essential, but they are not sufficient to understand or address issues of income-inequality. Facts are rather meaningless without applying relevant theories or concepts of value. This is where ethics, the philosophical study of moral values, comes in. Sure the wealthy have chocolate cake coming out of their eye-sockets while the rest of us are fighting each other to lick the plate. But the reply many offer is a simple: “So what?” or “That’s just how it is.” How do we respond? “It’s not fair!” To which many reply, “Life isn’t fair.” But what do we even mean by the words “fair” and “inequality”? Advocates for social justice, be they journalists, activists, students, parents, social workers and the like, need to do more than know and state the facts. We need to embrace and participate in the creative discussion of moral theory and values and how they should shape our understanding of the facts.',\n",
       " 'Massimo Cellino has been barred as Leeds United owner by the Football League and will not be permitted to exercise control at the Championship club for almost three months, after the Italian’s appeal against his disqualification was rejected.\\n\\nCellino was initially disqualified in December when the League ruled a first-grade conviction for tax evasion on a yacht in Sardinia was a “dishonest offence” and that he was therefore in breach of the organisation’s owners’ and directors’ test. The 58-year-old had his appeal against the decision rejected by a professional conduct committee including the League chairman, Greg Clarke, on Monday.\\n\\nIt means Cellino, whose company Eleonora Sport purchased a 75% stake in Leeds last April, will have to step down as a club director by Wednesday and show that he is not acting as a “relevant person” until 10 April, a period of 79 days. His first-grade conviction for tax evasion on his yacht, the Nelie, becomes spent in the British legal system on 28 March – 12 months after the original ruling in Italy – following a recent change to the Rehabilitation of Offenders’ Act.\\n\\nLeeds’ chief operating officer, Matthew Child, confirmed the club would be as compliant “as they needed to be” with the ruling but could not comment on who would be running the club in Cellino’s absence. “I can’t at this stage,” Child told BBC Radio Leeds. “We’ve a few more discussions to have. There are lots of priorities at the moment and that’s one of them, but probably not the top one at this moment in time, very close, but not the top. We need to sit down with the president, the Italian counsel, the British counsel, myself and another couple of guys. It’s very early days for us yet. As with anything to do with Leeds United, it’s never straightforward is it?”\\n\\n“We are surprised and really disappointed. We will continue to take legal advice and we are working round the clock, as we have been for a period of time, to see what our options are because this is uncharted territory for all of us.”\\n\\nHe added: “We don’t know what the implications are. We’re going to be as compliant as we need to be. We’re in constant discussions with the Football League and our own board and senior management team, we’re not sure.”\\n\\nTim Kerr, the independent QC who chaired the professional conduct committee, dismissed the legal arguments made by Cellino’s lawyers, and one from the club director Andrew Umbers that claimed there was “a real likelihood of insolvency” should Cellino be disqualified.\\n\\nThe League ruled that judge Sandra Lepore’s full written judgment of the tax case clearly showed that the Italian had acted dishonestly when failing to pay import tax. As revealed by the Guardian last September, Lepore described Cellino’s “elusive intent” and a “bogus corporate scheme” relating to the case in 2012, when he failed to pay nearly €390,000 (£300,000) import duty on the yacht.\\n\\nA League spokesman said: “The Football League’s sole objective throughout this process has been to ensure that our regulations, as democratically approved by our member clubs, are complied with. These regulations uphold principles relating to club ownership that are widely recognised to be in the interests of the game and have the support of the other football authorities, the government and football supporters generally.” among supporters, with the team struggling in the Championship this season and perilously close to the relegation zone, sacking three managers since his arrival.Cellino has been heavily involved in all club matters at Leeds since he first bought the club last year. He has divided opinion\\n\\nIt is unclear who will run the club in his absence. Cellino has two sons on the board at Leeds, as well as his American financial adviser, Daniel Arty, although during the PCC hearing a lawyer for the League stated “family members would not necessarily have to divest themselves of their stakes in the club”. The former owners and investment bank, Gulf Finance House Capital, remain 25% shareholders in the club, while Child added: “Massimo feels like he has been invited to a party and, when he has shown up, he hasn’t been allowed in.”\\n\\nCellino has two more import tax cases to be heard in Italy this year, on a Range Rover and a second yacht called Lucky 23, while Leeds are under a transfer embargo for the January window after breaching financial fair play regulations when owned by GFHC.\\n\\nA statement from the League added: “A further misconduct charge against Mr Cellino and the club for failing to supply the Italian court judgment to the Football League when it first became available will be heard by a Football Disciplinary Commission in line with League regulations in due course.”',\n",
       " 'How Looper Works\\n\\nFirst off, go see Looper. One of the best movies I’ve seen. Spoilers follow.\\n\\nOK, let’s start by explaining how a looper’s career is supposed to look. You get hired as a looper, spend your time sitting in a corn field shooting people, eventually shoot yourself and get a big payday, live off of it for thirty more years, then get kidnapped and sent back in time and shot by yourself. Notice that this is a stable timeloop: young you grows old, goes back in time, gets shot by young you, who grows old, goes back in time, gets shot by young you, who grows old … etc.\\n\\nBut time travel doesn’t eliminate free will. We see this with the case of Seth (Paul Dano / Frank Brennan). Instead of shooting Old Seth, Young Seth decides to let him escape. This too is a stable timeloop: young Seth grows old, goes back in time, escapes, lives in hiding while young Seth grows old, goes back in time, escapes, lives in hiding while … .\\n\\nBut other characters have free will too: young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) decides to give young Seth up. The gang cuts off one of young Seth’s fingers, pushing him into a new timeloop: young Seth gets caught, loses one of his fingers, goes back in time, escapes, while young Seth gets caught, loses one of his fingers, goes back in time, escapes, etc. With each new choice by the gang to let old Seth change young Seth’s future (and thus old Seth’s past), we head into a new timeloop, where old Seth has a different past (and thus different memories and different missing limbs).\\n\\nIn the first main timeloop (shown second in the movie, via a flashback), young Joe shoots old Joe, goes to China, becomes an unusually-talented agent of violence, finds true love, is kidnapped and sent back in time, and gets killed by young Joe, who goes on to do the same thing. This too is a nice stable timeloop.\\n\\nBut on one of these runs through the loop, old Joe manages to overpower the guards and, while he does go back in time, he manages to keep young Joe from killing him. He escapes into the field, finds the location of young Cid, then comes back to shoot Cid’s mother while Cid escapes into field and stows away on a train. Cid grows up to be the Rainmaker and Joe grows old. Cid’s henchmen murder old Joe’s wife but are overpowered by old Joe, who goes back in time to try again to kill Cid, who again escapes to become the Rainmaker and kill Joe’s wife. This too is a stable timeloop, although we see some of it only in speculative flash-forwards (I’ll explain why in a moment).\\n\\nWhich timeloop are we watching? Well, we’re watching the story of a particular instance of Joe, who we’ll call Movie Joe. Movie Joe only exists, however, because of a choice made by Flashback Joe (the Joe we see in the flashback that begins when Movie Joe is falling from his apartment). Flashback Joe is born, grows up, decides to give up Seth, closes his own loop, grows old, overpowers the henchmen, goes back in time, knocks out Movie Joe, hunts down Cid, and is about to kill Cid’s mother.\\n\\nBut Flashback Joe is not the protagonist of the film. The protagonist is Movie Joe. Movie Joe is born, grows up, decides to give up Seth, fails to close his loop, goes to protect Cid. Normally, young Joe fails and heads into a timeloop where Cid stows away on the train and becomes the Rainmaker. But Movie Joe somehow is able to foresee this future and concludes the only way to prevent it is to kill himself. Since he dies there, he never grows old and never goes back in time, leading to a timeline where Flashback Joe doesn’t ever exist. Note, this is not a stable timeloop (because Movie Joe only kills himself to stop Flashback Joe, who can’t exist if Movie Joe kills himself) but instead just a garden-variety timeline. In this timeline, presumably, Sarah keeps Cid from growing evil and everything ends happily ever after.\\n\\nNext week we’ll explain Primer.\\n\\nYou should follow me on twitter here.\\n\\nOctober 8, 2012',\n",
       " 'This article is about the book series. For the TV series based on the books, see Wayside (TV series)\\n\\nWayside School is a series of dark comedy, short story cycle, children\\'s novels written by Louis Sachar, consisting of: Sideways Stories from Wayside School (1978), Wayside School is Falling Down (1989), and Wayside School Gets A Little Stranger (1995). The books tell the stories of a school built 30 floors high, with one classroom on each floor, but without a 19th floor. Each book contains 30 chapters.\\n\\nIn 1989, Sachar released two spinoff books of mathematics and puzzles interspersed with stories: Sideways Arithmetic from Wayside School and More Sideways Arithmetic from Wayside School. In 2005, a television special loosely based on the books titled Wayside: The Movie aired, and was followed-up in 2007 by a Wayside animated series.\\n\\nBackground [ edit ]\\n\\nWhile a student at University of California, Berkeley, author Louis Sachar began working at an elementary school to earn college credit.[1] Sachar later recalled,\\n\\n“ I thought it over and decided it was a pretty good deal. College credits, no homework, no term papers, no tests, all I had to do was help out in a second/third grade class at Hillside Elementary School in Berkeley, California. Besides helping out in a classroom, I also became the Noontime Supervisor, or \"Louis the Yard Teacher\" as I was known to the kids. It became my favorite college class, and a life changing experience.[1] ”\\n\\nSachar graduated from UC Berkeley in 1976 with a degree in Economics, and began working on Sideways Stories From Wayside School, a children\\'s book set at an elementary school with supernatural elements. Although the book\\'s students were named after children from Hillside and there is a presumably autobiographical character named \"Louis the Yard Teacher,\"[1] Sachar has said that he draws very little from personal experience, explaining that \"....my personal experiences are kind of boring. I have to make up what I put in my books.\"[2]\\n\\nCharacters [ edit ]\\n\\nThe Wayside School books take place on the thirtieth story of Wayside School, which is taught by Mrs. Jewls, a nice teacher with occasionally impractical teaching methods. She is the replacement for the old teacher, Mrs. Gorf, who was an evil teacher who could wiggle her ears and stick out her tongue to turn the students into apples. The third book introduces her son, Mr. Gorf, who could steal voices through a third nostril, alongside Mrs. Drazil, Louis\\'s old teacher who remembers students that forgot homework assignments from decades ago, and Ms. Wendy Nogard, who could read thoughts with a third ear on the top of her head.\\n\\nThe thirtieth story has had thirty students taught throughout the course of the books, such as Todd, a student who Mrs. Jewls sends home on the kindergarten bus after slight misdemeanors; Maurecia, a sweet and sensitive girl who loves ice cream; Dana, a girl with glasses who has a tendency to be over-emotional; and Myron, a trustworthy and loyal student who was class president for one day. Other students include John, who could only read upside-down until his brain got flipped; Joe, a boy with several curly hairs who can\\'t count right; Stephen, a boy who frequently shows up to class in silly outfits; Jenny, a girl who is often late to school and has to get there on a motorcycle; Bebe, a girl who can produce art very quickly, but is shown to be a bit troublesome in class; Rondi, a girl who is often recognized for the front teeth she doesn\\'t have until she gets them in the second book; and Leslie, a girl with long pigtails that are often pulled by Paul, an inattentive boy who loves pulling pigtails. There are also the Three Erics, consisting of Eric Fry, the most athletic Eric who is often called \"Butterfingers\" since the other Erics are inathletic; Eric Bacon, the skinniest Eric who is often called \"Fatso\" since the other Erics are fat; and Eric Ovens, the nicest Eric who is usually called \"Crabapple\" since the other Erics are typically pretty negative. Sharie is a girl who wears a large coat and frequently falls asleep in class, but is respected since Mrs. Jewls believes she learns best that way; Deedee is a girl who likes sports but is always stuck with the lame yellow ball, which doesn\\'t bounce and always goes the opposite way of where you kick it. Also in the books are Allison, a girl who typically tries to assert dominance, even over her friends; D.J., a boy who usually smiles, even without reason; Dameon, a boy with a crush on Mrs. Jewls who often is sent running up and down the thirty flights of stairs at Wayside; Joy, a tomboyish kleptomaniac who usually targets Todd or Dameon; Jason, a boy with a big mouth who always gets in bad situations; Kathy, a girl who is mean to all the other students; Terrence, a school bully who rarely shares and usually kicks the balls over the fence; Mac, a boy who once was named Nancy and now tells long stories in class; Ron, a boy with weak feet who loves to play kickball; and Calvin, a slow-paced student who is Bebe\\'s art assistant.\\n\\nThree new students were introduced throughout the course of the series, the first being Sammy, who first appeared in Sideways Stories from Wayside School, who was revealed to be a dead rat bundled in raincoats by the end of the chapter. The second was Sue, who only appeared in the spin-off books, a normal girl who transferred to Wayside, only to be confused by the school\\'s bizarre teaching methods. The third and final was Benjamin Nushmutt, introduced in Wayside School is Falling Down, being a boy who everyone believed was named Mark Miller up until the twenty-ninth chapter of the book.\\n\\nOther members of the school staff include Louis, a character based on Louis Sachar himself, being the school\\'s yard teacher with a mustache of many colors who is friends with all the kids; Miss Mush, the school\\'s cafeteria lady whose meals are so horrible, students rarely dare to eat them, as well as her assistant, Mr. Pepperadder, who only appears in the math spin-offs, being a person who is often pranked by Miss Mush because he is shorter than her. Mr. Kidswatter is the school principal, who hates all the kids and often over-reacts when things don\\'t go his way. Dr. Pickell is the school counselor, who uses hypnosis on the students to cure their ailments, but also add strange side-effects. Miss Zarves is the teacher of the nineteenth story, which doesn\\'t exist, and four kids named Ray, Virginia, Nick, and Mark. She and her students supposedly do not exist either. There is also Miss Worm, the teacher of the honors class story who is annoyed by Mrs. Jewls\\'s teaching methods. A few one-off characters include Mrs. Waloosh, the eccentric dance teacher at the school; Mrs. Franklin, a substitute from the second book that believed all the students were named Benjamin; Mrs. Day, the school secretary; and David, Mr. Kidswatter\\'s chaffeur.\\n\\nA few more characters include Hobo Bob, a hobo who hates socks brought in by Sharie for show-and-tell; Xavier Dalton, a man who made Ms. Nogard bitter and hateful after being disgusted by her third ear; Mr. Finch, a man who saved up his life savings to start an ice cream company; and the numerous cows, one of which ended up on the nineteenth story, that came to the school leading to it being shut down for 243 days.\\n\\nStory conventions [ edit ]\\n\\nIn Sideways Arithmetic From Wayside School , it is revealed the characters add, subtract, and multiply words. The children at Wayside School have no concept of adding numbers until Mrs. Jewls teaches the kids 4+7=11, in numbers, not words.\\n\\n, it is revealed the characters add, subtract, and multiply words. The children at Wayside School have no concept of adding numbers until Mrs. Jewls teaches the kids 4+7=11, in numbers, not words. If a student does something wrong once, Mrs. Jewls will write that student\\'s name under the word DISCIPLINE. If a student does something wrong a second time, Mrs. Jewls will put a check next to that student\\'s name. If a student does something wrong a third time, Mrs. Jewls will circle his/her name and send him/her home at noon on the kindergarten bus. Despite only needing three strikes, Mrs. Jewls resorts to also adding a triangle when Sammy was disruptive. Despite being a good student, Todd is sent home every day on the kindergarten bus as a result of him always unfairly getting in trouble each day. Paul is also sent home on the kindergarten bus, but only once, after pulling Leslie\\'s pigtails during class. Another time, when it looks like Joy was going to be sent home early, Todd thinks he is going to have company, but Joy ends up making up for her crime by kissing Jason on the nose so that he would come unstuck from the gum she put on his seat. Mrs. Jewls even sends herself home early for temporarily turning evil.\\n\\nGoozack was another word for door in the book Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger . After the principal ran into his office door and spilled coffee over his clothes, he said that the word \"door\" was a bad word. Anyone who said \"door\" would get in trouble. So he introduced the word \"goozack\" to replace the word door. Todd was the first student to break the new rule, only because he was late for school at the time and didn\\'t hear the announcement. Later, when Mrs. Drazil said \"door\" and the students pointed out that she was to call it \"goozack,\" she immediately said \"Mr. Kidswatter is a \\'goozack\\'\" in retaliation.\\n\\n.

In all three books in the Wayside School series, Chapter 19 differs strongly from other chapters. In the first book, that chapter is non-existent; in the second book, the 19th chapter takes up 3 chapters (all numbered 19) and based on Miss Zarves\\' classroom, a non-existent location (the last of these is followed by a chapter numbered \"20, 21, and 22\", all at once.) In the third book, Chapter 19 is also based on the non-existent location.\\n\\nIn all three books, Chapter 17 has the theme of things being done backwards. In the first book, John reads upside-down. The second book includes a chapter in which the paragraphs are read in reverse order, and the third book has a title which is paradoxical to its plot until the final sentences.\\n\\nIn the first book, Chapter 22 is about The Three Erics. In the second book, the 22nd chapter (Chapter, 20, 21, and 22) is also about the three Erics. And in the television series, the second half of Episode 22 is called The Three Erics.\\n\\nThe last sentence of each book is \"everybody _ooed.\" In the first book it says \"everybody booed.\" (due to Louis telling them a bad story about a regular school) The second book ends in \"everybody mooed,\" after Louis asks the cows in the building to leave. The third book ends in \"everybody ooohed,\" after Louis kisses Miss Nogard and it doesn\\'t say if they got married.\\n\\nOther media [ edit ]\\n\\nIn 2005, Nelvana produced an hour-long television special loosely based on the books called Wayside: The Movie. The special was later spun off into a series titled Wayside, which aired on Nickelodeon (U.S.) and Teletoon(Canada) from 2007 to 2008.\\n\\nReferences [ edit ]\\n\\nSachar, Louis.

       " \"Drama has struck parts of the BitTorrent community recently as the popular DVD ripper aXXo hasn't uploaded any torrents for several weeks. Recently a rumor surfaced that aXXo went to join a private BitTorrent tracker and continued to share his work there exclusively. But is this really the case?\\n\\nOver the years aXXo has been built up to cult figure status by many BitTorrent users, to a point where the mainstream press and even documentary film makers show an interest. This March aXXo went silent, but some claim that he is still active on a relatively unknown private tracker named Speed.cd.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, some blogs and commenters on Mininova picked up on this and reported that aXXo decided to go underground, releasing his torrents only on a few private trackers. Interestingly, he would also have left Darkside RG which was considered to be his home for years, and where he posted the following message only weeks ago.\\n\\n“My home is my beloved Darkside and as i’ve said so many times before on each of my torrents…. Be aware of bogus sites and lamers,” aXXo wrote.\\n\\nSo here are some facts. There is indeed a staff member called aXXo (with identical capitalization) on Speed.cd. He joined the site in January 2008 and has been uploading (some) aXXo rips after they appeared on public sites such as Mininova. After aXXo stopped releasing torrents elsewhere, aXXo on Speed.cd continued to upload movies.\\n\\nBut is this member called aXXo on Speed.cd the real deal? No, not even close. A quick comparison of the codecs used on these “new” aXXo releases and an examination of some of the metadata such as the ripping software and specs, clearly shows that it is not the same aXXo his fans know and love.\\n\\nAlso, it is a bit strange that the mystical aXXo only uploaded his releases sporadically onto the Speed.cd tracker before he stopped releasing on public sites three months ago. To us, these are all clear signs that we’re dealing with an impostor here.\\n\\nFor years aXXo has been warning followers to “beware of bogus sites and lamers,” but apparently that didn’t help much. Over recent weeks, thousands of people signed up at Speed.cd, and according to a poll on the site, most of them joined because of the ‘aXXo’ releases.\\n\\naXXo poll on Speed.cd\\n\\nThe aXXo user on the private tracker is clearly enjoying his new status, and has even changed the NFO files bundled with his releases to point to Speed.cd instead of DarksideRG. In the comments he is chatting with his new found fans and explaining why he decided to leave Mininova and Demonoid.\\n\\nThe site’s operators on the other hand are welcoming the many donations made by aXXo’s followers. “Since axxo is part of this site I have donated $10,” one user commented after buying some upload credit and VIP status. There are even better deals though. Three months of VIP access is only $50 and you’ll get a star next to your nickname as bonus.\\n\\nThen again, if thousands of people can’t spot the difference between the uploads of aXXo and the fake aXXo, does it really matter? We’re inclined to say no, if it wasn’t for the price lists and money begging going on at that site.\\n\\nLet’s hope that they don’t have the MPAA fooled and end up with their servers raided by the authorities. That would be a shame.\\n\\nUpdate: A topic on Speed.cd linking to this article was quickly removed….\",\n",
       " 'Pretty incredible numbers, right? I couldn\\'t believe what I was reading when I saw these estimations on ad revenue. Even without the revenue, the view counts and subscriptions alone are staggering. The creators of these YouTube channels are producing content targeted at children in that age range because more and more parents nowadays are simply handing their laptop/ipad/smartphone over to their child to entertain them - or just keep their attention. Clearly the video creators have done their research, because some of their videos are over 3 hours in length! So if you\\'re looking to capitalise on the video sharing platform, perhaps jumping on popular, widely known YouTube growth industries like podcasting, vlogging and gaming - is not the best approach. What is really smart about these video creators is that they obviously realised the revenue potential from ads in this model. Why? Because when a parent hands over their device with a nursery rhyme video playing, they are just happy to have the child pay attention to the video stay out of trouble. Why is this important? Because no child between the ages of 1 and 5 years old knows when an advertisement is playing in the video, and thus will watch the entire ad, giving the video creator maximum revenue from every ad they place in a video. Interesting stuff, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nThis is a question on the tip of many would-be content creators\\' tongues that are seriously contemplating diving into creating a YouTube channel and attempting to make a stable living from the goliath entertainment platform.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, is this a realistically achievable goal? Well, the short answer is neither yes nor no...\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore you even consider considering this, you will need to understand that nothing can be guaranteed. \"Job security\" is a term that has no place in the world of YouTube content creation. Every single YouTube channel that bit the bullet and committed to producing and publishing videos on a consistent basis for a significant amount of time (or even with no end date in mind) did so by setting aside any hope or assumption of gaining financial security from the endeavour.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the world\\'s most successfully YouTube vloggers and \\'pranksters\\', to the more niche-focused channels on learning/educating, all the way to gaming YouTuber\\'s -- many of whom are now multi-millionaires thanks to their staggering YouTube numbers -- none had any guarantee or quantifiable way to project when or how much money they could consistently make month-over-month or even annually by doing X amount of videos per week.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut what about the channels mentioned in the above infographic?\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is where we get into more \"shady\" waters. Aside from the family vloggers listed in the infographic, the channels here are clearly not \"following their passion\" with crudely produced animations aimed at kids that can barely comprehend \"high quality\" content from very sub-par productions.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith that in mind, there was definitely a calculated risk taken by these channels, with the sole purpose of each channel\\'s creation being on \"milking the cow\" of this lucrative target demographic as much as possible; as fast as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy doing so, these channel creators have been steadily earning crazy good money for multiple years now. Even the lowest estimated monthly earnings for each channel still clearly massively outweigh the cost of video production and whatever marketing the channels may be doing to extend the reach of each video.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo to that end, the most conclusive answer to the question posed in this closing section is this:\\n\\n\\n\\nYes. You can still make a very lucrative living from YouTube today -- BUT -- you will either have to insanely passionate about what you do (to remain consistent and of the best quality you can be for a long time, with money being a secondary motivator), or be insanely smart about researching the highest revenue-generating target niche market as possible. Even then - there can be zero guarantees of your financial future being consistent secure by taking that leap.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the end of the day, you should sit down and be as honest with yourself as possible when asking the following two questions:\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Do I care about doing X passion topic, producing a large, consistent library of top quality videos over a long period of time, enough to be completely fine with the very real potential that I may not earn a single penny from the endeavour?\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Have I done research on X non-passion (but rather \"money\") topic, producing a large, consistent library of videos over a long period of time, enough to be as sure as I can be that doing so is a smart financial decision and will bring me returns that I will be happy with?\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the answer is yes to either of those, then personally I say life is too short not to give a shot. Especially if you have been deliberating over a channel idea for a long time, so much so that it clearly means enough to you to remain in your mind for so long.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever you decide to do - definitely use the infographic on this page as a symbol of just how lucrative YouTube can be when you are either [a] creative enough or [b] smart enough with the channel you decide to create.\\n\\n\\n\\n... of course, the golden nugget would be to create a channel that you are both passionate about that is also targeted at a very lucrative demographic!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Heads up… this post is old! For an updated version of this post, see Token Authentication in ASP.NET Core 2.0 – A Complete Guide on the Okta developer blog.\\n\\nSecurity update: Make sure you read this security advisory if you handle JWTs in your code. The examples and sample code in this article have been updated to use the fixed version of the affected packages.\\n\\nToken authentication is quickly becoming a de facto standard for modern single-page applications and mobile apps. Even traditional server-rendered applications and web APIs can take advantage of token authentication. The benefits are great: less server state to manage, better scalability, and a consistent identity and authentication mechanism across web and mobile clients.\\n\\nIf you need a refresher on how tokens work, read our overview of token authentication and JWTs. All clear? Great!\\n\\nToken authentication in ASP.NET Core is a mixed bag. The ability to protect routes with Bearer header JWTs is included, but the ability to generate the tokens themselves has been removed and requires the use of custom middleware or external packages. Despite this, both MVC and Web API applications can benefit from using tokens for authentication, and it turns out it’s not very hard to set up.\\n\\nHow do you implement both sides of token authentication – token verification and token generation – on the new ASP.NET Core stack? I’ll break down the process step by step. All of the code in this post can be found on Github.\\n\\nCookies or Headers for Authentication?\\n\\nFirst, some background. Authentication tokens (such as JWTs) are typically transmitted in the HTTP Authorization header, like this:\\n\\nGET /foo Authorization: Bearer [token] 1 2 3 GET / foo Authorization : Bearer [ token ]\\n\\nTokens can also be transmitted via browser cookies. Which transport method you choose (headers or cookies) depends on your application and use case. For mobile applications, headers are the way to go.\\n\\nFor web applications, we recommend using HttpOnly cookies instead of HTML5 storage/headers, for better security against XSS attacks. It’s important to note that using cookies means that you need to protect your forms against CSRF attacks (by using ASP.NET Core’s AntiForgery features, for example).\\n\\nValidating Tokens in ASP.NET Core\\n\\nFirst, you’ll need to create a SecurityKey from your secret key. For this example, I’m creating a symmetrical key to sign and validate JWTs with HMAC-SHA256. You can do this in your Startup.cs file:\\n\\n// secretKey contains a secret passphrase only your server knows var secretKey = \"mysupersecret_secretkey!123\"; var signingKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(secretKey)); 1 2 3 4 // secretKey contains a secret passphrase only your server knows var secretKey = \"mysupersecret_secretkey!123\" ; var signingKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey ( Encoding . ASCII . GetBytes ( secretKey ) ) ;\\n\\nValidating JWTs in Headers\\n\\nIn your Startup class, you can use the UseJwtBearerAuthentication method in the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer package to require a valid JWT for your protected MVC or Web API routes:\\n\\nvar tokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters { // The signing key must match! ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true, IssuerSigningKey = signingKey, // Validate the JWT Issuer (iss) claim ValidateIssuer = true, ValidIssuer = \"ExampleIssuer\", // Validate the JWT Audience (aud) claim ValidateAudience = true, ValidAudience = \"ExampleAudience\", // Validate the token expiry ValidateLifetime = true, // If you want to allow a certain amount of clock drift, set that here: ClockSkew = TimeSpan.Zero }; app.UseJwtBearerAuthentication(new JwtBearerOptions { AutomaticAuthenticate = true, AutomaticChallenge = true, TokenValidationParameters = tokenValidationParameters }); 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 var tokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters { // The signing key must match! ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true , IssuerSigningKey = signingKey , // Validate the JWT Issuer (iss) claim ValidateIssuer = true , ValidIssuer = \"ExampleIssuer\" , // Validate the JWT Audience (aud) claim ValidateAudience = true , ValidAudience = \"ExampleAudience\" , // Validate the token expiry ValidateLifetime = true , // If you want to allow a certain amount of clock drift, set that here: ClockSkew = TimeSpan . Zero } ; app . UseJwtBearerAuthentication ( new JwtBearerOptions { AutomaticAuthenticate = true , AutomaticChallenge = true , TokenValidationParameters = tokenValidationParameters } ) ;\\n\\nWith this middleware added to your application pipeline, any routes protected with [Authorize] will require a JWT that passes the following validation requirements:\\n\\nThe signature matches your server’s secret key\\n\\nThe expiration date ( exp claim) has not passed\\n\\nThe not-before date ( nbf claim) has passed\\n\\nThe Issuer ( iss ) claim matches “ExampleIssuer”\\n\\nThe Audience ( aud ) claim matches “ExampleAudience”\\n\\nIf there is not a valid JWT in the Authorization header, or it fails these validation steps, the request will be rejected. If you’re not familiar with the JWT spec, the Issuer and Audience claims are optional. They are being used here to identify the application (issuer) and the client (audience).\\n\\nValidating JWTs in Cookies\\n\\nOut of the box, the ASP.NET Core cookie authentication middleware doesn’t support validating JWTs passed via cookies. You’ll need to create a custom ISecureDataFormat implementation that validates a JWT string.\\n\\nSince you’re only validating tokens, not creating them, you only need to implement the Unprotect method. The heavy lifting can be handled by the JwtSecurityTokenHandler class in the System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt namespace. The full custom formatter class looks like this:\\n\\nusing System; using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt; using System.Security.Claims; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Authentication; using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens; namespace SimpleTokenProvider { public class CustomJwtDataFormat : ISecureDataFormat<AuthenticationTicket> { private readonly string algorithm; private readonly TokenValidationParameters validationParameters; public CustomJwtDataFormat(string algorithm, TokenValidationParameters validationParameters) { this.algorithm = algorithm; this.validationParameters = validationParameters; } public AuthenticationTicket Unprotect(string protectedText) => Unprotect(protectedText, null); public AuthenticationTicket Unprotect(string protectedText, string purpose) { var handler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler(); ClaimsPrincipal principal = null; SecurityToken validToken = null; try { principal = handler.ValidateToken(protectedText, this.validationParameters, out validToken); var validJwt = validToken as JwtSecurityToken; if (validJwt == null) { throw new ArgumentException(\"Invalid JWT\"); } if (!validJwt.Header.Alg.Equals(algorithm, StringComparison.Ordinal)) { throw new ArgumentException($\"Algorithm must be \\'{algorithm}\\'\"); } // Additional custom validation of JWT claims here (if any) } catch (SecurityTokenValidationException) { return null; } catch (ArgumentException) { return null; } // Validation passed. Return a valid AuthenticationTicket: return new AuthenticationTicket(principal, new AuthenticationProperties(), \"Cookie\"); } // This ISecureDataFormat implementation is decode-only public string Protect(AuthenticationTicket data) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } public string Protect(AuthenticationTicket data, string purpose) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 using System ; using System . IdentityModel . Tokens . Jwt ; using System . Security . Claims ; using Microsoft . AspNetCore . Authentication ; using Microsoft . AspNetCore . Http . Authentication ; using Microsoft . IdentityModel . Tokens ; namespace SimpleTokenProvider { public class CustomJwtDataFormat : ISecureDataFormat < AuthenticationTicket > { private readonly string algorithm ; private readonly TokenValidationParameters validationParameters ; public CustomJwtDataFormat ( string algorithm , TokenValidationParameters validationParameters ) { this . algorithm = algorithm ; this . validationParameters = validationParameters ; } public AuthenticationTicket Unprotect ( string protectedText ) = > Unprotect ( protectedText , null ) ; public AuthenticationTicket Unprotect ( string protectedText , string purpose ) { var handler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler ( ) ; ClaimsPrincipal principal = null ; SecurityToken validToken = null ; try { principal = handler . ValidateToken ( protectedText , this . validationParameters , out validToken ) ; var validJwt = validToken as JwtSecurityToken ; if ( validJwt == null ) { throw new ArgumentException ( \"Invalid JWT\" ) ; } if ( ! validJwt . Header . Alg . Equals ( algorithm , StringComparison . Ordinal ) ) { throw new ArgumentException ( $ \"Algorithm must be \\'{algorithm}\\'\" ) ; } // Additional custom validation of JWT claims here (if any) } catch ( SecurityTokenValidationException ) { return null ; } catch ( ArgumentException ) { return null ; } // Validation passed. Return a valid AuthenticationTicket: return new AuthenticationTicket ( principal , new AuthenticationProperties ( ) , \"Cookie\" ) ; } // This ISecureDataFormat implementation is decode-only public string Protect ( AuthenticationTicket data ) { throw new NotImplementedException ( ) ; } public string Protect ( AuthenticationTicket data , string purpose ) { throw new NotImplementedException ( ) ; } } }\\n\\nWire this class up with UseCookieAuthentication in your Startup.cs file:\\n\\nvar tokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters { // The signing key must match! ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true, IssuerSigningKey = signingKey, // Validate the JWT Issuer (iss) claim ValidateIssuer = true, ValidIssuer = \"ExampleIssuer\", // Validate the JWT Audience (aud) claim ValidateAudience = true, ValidAudience = \"ExampleAudience\", // Validate the token expiry ValidateLifetime = true, // If you want to allow a certain amount of clock drift, set that here: ClockSkew = TimeSpan.Zero }; app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions { AutomaticAuthenticate = true, AutomaticChallenge = true, AuthenticationScheme = \"Cookie\", CookieName = \"access_token\", TicketDataFormat = new CustomJwtDataFormat( SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256, tokenValidationParameters) }); 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 var tokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters { // The signing key must match! ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true , IssuerSigningKey = signingKey , // Validate the JWT Issuer (iss) claim ValidateIssuer = true , ValidIssuer = \"ExampleIssuer\" , // Validate the JWT Audience (aud) claim ValidateAudience = true , ValidAudience = \"ExampleAudience\" , // Validate the token expiry ValidateLifetime = true , // If you want to allow a certain amount of clock drift, set that here: ClockSkew = TimeSpan . Zero } ; app . UseCookieAuthentication ( new CookieAuthenticationOptions { AutomaticAuthenticate = true , AutomaticChallenge = true , AuthenticationScheme = \"Cookie\" , CookieName = \"access_token\" , TicketDataFormat = new CustomJwtDataFormat ( SecurityAlgorithms . HmacSha256 , tokenValidationParameters ) } ) ;\\n\\nThat’s it!\\n\\nIf an incoming cookie named access_token contains a valid JWT, your protected MVC or Web API routes will be authorized. If you want, you can do additional validation of the JWT claims (or copy the JWT claims into the ClaimsPrincipal object) inside of CustomJwtDataFormat.Unprotect .\\n\\nIf you’re using cookies to transport your JWTs between the browser and the server, we recommend the following best practices for security:\\n\\nSet the HttpOnly flag\\n\\nSet the Secure flag as well, if your site is hosted on HTTPS (and it should be!)\\n\\nUse the [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attribute on any forms that accept a POST\\n\\nThat takes care of the validation side of token authentication, but what about generating the tokens themselves?\\n\\nGenerating Tokens in ASP.NET Core\\n\\nBack in the ASP.NET 4.5 days, the UseOAuthAuthorizationServer middleware provided an endpoint that could easily generate tokens for your application. However, the ASP.NET Core team decided not to port it to ASP.NET Core.\\n\\nNever fear! I’ll demonstrate how to write a simple token-generating middleware from scratch, and then conclude with a few links to pre-built solutions that could save you some time.\\n\\nWriting a Simple Token Endpoint\\n\\nFirst, you’ll need a simple POCO (plain ol’ CLR object) to hold a few options for the middleware class you’ll write. Create a new class called TokenProviderOptions.cs :\\n\\nusing System; using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens; namespace SimpleTokenProvider { public class TokenProviderOptions { public string Path { get; set; } = \"/token\"; public string Issuer { get; set; } public string Audience { get; set; } public TimeSpan Expiration { get; set; } = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5); public SigningCredentials SigningCredentials { get; set; } } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 using System ; using Microsoft . IdentityModel . Tokens ; namespace SimpleTokenProvider { public class TokenProviderOptions { public string Path { get ; set ; } = \"/token\" ; public string Issuer { get ; set ; } public string Audience { get ; set ; } public TimeSpan Expiration { get ; set ; } = TimeSpan . FromMinutes ( 5 ) ; public SigningCredentials SigningCredentials { get ; set ; } } }\\n\\nNow you can build the middleware class itself. The basic pattern for ASP.NET Core middleware is this:\\n\\nusing System; using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt; using System.Security.Claims; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http; using Microsoft.Extensions.Options; using Newtonsoft.Json; namespace SimpleTokenProvider { public class TokenProviderMiddleware { private readonly RequestDelegate _next; private readonly TokenProviderOptions _options; public TokenProviderMiddleware( RequestDelegate next, IOptions<TokenProviderOptions> options) { _next = next; _options = options.Value; } public Task Invoke(HttpContext context) { // If the request path doesn\\'t match, skip if (!context.Request.Path.Equals(_options.Path, StringComparison.Ordinal)) { return _next(context); } // Request must be POST with Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded if (!context.Request.Method.Equals(\"POST\") || !context.Request.HasFormContentType) { context.Response.StatusCode = 400; return context.Response.WriteAsync(\"Bad request.\"); } return GenerateToken(context); } } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 using System ; using System . IdentityModel . Tokens . Jwt ; using System . Security . Claims ; using System . Threading . Tasks ; using Microsoft . AspNetCore . Http ; using Microsoft . Extensions . Options ; using Newtonsoft . Json ; namespace SimpleTokenProvider { public class TokenProviderMiddleware { private readonly RequestDelegate _next ; private readonly TokenProviderOptions _options ; public TokenProviderMiddleware ( RequestDelegate next , IOptions < TokenProviderOptions > options ) { _next = next ; _options = options . Value ; } public Task Invoke ( HttpContext context ) { // If the request path doesn\\'t match, skip if ( ! context . Request . Path . Equals ( _options . Path , StringComparison . Ordinal ) ) { return _next ( context ) ; } // Request must be POST with Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded if ( ! context . Request . Method . Equals ( \"POST\" ) || ! context . Request . HasFormContentType ) { context . Response . StatusCode = 400 ; return context . Response . WriteAsync ( \"Bad request.\" ) ; } return GenerateToken ( context ) ; } } }\\n\\nThis scaffolding creates a middleware class that can be added to the ASP.NET Core application pipeline and accepts a TokenProviderOptions instance as a parameter. When a request enters the pipeline, the Invoke method checks the request path and skips if it doesn’t match the exact path the middleware should be handling (such as /token or /api/token ). The token endpoint also shouldn’t respond to anything but a POST with a form-urlencoded body, so the request method and Content-Type are checked as well.\\n\\nThe heavy lifting happens in GenerateToken . This method needs to validate a user identity (given a username and password), and generate a signed token (JWT) to pass back to the client if that identity exists:\\n\\nprivate async Task GenerateToken(HttpContext context) { var username = context.Request.Form[\"username\"]; var password = context.Request.Form[\"password\"]; var identity = await GetIdentity(username, password); if (identity == null) { context.Response.StatusCode = 400; await context.Response.WriteAsync(\"Invalid username or password.\"); return; } var now = DateTime.UtcNow; // Specifically add the jti (random nonce), iat (issued timestamp), and sub (subject/user) claims. // You can add other claims here, if you want: var claims = new Claim[] { new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub, username), new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Jti, Guid.NewGuid().ToString()), new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Iat, now.ToUnixTimeSeconds().ToString(), ClaimValueTypes.Integer64) }; // Create the JWT and write it to a string var jwt = new JwtSecurityToken( issuer: _options.Issuer, audience: _options.Audience, claims: claims, notBefore: now, expires: now.Add(_options.Expiration), signingCredentials: _options.SigningCredentials); var encodedJwt = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler().WriteToken(jwt); var response = new { access_token = encodedJwt, expires_in = (int)_options.Expiration.TotalSeconds }; // Serialize and return the response context.Response.ContentType = \"application/json\"; await context.Response.WriteAsync(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response, new JsonSerializerSettings { Formatting = Formatting.Indented })); } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 private async Task GenerateToken ( HttpContext context ) { var username = context . Request . Form [ \"username\" ] ; var password = context . Request . Form [ \"password\" ] ; var identity = await GetIdentity ( username , password ) ; if ( identity == null ) { context . Response . StatusCode = 400 ; await context . Response . WriteAsync ( \"Invalid username or password.\" ) ; return ; } var now = DateTime . UtcNow ; // Specifically add the jti (random nonce), iat (issued timestamp), and sub (subject/user) claims. // You can add other claims here, if you want: var claims = new Claim [ ] { new Claim ( JwtRegisteredClaimNames . Sub , username ) , new Claim ( JwtRegisteredClaimNames . Jti , Guid . NewGuid ( ) . ToString ( ) ) , new Claim ( JwtRegisteredClaimNames . Iat , now . ToUnixTimeSeconds ( ) . ToString ( ) , ClaimValueTypes . Integer64 ) } ; // Create the JWT and write it to a string var jwt = new JwtSecurityToken ( issuer : _options . Issuer , audience : _options . Audience , claims : claims , notBefore : now , expires : now . Add ( _options . Expiration ) , signingCredentials : _options . SigningCredentials ) ; var encodedJwt = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler ( ) . WriteToken ( jwt ) ; var response = new { access_token = encodedJwt , expires_in = ( int ) _options . Expiration . TotalSeconds } ; // Serialize and return the response context . Response . ContentType = \"application/json\" ; await context . Response . WriteAsync ( JsonConvert . SerializeObject ( response , new JsonSerializerSettings { Formatting = Formatting . Indented } ) ) ; }\\n\\nMost of this method is just plumbing code. It uses the JwtSecurityToken class to build up a JWT payload, and then JwtSecurityTokenHandler writes it to an encoded string. You can store any custom claim you want in the payload by simply adding it to the claims array.\\n\\nThe task of validating a user’s identity given their username and password is further abstracted away to the GetIdentity method. In a real application, you’d plug this into your user database or an identity framework like ASP.NET Core Identity. For the purposes of this example, you can hardcode the lookup:\\n\\nprivate Task<ClaimsIdentity> GetIdentity(string username, string password) { // DON\\'T do this in production, obviously! if (username == \"TEST\" && password == \"TEST123\") { return Task.FromResult(new ClaimsIdentity(new System.Security.Principal.GenericIdentity(username, \"Token\"), new Claim[] { })); } // Credentials are invalid, or account doesn\\'t exist return Task.FromResult<ClaimsIdentity>(null); } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 private Task < ClaimsIdentity > GetIdentity ( string username , string password ) { // DON\\'T do this in production, obviously! if ( username == \"TEST\" && password == \"TEST123\" ) { return Task . FromResult ( new ClaimsIdentity ( new System . Security . Principal . GenericIdentity ( username , \"Token\" ) , new Claim [ ] { } ) ) ; } // Credentials are invalid, or account doesn\\'t exist return Task . FromResult < ClaimsIdentity > ( null ) ; }\\n\\nAll done! You can wire the new middleware class up in Startup.cs by adding the middleware to your application pipeline:\\n\\nusing System.Text; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting; using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration; using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection; using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; using Microsoft.Extensions.Options; using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens; namespace SimpleTokenProvider { public partial class Startup { public Startup(IHostingEnvironment env) { var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\", optional: true); Configuration = builder.Build(); } public IConfigurationRoot Configuration { get; set; } public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { services.AddMvc(); } // The secret key every token will be signed with. // In production, you should store this securely in environment variables // or a key management tool. Don\\'t hardcode this into your application! private static readonly string secretKey = \"mysupersecret_secretkey!123\"; public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory) { loggerFactory.AddConsole(LogLevel.Debug); loggerFactory.AddDebug(); app.UseStaticFiles(); // Add JWT generation endpoint: var signingKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(secretKey)); var options = new TokenProviderOptions { Audience = \"ExampleAudience\", Issuer = \"ExampleIssuer\", SigningCredentials = new SigningCredentials(signingKey, SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256), }; app.UseMiddleware<TokenProviderMiddleware>(Options.Create(options)); app.UseMvc(); } } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 using System . Text ; using Microsoft . AspNetCore . Builder ; using Microsoft . AspNetCore . Hosting ; using Microsoft . Extensions . Configuration ; using Microsoft . Extensions . DependencyInjection ; using Microsoft . Extensions . Logging ; using Microsoft . Extensions . Options ; using Microsoft . IdentityModel . Tokens ; namespace SimpleTokenProvider { public partial class Startup { public Startup ( IHostingEnvironment env ) { var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder ( ) . AddJsonFile ( \"appsettings.json\" , optional : true ) ; Configuration = builder . Build ( ) ; } public IConfigurationRoot Configuration { get ; set ; } public void ConfigureServices ( IServiceCollection services ) { services . AddMvc ( ) ; } // The secret key every token will be signed with. // In production, you should store this securely in environment variables // or a key management tool. Don\\'t hardcode this into your application! private static readonly string secretKey = \"mysupersecret_secretkey!123\" ; public void Configure ( IApplicationBuilder app , IHostingEnvironment env , ILoggerFactory loggerFactory ) { loggerFactory . AddConsole ( LogLevel . Debug ) ; loggerFactory . AddDebug ( ) ; app . UseStaticFiles ( ) ; // Add JWT generation endpoint: var signingKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey ( Encoding . ASCII . GetBytes ( secretKey ) ) ; var options = new TokenProviderOptions { Audience = \"ExampleAudience\" , Issuer = \"ExampleIssuer\" , SigningCredentials = new SigningCredentials ( signingKey , SecurityAlgorithms . HmacSha256 ) , } ; app . UseMiddleware < TokenProviderMiddleware > ( Options . Create ( options ) ) ; app . UseMvc ( ) ; } } }\\n\\nOnce you’ve added it, fire up the application and use a tool like Fiddler or Postman to send a POST request to the new endpoint:\\n\\nPOST /token Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded username=TEST&password=TEST123 1 2 3 4 5 POST / token Content - Type : application / x - www - form - urlencoded username = TEST & password = TEST123\\n\\nIf the username and password are valid, you’ll get a token response:\\n\\n200 OK Content-Type: application/json { \"access_token\": \"eyJhb...\", \"expires_in\": 300 } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 200 OK Content - Type : application / json { \"access_token\" : \"eyJhb...\" , \"expires_in\" : 300 }\\n\\nYou can use a tool like jsonwebtoken.io to decode the JWT and see the payload.\\n\\nThat’s it! You now have a endpoint that issues JWTs for valid users. If you’re writing a mobile or single-page application or web API, you can store the JWT and send it in the Authorization header on subsequent requests. If you want to store the JWT in a browser cookie, you’ll need to make a small modification to the endpoint so that it adds a cookie to the response.\\n\\nOther ASP.NET Core Authentication Solutions\\n\\nThis example works, but it’s simple. It doesn’t support refresh tokens or other methods of exchanging user credentials for an access token. There are some community-led efforts to build rich ASP.NET Core token authentication functionality:\\n\\nAspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server – Similar to the OAuth Authorization Server middleware for ASP.NET 4.x.\\n\\nOpenIddict – Wraps OpenIdConnect.Server up into an easier-to-use package that plugs into ASP.NET Identity.\\n\\nIdentityServer4 – A port of Thinktecture IdentityServer3 to .NET Core (currently in beta).\\n\\nThese solutions are much more powerful, but are also more complex to install and configure. If you want a powerful and simple solution, check out the Stormpath ASP.NET Core integration. This package will add all of Stormpath’s token management features to an ASP.NET Core project with two lines of code. You can learn more about Stormpath’s approach to token management with these resources:\\n\\nThanks for reading! Feel free to dig into the full code on Github. If you have any questions about token authentication, leave me a comment below.\\n\\nBy the way, I’ll be speaking on ASP.NET Core Token Authentication at KCDC in Kansas City in June 2016.

And where the mind goes, so does the body.\\n\\nI recently read a gratitude routine that I think is probably really effective – use a jar, box, container and put it at your front door with small slivers of paper next to, and everyday before you leave your house take one of the sheets of paper and write down:\\n\\n1. Something you are grateful for.\\n\\n2. Something that you want.\\n\\n3. The actions you will take to get there.\\n\\nSo an example would be:\\n\\n1. I am thankful for all of this excellent plastic in my disc golf bag.\\n\\n2. I would like to sink more 25 foot putts.\\n\\n3. I am going to do this by practicing putting every day.\\n\\nAnother example might be in your life off of the course:',\n",
       " 'There appears to be some uh . . . work being done to a few of the (long-time-since-they’ve-been-rented) rooms at the former Downtown Days Inn building at 801 St. Joseph Pkwy., also known as Houston’s last remaining (for now) abandoned skyscraper. Look at the lowest level of windows above the parking garage in the top photo.

The short-lived hyper success of the internet startup age did not die in vain; the phenomenon fundamentally changed technological innovation, business models, investment mentalities and the global financial markets. Now in our post-recessionary age, experts are predicting that similar to internet startups, cannabis will be the next industry to rock the business, financial and investment worlds.\\n\\nMore than 14 million Americans consume marijuana on a regular basis. Legal marijuana sales totaled $2.3 billion in 2014 alone whereas the illegal marijuana market is said to produce more than $18 billion in revenue per year. If we momentarily put aside the legal controversy, the numbers alone reveal that regulated cannabis is a major potential market that remains largely untapped. Despite the federal ban against the drug, there are currently more than 23 states and U.S. territories which have implemented some form of medical or recreational marijuana decriminalization. As more states pass marijuana legal reform, an increasing number of entrepreneurs and investors view the \"Green Rush\" as a major business opportunity with the potential to transform the pharmaceutical, food & beverage and commercial industries.\\n\\nSome investors are wary of betting their chances on a product that the federal government still labels as a Schedule 1 substance. The disparate federal and state laws create an environment of uncertainty that make many investors rightfully nervous. Another concern lies in the recent high volatility of certain publicly traded marijuana stock which can be a reminder of the rollercoaster days we saw back in the dotcom heyday. Additionally, instances where cannabis companies released misleading or even falsified information about its employees and/or products has made it harder for investors to differentiate between legitimate operations with clean track records and shady businesses seeking to manipulate investors.',\n",
       " 'Clue remake lands at 20th Century Fox\\n\\nBack in 2011, Universal Pictures ceased development on turning the Hasbro board game Clue into a feature film. Now the ball is in a new court as Tracking Board reports that 20th Century Fox has signed on to produce a Clue remake that may well be quite different from the 1985 original.\\n\\nThe previous Universal iteration of the remake had Gore Verbinksi (The Lone Ranger, Rango, Pirates of the Caribbean) attached to produce and potentially direct through his Blind Wink productions, although it is unknown if he is still attached. Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama had previously been brought aboard to write a screenplay that reconceived the single-house parlor mystery as a globe-trotting thriller with deductive reasoning at its core, which seems to remain the plan for the Fox version. How this will change the dynamic of the central conceit is unclear, although it will certainly open it up to broader worldwide appeal.\\n\\nJosh Feldman (My Little Pony: The Movie) will produce for Hasbro Studios, with Ryan Jones serving as executive producer.\\n\\nClue was originally released as a game in 1948, created in England by a retired legal clerk named Anthony Pratt. The 1985 film version was directed by Jonathan Lynn and starred Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Martin Mull, Lesley Ann Warren and Eileen Brennan, and was released with three possible endings. Although not a box office success, it developed a strong cult following on home video (where all three endings are presented back-to-back) and is now considered one of the most beloved comedies of the ’80s.',\n",

       " 'Internment is the imprisonment of people, commonly in large groups, without charges[1] or intent to file charges,[2] and thus no trial. The term is especially used for the confinement \"of enemy citizens in wartime or of terrorism suspects\".[3] Thus, while it can simply mean imprisonment, it tends to refer to preventive confinement, rather than confinement after having been convicted of some crime. Use of these terms is subject to debate and political sensitivities.[4]\\n\\nInterned persons may be held in prisons or in facilities known as internment camps. In certain contexts, these may also be known either officially or pejoratively, as concentration camps.\\n\\nInternment also refers to a neutral country\\'s practice of detaining belligerent armed forces and equipment on its territory during times of war under the Hague Convention of 1907.[5]\\n\\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights restricts the use of internment. Article 9 states that \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.\"[6]\\n\\nDefining internship and \"concentration camp\" [ edit ]\\n\\nThe American Heritage Dictionary defines the term concentration camp as: \"A camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions, often as a result of their membership in a group the government has identified as dangerous or undesirable.\"[7]\\n\\nAlthough the first example of civilian internment may date as far back as the 1830s[8], the English term concentration camp was first used in order to refer to the reconcentrados (reconcentration camps) set up by the Spanish military in Cuba during the Ten Years\\' War (1868–78).[9] The term saw wider use around the Second Boer War (1899–1902), when the British operated such camps in South Africa for interning Boers.[9][10]\\n\\nDuring and after the American Civil War, concentration camps located in Natchez, Mississippi were used to corral freed slaves. \"As slaves were being emancipated from the plantations, their route to freedom usually took them in the vicinity of the Union army forces. Unhappy with the slaves being freed, the army began recapturing the slaves and forced the men back into hard labor camps. The most notorious of the several concentration camps that were established was located in Natchez, MS.\"[11]\\n\\nDuring the 20th century, the arbitrary internment of civilians by the state reached its most extreme form with the establishment of the Nazi concentration camps (1933–45). The Nazi concentration camp system was extensive, with as many as 15,000 camps[12] and at least 715,000 simultaneous internees.[13] The total number of casualties in these camps is difficult to determine, but the conscious policy of extermination through labor in at least some of the camps ensured that the inmates would die of starvation, untreated disease and summary executions.[14] Moreover, Nazi Germany established six extermination camps, specifically designed to kill millions, primarily by gassing.[15][16]\\n\\nAs a result, the term \"concentration camp\" today is sometimes conflated with the concept of \"extermination camp\" and historians debate whether the term \"concentration camp\" or \"internment camp\" should be used to describe other examples of civilian internment.[4]\\n\\nSee also [ edit ]\\n\\nReferences [ edit ]',\n",

       " 'AMD is leading us into a new, exciting era of graphics technology - where ultra-fast memory is connected directly to the core, enabling higher performance, enhanced power efficiency and a new wave of small form-factor graphics cards. The Radeon R9 Fury X is the first GPU to arrive boasting this cutting-edge tech, with AMD telling us that it is the fastest single-chip GPU on the market, a title currently held by Nvidia\\'s mammoth Titan X 12GB. Well, the reality is that the Fury X is a fascinating first-gen product with plenty of positives, but in terms of raw performance, both Nvidia\\'s Titan X and its cut-down GTX 980 Ti are generally faster and more versatile for the high-end enthusiast market.\\n\\nAs always, performance is king, so AMD\\'s inability to be comprehensively competitive with Nvidia\\'s GM200 across the length and breadth of our benchmarks is a little disappointing - but certainly in terms of the physical package, it\\'s great to see that the poor reference cooling design of the 200 series is now a thing of the past. The Fury X is built from quality materials that look good and even feel good, and the dinky, compact nature of the 7.5-inch board is quite remarkable - it\\'s a marvel of integration. The work AMD carried out on the Radeon R9 295X2\\'s reference water cooler is carried over and refined on Fury X, which also has its own closed-loop set-up that is significantly quieter than Nvidia\\'s reference coolers, though it is accompanied by a continuous, consistent, high-pitched tone - presumably emanating from the pump. It was a little bothersome on the test bench, but will hopefully be less of an issue when the card is installed deep within a decent case.\\n\\nRadeon R9 Fury X specs The Fiji processor in the R9 Fury X is based on AMD\\'s third generation GCN architecture, previously found in the R9 295/380, and codenamed Tonga. Doubling up on stream processors brings the shader count up to a gargantuan 4096, up from the 2816 found in the R9 290X/390X. This core is then combined with the ultra-fast, ultra-wide HBM RAM. Stream Processors: 4096\\n\\n4096 Texture Units: 256\\n\\n256 ROPs: 64\\n\\n64 Max Clock: 1050MHz\\n\\n1050MHz Memory: 4GB HBM\\n\\n4GB HBM Memory Clock: 100MHz\\n\\n100MHz Bandwidth: 512GB/s\\n\\n512GB/s Process: 28nm\\n\\n28nm Transistor count: 8.9bn\\n\\n8.9bn Max TFLOPs: 8.6\\n\\n8.6 Die Size: 596mm 2\\n\\n596mm TDP: 275W AMD announced a $650 price-point for Fury X in the USA, bringing it into line with the GTX 980 Ti. In the UK, Fury X starts at £509 - which is a good deal cheaper than current 980 Ti prices here.\\n\\nComparisons with decent aftermarket coolers are interesting though - the fan mounted onto the radiator isn\\'t silent when it\\'s really being pushed and the overall package isn\\'t that much quieter than the MSI cooler we saw recently on the R9 390X. The difference comes down to the fact that the radiator is mounted on the case where it can directly push heat out of the chassis - something the fancy third-party coolers rely upon case airflow to achieve.\\n\\nThe aesthetics are finished off with a red LED Radeon logo, along with a series of lights designed to give some rudimentary measurement of GPU load. Other features include a dual-BIOS switch (there are two BIOSes, one of which you can re-write), while power is supplied via two eight-pin inputs fed from your PSU. Display outputs consist of three DisplayPorts, along with HDMI 1.4a video. The end of the DVI port is nigh, it seems.\\n\\nOrder the Radeon R9 Fury X [?] from Amazon with free shipping\\n\\nThis is usually the part of the review where we get some idea of a new GPU\\'s capabilities by running it through our Crysis 3 gameplay test - where we attempt to run the game at a display\\'s native resolution and as close to its refresh rate as possible: 60Hz. Which brings up an interesting point - Fury X is seemingly targeted at 4K gamers, but the reality is that the latest top-tier GPUs are much more suited to 1440p gameplay with all the visual trimmings. And this presents a slight issue: as you\\'ll see later on this review, Fury X really is at its best - and at its most competitive - at UHD. Our solution? To carry out the Crysis test at both 1440p and 4K on both Fury X and GTX 980 Ti, so it\\'s lucky that our brand new 4K, 60Hz DisplayPort 1.2 capture solution came online just in time for the occasion.\\n\\nIt is worth bearing in mind that 4K is a 4x increment in pixel count over 1080p, and a 2.25x boost over 1440p. Driving that sort of resolution on top-end quality settings is fool\\'s errand: something has to give, so at UHD we drop down from Crysis 3\\'s very high quality preset to high. Suffice to say that it reduces GPU overhead massively. As is often the case when ultra settings are dropped down just one notch, there\\'s only a limited impact on image quality, and that\\'s mostly unseen in the thick of the action. To add some spice to the proceedings, we also add the GTX 980 Ti to the mix, operating at exactly the same settings.\\n\\nThe end result? Well, 60fps can\\'t be sustained at either of our quality setting/resolution combos but it\\'s clear that it\\'s the GTX 980 Ti that gets closer to the target. We\\'d need to drop down to medium to sustain something closer to 60fps at 4K, which strongly suggests to us that even the latest \\'uber\\' GPUs don\\'t have the plumbing to drive UHD displays with gameplay fast enough to match the typical 60Hz refresh.\\n\\nFury X and GTX 980 Ti compared in Crysis 3 as we aim - with only limited success - to drive 60fps at 1440p on very high settings, and 4K at the high preset.\\n\\nCrysis 3 V-Sync Gameplay R9 Fury X 1440p GTX 980 Ti 1440p R9 Fury X 4K GTX 980 Ti 4K Lowest Frame-Rate 40.0fps 44.0fps 28.0fps 30.0fps Dropped Frames (from 18650 total) 1141 (6.12%) 624 (3.35%) 5320 (28.53%) 3626 (19.44%)\\n\\nOrder the graphics cards tested against the R9 390 from Amazon, with free shipping:\\n\\nBut this is just one game, one experience. To get an idea of what Fury X is capable of across more modern titles, it\\'s time to break out the benchmarks, based on the Fury X paired with a Core i7 4790K system overclocked to 4.6GHz, matched with 16GB of 1600MHz DDR3 and running from a Crucial SSD. We usually start our tests at 1080p and scale up from there, but starting at 4K is perhaps the more logical approach - and it\\'s certainly where AMD is most competitive. Similar to the Crysis 4K gameplay test, we knock down all games by one \\'notch\\' from maximum, in an attempt to remove the worst of the diminishing returns found on ultra-level settings.\\n\\nOut of the nine games, AMD musters four wins over the 980 Ti. Three of them - Ryse, Far Cry and Shadow of Mordor - aren\\'t really that much of a surprise. These titles always seem to run faster on AMD\\'s hardware (the result, we suspect, of console GCN optimisations feeding through to PC GCN hardware). Titles like The Witcher 3 and Call of Duty only show a small advantage to Nvidia, but Battlefield 4 sees the 980 Ti storm ahead, dominating by over 19 per cent - the biggest margin of the lot.\\n\\nIs 4GB of VRAM enough? There\\'s a simple rule of thumb developers have been telling us for years now - when it comes to making a GPU purchase, the more VRAM you have onboard and the faster it is, the better. This puts AMD in a difficult position with the R9 Fury X. HBM is expensive, and while it\\'s ultra-fast, current designs are limited to 4GB of RAM. Meanwhile, Nvidia ships the GTX 980 Ti with 6GB of GDDR5, while AMD\\'s own R9 390 and 390X have a colossal 8GB of onboard memory. The question is whether 4GB is enough, or if current and future titles need more. Our benchmarks typically omit multi-sampling anti-aliasing (a traditionally large drain on memory) so across 1080p, 1440p and 4K, we don\\'t tend to see anything above 4GB of RAM making much in the way of difference right now. In future, that might be entirely different, of course. However, one of our tests does indeed push memory to the limits - Assassin\\'s Creed Unity, running at 4K on very high settings with FXAA. And here\\'s where we see some interesting data. Click on the images in this sidebar, and note the latency spikes on the red and orange lines (the rectangular drops on the right graph) representing the Fury X and the R9 290X - the only 4GB cards in the comparison. Then note the lack of such spikes on the R9 390X and GTX 980 Ti, both of which have much more than 4GB of RAM. If there\\'s a smoking gun here, it\\'s that we are running 290X and 390X on the same driver - that\\'s the same hardware effectively, the only difference coming from clock-speed and VRAM allocation. If more VRAM wasn\\'t helpful here, we should expect the R9 390X to stutter just like the Fury X and the 290X, but it doesn\\'t. This may be indicative that VRAM - or lack of it - is the culprit for the latency spikes we do see, even though the Fury X has delta compression technology that the 290X lacks, which should help to make its 4GB go further. Right now, we feel that 4GB isn\\'t a deal-breaker for the Fury X - most games fit within that allocation relatively comfortably as the benchmarks attest, though we do shy away from Shadow of Mordor\\'s ultra textures (as the developer does not recommend them for sub-6GB cards). However, based on our discussions with developers, we feel that VRAM utilisation is only moving in one direction - upwards - and that\\'s a consequence of the lavish amount of unified memory available on the current generation of consoles dictating the trend of development. As one well-placed developer told us recently: \"The harder we push the hardware and the higher quality and the higher res the assets, the more memory we\\'ll need and the faster we\\'ll want it to be. Our games currently in development are hitting memory limits on the consoles left, right and centre now - so memory optimisation is on my list pretty much constantly.\"\\n\\nHowever, once overclocking is factored in, the GTX 980 Ti is back in the game on all of our test games, increasing its lead or getting very, very close against the titles that favour AMD hardware. We could add 200MHz to the core clock and 400MHz to the RAM on the Nvidia card, where we were stable on our most stringent overclocking stress tests. Fury X has no memory overclocking (AMD tells us that it is pointless, even if you could do it) but you should be able to up the core by 90-100MHz in many titles. However, the card consistently failed our stress tests - we were finally stable at 1113MHz (a six per cent boost via AMD Overdrive), just 63MHz over the base clock.\\n\\nAt 3840x2160 - 4K resolution - It\\'s a very close battle between Fury X and GTX 980 Ti. It\\'s where the AMD card is at its most competitive, beating 980 Ti on four games out of the nine we test.\\n\\n3840x2160 (4K) R9 390X GTX 980 Titan X GTX 980 Ti GTX 980 Ti OC R9 Fury X R9 Fury X OC The Witcher 3, High, HairWorks Off, Custom AA 29.1 27.7 37.5 36.9 40.7 36.2 37.6 Battlefield 4, High, Post-AA 44.5 46.8 61.3 61.0 69.6 51.0 52.5 Crysis 3, High, SMAA 40.2 39.0 52.4 52.5 59.7 49.2 51.1 Assassin\\'s Creed Unity, Very High, FXAA 22.7 21.8 27.4 26.5 29.0 25.3 26.7 Far Cry 4, Very High, SMAA 44.4 36.1 46.7 47.1 50.9 50.5 50.5 COD Advanced Warfare, Console Settings, FXAA 76.4 72.0 90.8 86.9 96.9 85.3 88.0 Ryse: Son of Rome, Normal, SMAA 37.8 31.5 42.2 41.7 45.6 44.0 45.7 Shadow of Mordor, High, High Textures, FXAA 50.1 42.4 54.8 54.8 59.7 55.5 57.1 Tomb Raider, Ultra, FXAA 51.4 47.1 64.6 61.3 66.0 63.9 66.8\\n\\nBased on our initial Crysis 3 test, there\\'s a pretty strong argument that 2560x1440 resolution - not 4K - is perhaps the natural home of this new breed of high-end GPU. If we can run Crytek\\'s scalable title on max settings at something approaching a locked 60fps, that\\'s a very strong statement - we can move up to the ultra presets we couldn\\'t achieve at 4K, and in titles where gameplay can\\'t match the 60Hz refresh of the display, we can strategically tweak settings to increase frame-rates without losing that much in the way of image quality.\\n\\nWhat immediately becomes obvious is that the competitiveness of the Fury X begins to slip. It only beats 980 Ti on two of the titles we test here: there\\'s a useful 4.6 per cent boost on Far Cry 4, but Ryse is only 0.3 per cent faster - that\\'s margin of error stuff. Shadow of Mordor, Assassin\\'s Creed Unity and Crysis 3 show fairly close results between the two cards, with GTX 980 Ti between four to six points clear over the AMD challenger. However, The Witcher 3, Battlefield 4 and Advanced Warfare are all at least 17 per cent faster on Nvidia\\'s competing hardare.\\n\\nBut what\\'s fascinating here is the extent to which Nvidia\\'s overclocking yields dividends. With our stable speed increases in place on both products, the gains on the GTX 980 Ti are eye-opening. On the AMD side, gains are minimal and in the case of Assassin\\'s Creed Unity, there\\'s a slight drop, albeit one in the margin of error. As you\\'ll see when the focus shifts to 1080p, the trend seems to be that Fury X is competitive at 4K, but loses its edge the lower the rendering resolution.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to get an excellent 60fps experience from this new wave of graphics cards, we think that a 2560x1440 monitor is the best option right now, preferably one with FreeSync or G-Sync. However, at this resolution, Fury X is not as competitive as its Nvidia counterpart.\\n\\n2560x1440 (1440p) R9 390X GTX 980 Titan X GTX 980 Ti GTX 980 Ti OC R9 Fury X R9 Fury X OC The Witcher 3, Ultra, HairWorks Off, Custom AA 43.5 47.5 63.3 61.7 70.9 52.4 54.3 Battlefield 4, Ultra, 4x MSAA 54.5 57.0 76.1 75.0 86.7 62.2 64.6 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA 52.3 50.0 68.0 66.2 75.7 63.4 65.4 Assassin\\'s Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 38.4 39.7 49.6 48.3 54.4 45.8 45.4 Far Cry 4, Ultra, SMAA 69.0 61.3 77.0 75.4 86.9 78.9 78.9 COD Advanced Warfare, Extra, FSMAA 94.7 98.2 123.2 121.3 139.4 103.0 105.6 Ryse: Son of Rome, High, SMAA 62.2 54.1 72.8 71.2 83.3 71.4 73.0 Shadow of Mordor, Ultra, High Textures, FXAA 74.4 66.0 87.2 87.2 101.8 82.5 86.4 Tomb Raider, Ultimate, FXAA 75.6 76.7 101.9 99.2 117.2 91.6 95.7\\n\\nLet\\'s be clear - Fury X and GTX 980 Ti aren\\'t really designed for 1080p gaming, and it\\'s where we saw the most disappointing returns over lower level cards in both our Titan X and 980 Ti reviews. However, although results were not as high as we hoped, there were still some clear and obvious gains with Titan X and GTX 980 Ti, and there are some practical applications for throwing a ton of GPU power at a full HD display - 120Hz gaming and stereoscopy, for example.\\n\\nWhile there is some scalability in Fury X, it\\'s safe to say that the R9 390X is the better bet if you\\'re after an AMD card designed for 1080p gameplay. The GTX 980 Ti is faster than Fury X in every game we tested, and remarkably the non-Ti 980 - a much cheaper card - is competitive on The Witcher 3, Battlefield 4, Assassin\\'s Creed Unity and Call of Duty. The 980 Ti is 23 to 33 per cent faster in The Witcher 3, Battlefield 4, Far Cry 4 and Advanced Warfare. Remarkably, Far Cry 4 is actually a touch slower on the Fury X than it is at 1440p - margin of error stuff perhaps, but this may suggest that the GPU hardware is not the bottleneck. On several titles, R9 390X gets very, very close too - in Call of Duty, for example. These strange results are actually one of the reasons why this review is a little late. We had to re-assess and re-bench the data. We did it several times, because it just didn\\'t look right, but the same results kept coming back.\\n\\nWe can only speculate as to the reasons why, but data from the excellent hardware.info - who went the extra mile and benched at both medium and ultra settings at full HD - confirms what we see here. Whether it\\'s down to AMD\\'s well-known issues with its DX11 API overhead, or whether the Fiji hardware design simply works better with higher resolutions, the R9 Fury X simply doesn\\'t favour gameplay at 1080p.\\n\\nIt\\'s safe to say that Fury X\\'s 1080p performance is disappointing. You can make the case that the card isn\\'t made for 1080p gaming, but regardless, we shouldn\\'t see GTX 980 Ti command this much of an advantage and it doesn\\'t explain how R9 390X and GTX 980 can challenge it in several titles.\\n\\n1920x1080 (1080p) R9 390X GTX 980 Titan X GTX 980 Ti GTX 980 Ti OC R9 Fury X R9 Fury X OC The Witcher 3, Ultra, HairWorks Off, Custom AA 57.4 65.8 84.4 82.6 92.1 67.1 70.2 Battlefield 4, Ultra, 4x MSAA 78.3 86.5 112.4 109.9 125.4 86.9 89.9 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA 80.1 81.5 105.2 104.0 115.5 94.3 96.8 Assassin\\'s Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 56.0 62.4 74.7 74.4 84.3 62.8 65.0 Far Cry 4, Ultra, SMAA 82.4 87.4 101.4 101.2 103.0 75.7 78.5 COD Advanced Warfare, Extra, FSMAA 112.3 128.0 159.9 156.8 173.1 115.1 115.5 Ryse: Son of Rome, High, SMAA 81.8 75.8 99.2 97.8 109.5 85.1 86.0 Shadow of Mordor, Ultra, High Textures, FXAA 101.9 91.7 119.0 118.5 135.4 110.2 113.0 Tomb Raider, Ultimate, FXAA 107.1 118.2 150.1 150.3 168.2 127.4 132.3\\n\\nScalability at lower resolutions is clearly a concern but certainly from an overall hardware perspective, there\\'s much to like about the Fiji chip. First of all, after the significant power consumption of the 390X, we were concerned that an even bigger chip based on the GCN architecture would be even more of an energy hog. But the good news is that the Fury X hands in a substantial performance boost over the 390X and does so using considerably lower amounts of power. This may explain how the water-cooling set-up is able to keep the GPU at very low temperatures. In a hot office at 27 degrees Celsius, with the Fury X running through extended overclock stress tests with PowerTune pushed to its 150 per cent maximum, we didn\\'t notice temperatures exceed anything higher than 64 degrees. In most use-case scenarios, it\\'s ten degrees lower.\\n\\nAnd in more good news, we also found that Fury X is much, much closer to the GTX 980 Ti in terms of power consumption - a great achievement bearing in mind how much praise Nvidia\\'s hardware has received for its efficiency. After the 80-100W gulf we saw between R9 290X and GTX 980, the gap between Fiji and GM200 is just 32W at stock speeds in our tests. With both graphics cards overclocked as far as we could push them, there\\'s just 6W between them - though the GTX 980 Ti is pushing out more frames.\\n\\nThe conclusion we draw from this is positive - our big concern going into Fury X testing was that the water-cooler was there to manage excessive heat, just as it was on the R9 295X2. A hot chip would also have caused problems for the upcoming air-cooled Fury, coming along some time next month. Based on the kind of heat dissipation we saw on the MSI Radeon R9 390X we reviewed, it\\'s our contention that even a fully enabled Fiji processor at the same clocks as Fury X could be cooled by air - though we may need to forego the smaller form factor to accommodate a larger heat sink and fan. By extension, the power efficiency on display in Fury X also suggests that the small form factor 175W Fury Nano should have no thermal problems whatsoever and could still pack quite a kick.\\n\\nIn our overclocking stress-testing, we found that this scene from Crysis 3 incurred a larger power draw than anything we\\'ve previously seen, so we tested Fury X and GTX 980 Ti here on our benchmarking system, though we did remove the overclock from our Core i7 4790K to lessen any spikes in consumption from the CPU.',\n",

       " \"A Mission Viejo man who claims he chewed on a condom in his French onion soup at Claim Jumper in April 2009 will have his case heard in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana beginning Monday.\\n\\nZdenek Philip Hodousek, 51, is seeking unspecified damages and a public apology from the Irvine-based restaurant chain and any vendor associated with making the soup. Hodousek’s lawyer, Eric Traut, said his client was offered a $30,000 settlement by the company, but the case will go to court because Hodousek wants vindication for his “tarnished reputation.”\\n\\nClaim Jumper last year issued a statement denying the validity of the man’s allegations, which is the position the company maintains today.\\n\\n“We have found no evidence to support any of the allegations of a ‘foreign object in the food,” said Joan Gladstone, a spokeswoman for the company in a statement issued Monday. “After a thorough investigation, there was no evidence of any Claim Jumper employee involvement or wrong doing.\\n\\n“We have faith in the jury system and believe we will be vindicated in court,” Gladstone said.\\n\\nAccording to a lawsuit filed in July 2009, Hodousek was eating at the Claim Jumper at Santa Margarita and Marguerite parkways with his family April 12, Easter Sunday.\\n\\nA server brought Hodousek’s soup, which he began to eat.\\n\\n“Suddenly he felt what he believed was tough cheese on one side of his mouth,” the suit reads. “When he could not chew it into pieces, (Hodousek) commented to his family that it felt like rubber. He spit it out, spooned it onto a napkin, at which time his wife said ‘Oh my God, it’s a condom.'”\\n\\nThe suit states the condom had a knot in it, which was later untied by the restaurant’s general manager, Marc Hadley, because he thought it might be a rubber glove. After the knot was untied, it was apparent that the item was a condom.\\n\\nThe meal was complimentary and Hodousek took the condom with him to have it tested. According to the suit, preliminary tests by Lab Corp. in North Carolina found female DNA on the condom.\\n\\nTraut said both Philip Hodousek and his wife Sherry submitted to DNA tests, the results of which did not match the DNA on the condom.\\n\\nTraut said Claim Jumper, which conducted DNA tests of its own employees, has not been forthright in divulging the findings. Gladstone said the company has provided all the test results to Traut.\\n\\nLast July, Hodousek admitted to owing the state and federal governments nearly $300,000 in back taxes and penalties, but said his debt and the restaurant incident are unrelated.\\n\\nTraut said there is no evidence a member of the family planted the condom, or that tax liens would cause his client to do so.\\n\\n“The Hodouseks want their names cleared of any wrongdoing and Claim Jumper is unwilling to make a public statement saying that’s the case,” Traut said. “They’ve lived in this community many years, and their reputation has been tarnished. A verdict in their favor would resolve that.”\\n\\nContact the writer: 949-454-7352 or npirani@ocregister.com\",\n",

       " 'Newly released data from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) appears to show that legalizing marijuana does what advocates have long promised: It reduces the unregulated cannabis market and cuts law enforcement costs.\\n\\nThe DEA allocated exactly zero dollars and zero cents for marijuana eradication in Colorado for Fiscal Year 2016, which is down from the agency’s $80,000 budget line item for the state during Fiscal Year 2014. That’s according to documents released this month in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from journalist Drew Atkins. Colorado voters enacted a marijuana legalization measure in November 2012, and legal sales went into effect in the state on January 1, 2014.\\n\\nWhile Washington State voted to legalize cannabis on the same day in 2012, legal sales there didn’t start until July 2014. But DEA marijuana eradication spending is already down in that state, too, according to the new data. The federal agency spent $1,050,000 chopping down marijuana plants in FY2014 and $950,000 the next year. But for the current fiscal year, only $760,000 is allocated in the budget.\\n\\nIn Oregon, where voters approved legalization in November 2014 and legal sales began about a year later, DEA anti-marijuana spending is down from $1,000,000 in FY2014 to just $200,000 in FY2016. DEA allocated nothing for marijuana eradication for any of the past three fiscal years in Alaska, which also voted to legalize in 2014.\\n\\nWhile the state reductions can’t be directly attributed to the end of cannabis prohibition — some non-legal states have dipped too, while others have increased — the data undermines a common talking point from opponents of legalization who argue that the new laws actually make it easier for drug cartels and gangs to set up shop and undercut the regulated and taxed legal market.\\n\\nIf that were true, one would expect to see federal agencies putting even more emphasis into those states. But the new data shows that in every state that has so far implemented a legal market for marijuana, DEA spending on cannabis eradication is down.\\n\\nThis year, voters in Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada will get a chance to legalize marijuana via questions on their November ballots.\\n\\nPhoto Courtesy of Allie Beckett.',\n",

       " 'The Open Philanthropy Project recommended a grant of $30 million ($10 million per year for 3 years) in general support to OpenAI. This grant initiates a partnership between the Open Philanthropy Project and OpenAI, in which Holden Karnofsky (Open Philanthropy’s Executive Director, “Holden” throughout this page) will join OpenAI’s Board of Directors and, jointly with one other Board member, oversee OpenAI’s safety and governance work.\\n\\nWe expect the primary benefits of this grant to stem from our partnership with OpenAI, rather than simply from contributing funding toward OpenAI’s work. While we would also expect general support for OpenAI to be likely beneficial on its own, the case for this grant hinges on the benefits we anticipate from our partnership, particularly the opportunity to help play a role in OpenAI’s approach to safety and governance issues.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nThis grant falls within our work on potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence (AI), one of our focus areas within global catastrophic risks. We have written in detail about the case we see for funding work related to AI on our blog. As we wrote in that post, we see AI and machine learning research as being on a very short list of the most dynamic, unpredictable, and potentially world-changing areas of science. Broadly, we expect the results of continuing progress in AI research to be positive for society at large, but we see some risks (both from unintended consequences of AI use, and from deliberate misuse), and believe that we - as a philanthropic organization, separate from academia, industry, and government - may be well-placed to support work to reduce those risks.\\n\\nThe organization\\n\\nOpenAI is a non-profit, founded in 2015. Its mission is to build safe AI, and ensure AI’s benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible. Currently, most of its work is on advancing the state of the art in technical AI research.\\n\\nOpenAI’s leadership appears to be highly value-aligned with us; this includes their focus on the societal impacts of AI and their concern about potential risks from advanced AI.\\n\\nWhen OpenAI launched, it characterized the nature of the risks - and the most appropriate strategies for reducing them - in a way that we disagreed with. In particular, it emphasized the importance of distributing AI broadly; our current view is that this may turn out to be a promising strategy for reducing potential risks, but that the opposite may also turn out to be true (for example, if it ends up being important for institutions to keep some major breakthroughs secure to prevent misuse and/or to prevent accidents). Since then, OpenAI has put out more recent content consistent with the latter view, and we are no longer aware of any clear disagreements. However, it does seem that our starting assumptions and biases on this topic are likely to be different from those of OpenAI’s leadership, and we won’t be surprised if there are disagreements in the future.\\n\\nGiven our shared values, different starting assumptions and biases, and mutual uncertainty, we expect partnering with OpenAI to provide a strong opportunity for productive discussion about the best paths to reducing AI risk. We also think the fact that OpenAI and Open Philanthropy are both located in San Francisco, and that some informal relationships already exist between Open Philanthropy and OpenAI personnel, will contribute to productive communication between our organizations.\\n\\nCase for the grant\\n\\nGiven our prioritization of reducing potential risks from advanced AI, we are interested in opportunities to become closely involved with any of the small number of existing organizations in “industry” (i.e. not in academia or government) that (a) are explicitly working toward the development of transformative AI; (b) are advancing the state of the art in AI research; (c) employ top AI research talent. We think it is likely that such organizations will be essential for:\\n\\nCreating an environment in which people can effectively do technical research on “AI safety” (i.e. work toward reducing potential risks from advanced AI). This is especially the case if groups in industry become more important, relative to groups in academia, as AI progress continues.\\n\\nRaising the general profile and legitimacy of work to reduce AI risk.\\n\\nHelping to shape discussions about policy and strategic considerations if and when it appears that transformative AI could be developed soon.\\n\\nWe see OpenAI and DeepMind as the two organizations currently best fitting the above description (based in large part on the views of our technical advisors). (We think it is possible that Vicarious may also fit this description, but do not feel we have enough information to be confident; in particular, Vicarious makes public substantially less information about its research and its progress than either OpenAI or DeepMind.)\\n\\nWe believe that close involvement with such an organization is likely one of the most effective avenues available to us for advancing our goal of increasing the amount of work done on reducing potential risks from advanced AI, both within the organization and outside it (the latter via increased legitimacy for safety-focused work and improved career options for leading thinkers interested in pursuing AI research that’s focused on safety). We also expect such a partnership to:\\n\\nImprove our understanding of the field of AI research, and give us a better sense of which interventions are most likely to be effective for reducing risks.\\n\\nImprove our ability to generically achieve our goals regarding technical AI safety research, particularly by helping us form relationships with top researchers in the field.\\n\\nBetter position us to generally promote the ideas and goals that we prioritize within AI.\\n\\nAs stated in the previous section, we think a partnership with OpenAI is particularly appealing due to our shared values, different starting assumptions and biases, and potential for productive communication.\\n\\nAs our views and OpenAI’s views evolve (regarding the most promising paths to reducing potential risks from advanced AI), it is likely that both we and OpenAI will be putting out further public content to share our thinking.\\n\\nDetails on Open Philanthropy’s role\\n\\nHolden plans to visit OpenAI roughly once a week for all-hands and other meetings. Preliminarily, he expects to generally be an advocate for:\\n\\nEncouraging work on alignment research, to the extent that there is promising work to be done.\\n\\nIntensive analysis of potential future policy challenges with respect to AI (we expect to publish more on this topic in the future).\\n\\nFocusing on high-quality basic research.\\n\\nWe also believe we are well-positioned to help improve connections between OpenAI and groups in the risk-focused AI community, such as the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) (which is also an Open Philanthropy grantee).\\n\\nA note on why this grant is larger than others we’ve recommended in this focus area\\n\\nWe expect that some readers will be surprised by the size of this grant, and wonder why it is so much larger than grants we’ve recommended to other groups working on potential risks from advanced AI. We think it would be prohibitively difficult to communicate our full thinking on this matter, but a few notes:\\n\\nAs we’ve written previously, we consider this cause to be an outstanding one, and we are generally willing to invest a lot for a relatively small chance of very large impact.\\n\\nWe think this cause will be disproportionately important if it turns out that transformative AI is developed sooner than expected (within 20 years, or perhaps even sooner). And if that happens, we think it’s fairly likely that OpenAI will be an extraordinarily important organization, with far more influence over how things play out than organizations that focus exclusively on risk reduction and do not advance the state of the art.\\n\\nWe generally feel it is very hard to make predictions about, and plans for, 10+ years from now. We think that working closely with OpenAI will put us in much better position to understand and react to a wide variety of potential situations, and that this is much more likely to result in the kind of impact we’re looking for than supporting any particular line of research (or other intervention targeting a specific scenario and specific risk) today.\\n\\nIn fact, much of our other work in this cause aims primarily to help build a general field and culture that can react to a wide variety of potential future situations, and prioritizes this goal above supporting any particular line of research. We think that OpenAI’s importance to the field of AI as a whole makes this partnership an excellent opportunity for that goal as well.\\n\\nWe are often hesitant to provide too high a proportion of a given organization’s funding, for a number of reasons. OpenAI has significant sources of revenue other than Open Philanthropy, and we are comfortable with the overall proportion of funding we are providing. (This is less true of other grantees in this space to date.)\\n\\nPlans for learning and follow-up\\n\\nKey questions for follow-up will include:\\n\\nHas our partnership resulted in concrete differences in OpenAI’s activities and/or changes in our thinking?\\n\\nDoes OpenAI still seem to be one of the few leading AI research groups, in terms of talent and likelihood of making progress toward transformative AI?\\n\\nHow well-aligned are we with OpenAI’s leadership on key issues relating to potential risks from advanced AI?\\n\\nWe plan to do informal reviews each year. We currently plan to do a more in-depth review to consider further renewal at the end of this three-year term. The key questions for renewal will be whether OpenAI appears to be a significant positive force for reducing potential risks from advanced AI, and/or whether our involvement is tangibly helping OpenAI move towards becoming a positive force for AI safety.\\n\\nOur process\\n\\nOpenAI initially approached Open Philanthropy about potential funding for safety research, and we responded with the proposal for this grant. Subsequent discussions included visits to OpenAI’s office, conversations with OpenAI’s leadership, and discussions with a number of other organizations (including safety-focused organizations and AI labs), as well as with our technical advisors.\\n\\nRelationship disclosures\\n\\nOpenAI researchers Dario Amodei and Paul Christiano are both technical advisors to Open Philanthropy and live in the same house as Holden. In addition, Holden is engaged to Dario’s sister Daniela.\\n\\nSources',\n",
       " 'At a remarkable conference held at the Aspen Institute in 2011, General Michael Hayden, a former head of both the NSA and the CIA, said something very interesting. In a discussion of how to secure the \"critical infrastructure\" of the United States he described the phenomenon of compromised computer hardware – namely, chips that have hidden \"back doors\" inserted into them at the design or manufacturing stage – as \"the problem from hell\". And, he went on, \"frankly, it\\'s not a problem that can be solved\".\\n\\nNow General Hayden is an engaging, voluble, likable fellow. He\\'s popular with the hacking crowd because he doesn\\'t talk like a government suit. But sometimes one wonders if his agreeable persona is actually a front for something a bit more disingenuous. Earlier in the Aspen discussion, for example, he talked about the Stuxnet worm – which was used to destroy centrifuges in the Iranian nuclear programme – as something that was obviously created by a nation-state, but affected not to know that the US was one of the nation-states involved.\\n\\nGiven Hayden\\'s background and level of security clearance, it seems inconceivable that he didn\\'t know who built Stuxnet. So already one had begun to take his contributions with a modicum of salt. Nevertheless, his observation about the intractability of the problem of compromised hardware seemed incontrovertible. This is because covertly modified hardware is hard to detect – much more so than dodgy software. The hardware in a computer can do things like access data in ways that are completely invisible even to the machine\\'s security software. At the Black Hat security conference in August last year, for example, a researcher named Jonathan Brossard demonstrated software that can be burned into the hardware of a PC, creating a back door that would allow secret remote access over the internet. And – here\\'s the really scary bit – the secret entrance couldn\\'t even be closed by switching off the computer\\'s hard disk or reinstalling its operating system.\\n\\nThe reason this is so scary is because virtually every bit of kit that runs the internet – the machine on which you compose your emails, the tablet or smartphone with which you browse the net, the routers that pass on the data packets that comprise your email or your web search, everything – is a computer. So the thought that all this stuff might covertly be compromised in ways that are impossible to detect is terrifying. It\\'s this fear that underpins American (and British) reservations about network products made by the Chinese company Huawei – the suspicions (vehemently denied by Huawei, of course) that the kit has secret back doors installed in it to facilitate the Chinese\\'s cyber-army\\'s penetration of western networks.\\n\\nSo Hayden was right: it is a problem from hell. If the hardware that runs the internet has been polluted or infiltrated then we\\'re all screwed, because there\\'s no bit of cyberspace you can trust. And I know, I know: it sounds like paranoia – until you discover that Darpa, the research arm of the US department of defence (DoD), has launched a massive research project into compromised hardware.\\n\\nThe department\\'s growing dependence on the global supply chain, it says, \"makes device, software and firmware security an imperative. Back doors, malicious software and other vulnerabilities unknown to the user could enable an adversary to use a device to accomplish a variety of harmful objectives, including the exfiltration [extraction] of sensitive data and the sabotage of critical operations. Determining the security of every device DoD uses in a timely fashion is beyond current capabilities.\"\\n\\nAt this point we enter a Kafkaesque world of smoke and mirrors. Because one of the most obvious inferences from the Snowden revelations published by the Guardian, New York Times and ProPublica recently is that the NSA has indeed been up to the business of inserting covert back doors in networking and other computing kit.\\n\\nThe reports say that, in addition to undermining all of the mainstream cryptographic software used to protect online commerce, the NSA has been \"collaborating with technology companies in the United States and abroad to build entry points into their products\".\\n\\nThese reports have, needless to say, been strenuously denied by the companies, such as Cisco, that make this networking kit. Perhaps the NSA omitted to tell Darpa what it was up to? In the meantime, I hear that some governments have decided that their embassies should no longer use electronic communications at all, and are returning to employing couriers who travel the world handcuffed to locked dispatch cases. We\\'re back to the future, again.',\n",
       " \"Local smartphone makers in India with aggressively low prices are outselling worldwide market leaders Apple and Samsung, according to new data.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sales are being driven by first-time smartphone buyers in India, according to a report published Friday by Bloomberg. The big winners have been Karbonn Mobiles India Pvt. and Micromax Informatics Ltd., which have priced their handsets below 4,000 rupees, or about $73 U.S.In contrast, Apple's flagship iPhone 5 starts at 45,500 rupees, a price that's exceptionally high because mobile providers in India do not provide handset subsidies. Meanwhile, Samsung's Galaxy Grand is available in India for 21,500 rupees.In a separate report filed on Friday by The Times of India, it was also noted that sales of Apple's legacy iPhone 4 \\x97 a device that first launched in 2010 \\x97 are currently outpacing the iPhone 5 in India. Sales have reportedly tripled over the last week after Apple began offering a discount of at least 7,000 rupees for customers who trade in any smartphone in exchange for an iPhone 4.With that discount, customers can get an iPhone 4 for less than 20,000 rupees. But even at that discounted price, Apple is still well above the low-end competitors in India that are currently dominating sales.The popularity of low-priced options in markets like India, China and Brazil, where contract subsidies are not common, has helped to drive speculation that Apple could release a new iPhone model with a lower price to address those markets. Reports have suggested that Apple plans to launch a low-cost iPhone model later this year made of a plastic shell to reduce costs.However, it's unlikely that Apple would hit price points as low as Karbonn and Micromax are currently offering in India. Market watchers instead expect that Apple could offer an unsubsidized low-cost iPhone model for between $250 and $300\",\n",
       " 'Congressional Democrats renewed their push this week to get financial regulators to issue a rule requiring all publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending.\\n\\nReps. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.) and Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) led a coalition of 58 lawmakers in writing a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairwoman Mary Jo White calling again for a formal rule.\\n\\n“As you know, the 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, opened the floodgates on unlimited and unchecked corporate spending on political communication and campaign advertisements,” the lawmakers’ letter said. “This paradigm poses a fundamental threat to our democracy, which is hobbled by unaccountable corporate special interests drowning out the voices of everyday citizens.”\\n\\nSenate Democrats on the Banking Committee also sent a letter to the SEC this week in support of a disclosure rule.\\n\\nPublic Citizen’s Congress Watch division, an advocate for the rule, said the SEC has received more than 1.2 million public comments in favor of political spending disclosures. Advocates include leading academics in the field of securities law, investment managers and advisers, 70 major endowed foundations, Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, and a number of state treasurers.\\n\\n“In the pursuit of good corporate governance and a new commissioner who puts Main Street first, we heartily agree with the case made by the banking committee senators,” Lisa Gilbert, the group’s director said in a news release. “Support for a rule requiring disclosure of corporate political spending should serve as a metric for a qualified nominee, and the outcry for this rule by investors must no longer be ignored.\"',\n",
       " 'Matt Coffay, a grassroots organizer and former farmer, is hoping to lead a progressive wave of change in Western North Carolina. This past weekend, he announced his intent to challenge U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows for the state\\'s 11th House district seat.\\n\\nAt a rally Tuesday outside the Henderson County Courthouse hosted by Progressive Organized Women, Coffay told a crowd of about 100 that during the campaign, he won\\'t spend all his time on the phone tying himself to big donors and their interests. Instead of building his campaign on the maximum personal donations of $2,700, he said, he\\'ll be looking for donations of $27.\\n\\nInfrastructure, jobs, education and health care were the focus of his remarks. Coffay says he supports a $15 minimum wage, health care for all, free public college and investment in infrastructure and jobs.\\n\\nA native of Blue Ridge, Ga., 30-year-old Coffay traveled around some after college, he said, but has been back home in Southern Appalachia for the past decade.\\n\\nFor the past few years, he\\'s been a full-time farmer, working 80 hours a week to grow a variety of vegetables on a small farm for direct sales to consumers and restaurants. He\\'s now with the National Young Farmers\\' Coalition, where he works with chapters nationwide to advance federal policy to make it easier for young people to become farmers.\\n\\nBasically there\\'s an agriculture crisis across the nation, Coffay said. The average age of American farmers is now 60 years old, continuing an upward trend that\\'s not showing any signs of turning around.\\n\\nHe started the local chapter of OurRevolution, a progressive political organization that formed after the presidential election. The chapter, OurRevolutionAVL, out of Asheville, grew quickly. Coffay said he\\'s been told by national organizers that it has developed into one of the top two or three largest and most active chapters in the country.\\n\\nWhen the organization got to the point where it was looking for candidates to run for local office, he was approached as a good choice for the 11th, thanks to his background as a young farmer and being a native of the area and a good organizer.\\n\\nAt first, Coffay said he laughed at the \"preposterous\" idea, but the more he thought about it, the more he felt that a person like him is exactly what the country needs in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nCongress is mostly populated by rich lawyers, he said, something the vast majority of the nation is not. Half the country earns less than $15 an hour, he said, and what\\'s needed in Congress are people who understand what it\\'s like to work really hard and want to fight on behalf of the working class.\\n\\nLast Sunday, at a rally promoting Medicare for All, Coffay officially announced that he\\'ll be running on the Democratic ticket against Meadows in 2018. He hopes to unseat the congressman, who has quickly gained traction in Washington and wields influence as the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\\n\\nMeadows during his time in Washington has been credited with shutting down the government and stopping the American Health Care Act, the recent Republican bid to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\\n\\nCoffay\\'s encouraged, however, by the recent special elections in Kansas and Georgia, where Democratic candidates gained ground in traditionally Republican districts. He said he hopes the same factors fueling those campaigns can help his candidacy gain steam in the deeply red NC-11.\\n\\nIn Georgia, John Ossoff, another 30-year-old Democratic congressional hopeful, just won 48 percent of the vote in a special election, almost crossing the 50-percent threshold that would have prevented a June runoff. In Kansas, Democratic candidate Jim Thompson faced a similar situation, losing to Republican Kansas State Treasurer Ron Estes by just six points.\\n\\nAnother race Coffay mentioned is the Montana special election for the House, where Democratic candidate Rob Quist is gaining momentum and funding.\\n\\nAll three races were caused by President Donald Trump appointing the Republican incumbent to administration posts, and Coffay says all three are interesting.\\n\\n\"All three races demonstrate that all bets are off at this point,\" Coffay said, noting that the midterms following a presidential election tend to favor the opposing party. But with Trump and Meadows, Coffay sees special cases.\\n\\nLast November, Meadows handily defeated his Democratic opponent, Rick Bryson, 64 percent to 36 percent. In 2014, Meadows defeated his previous opponent, Tom Hill, by just a slightly smaller margin: 63 percent to 37 percent.\\n\\nBut in 2018, Coffay he aims to boost voter turnout, and has veteran team members who have worked on congressional campaigns around the country and in the South. Staff members are already working to make connections with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\\n\\nHe noted that the DCCC did not get behind Thompson in his race, though he still performed well, but the DCCC did get behind Ossof, who nearly won the special election outright. The Montana race is somewhere in between.\\n\\nIf the DCCC wants to get involved in a conservative district in a southern congressional race, Coffay says this is a good one to get involved in, but he\\'s not sure if the committee will want to back such a progressive candidate.\\n\\nThere\\'s potential for big funding, according to consultants and others the campaign has talked to, Coffay said, depending on how the campaign does over the next year. That\\'s what the campaign is banking on — a successful grassroots campaign, and if they can be successful there, larger forces may come into play.\\n\\nCoffay says he intends to raise more than $1 million, which would eclipse the $48,000 raised by Bryson and the $15,300 raised by Hill, according to Federal Elections Commission filings. In the two-year period from Jan. 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016, the FEC shows Meadows reported about $659,000 in receipts.\\n\\n\"What we need is massive infrastructure investment\" in Western North Carolina, Coffay said, to bring immediate benefit to the people and create long-term jobs. He specifically mentioned the lack of broadband in rural areas, asking how one can expect large businesses to want to come to an area without even internet.\\n\\n\"Also, when it comes to jobs, we need to stand up and say loudly and clearly, \\'It\\'s time to raise the minimum wage,\\'\" he said. He called the current rate of $7.25 an hour a \"starvation wage,\" and said the minimum wage should be raised to $15 per hour.\\n\\nAs for education, Coffay says North Carolina\\'s per-pupil spending is abysmal and schools that are underfunded can\\'t be expected to perform well. Something also has to be done about college affordability, he said. If the wealthiest people in the country start paying their fair share, there\\'s no reason the country can\\'t have tuition-free public college, he added.\\n\\nWhen it comes to health care, Meadows is taking the wrong approach, Coffay says.\\n\\n\"At the end of the day, what everybody needs is just quality, affordable health care,\" he said.\\n\\nPeople like Meadows think that deregulating the health insurance industry will somehow make insurance very affordable, Coffay said, calling that approach absurd because the health care marketplace doesn\\'t follow the same laws of economics that other markets like automobiles do, because the demand for healthcare is unlimited. He pushes for a single-payer, Medicare-for-all system.\\n\\n\"The moral thing to do is to guarantee health care for everybody,\" regardless of background or income, he said.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, the debate about repeal and replace needs to go a different direction, he said, toward single-payer. He cited a May 2016 Gallup poll showing that 58 percent of respondents said they would favor replacing the ACA with a federally funded health care program providing insurance for all Americans. Thirty-seven percent said they would oppose such a measure.',\n",
       " 'An international destination music festival needs to be something really special these days to standout from the glut of events that dot the globe each summer. This week alone there are fests kicking off in Croatia, France, Switzerland and Belgium.\\n\\nBut the Secret Solstice Festival in Iceland has it wired; they promote an experience where the sun doesn’t set for three-days during the summer solstice. Add that in with dozens of acts from multiple countries, and organizers have a leg up on the competition, with Reykjavík the northernmost capital in the world and only one able to pull off such a boast.\\n\\nNow in its second year, this past weekend’s Secret Solstice has expanded, ironed out some of the wrinkles and gotten lucky with the weather. While the inaugural event in 2014 suffered from haze and clouds that put a slight damper on the overall atmosphere, this year’s planning had some options in addition to the music which took advantage of the unique landscape.\\n\\nThe big one was the world’s first ever rave inside of a glacier. Seventy lucky revelers headed to the man-made tourist attraction which opened earlier this month. Naturally dubbed the IceRave, there were DJ sets by electronic artists Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs and Artwork deep inside the cavern of ice. Drinks were served, a maximum of two, because this isn’t some club you can stumble in and out of; you’re traveling on a 20 ton vehicle just to get across the slick territory, heading some 1600 feet deep into ice, strapping crampons on your existing footwear, and getting a tour of one of the most gorgeous aspects of nature on the planet.\\n\\nBack on the Secret Solstice site, the weather was strikingly cooperative, with the sun shining at full blast more often than not. In addition to the two major stages, DJ heavy club sections, multitude of restaurants and vendors peddling local wares – and even a nine foot high hot tub overlooking the main stage available for rent – there was a “secret lagoon party” Friday at midnight in the town of Flúðir which boasts the oldest geothermal pool in Iceland, built in the late 1800s which featured a disco set by Skream, Zero 7, Los Angeles based Droog and Sexy Lazer.\\n\\nA hangover party was held on Sunday at Laugardalslaugin, the swimming pool next to the festival. It featured RVK Soundsystem, a local DJ collective whose goal is, “to present reggae music to the Icelandic public and build a strong scene around the genre.”\\n\\nSpeaking of, the music itself wasn’t so bad either. Following in the vein of last year, it was hip-hop, trip-hop and electronic heavy with the barely controlled chaos of Wu-Tang Clan as event headliners, FKA twigs, Kelis and Hercules & Love Affair among the most anticipated at the top or near the top of the bill each day, all delivering solid performances. Saturday had a “secret headliner” who turned out to be Busta Rhymes, which pretty much surprised no one in attendance as it had been all but confirmed by that morning. The Wailers, Charles Bradley and Nightmares on Wax also drew large crowds as the days wore on.\\n\\nOne act on the bill that many were curious about was Bam Margera’s Earth Rocker, a name derived from a 2013 Clutch album. Formerly known as Fuckface Unstoppable, the musical art project/metal/dubstep shitshow features songs like “Beers Drugs & Bitches” and “Bend My Dick” (sample lyric: “I wanna bend my dick to my ass/so I can fuck myself”). It’s hard to tell if it’s a joke, though that’s what one would hope as it would seem an awful lot of trouble for the Jackass star to travel all that way to perform (while seeming incredibly inebriated) to a pathetically sparse audience on a tiny stage if it was in sincerity.\\n\\nFollowing the gig, Margera ended up getting knocked out during a scuffle he admittedly started in the media and artist backstage area. Reports are conflicting about whether Bam was under the influence during the throw-down, though it’s been confirmed the perpetrators of the KO were Iceland’s rap crew Glacier Mafia. And if that isn’t embarrassing enough, Margera showed up at the police station to press charges, but then split because it was taking too long.\\n\\nIn fact, the only main problem with destination festivals like this is the drunken American stereotype which is repeatedly on display. Whether it was loudly arguing onsite with bartenders over the temperature of their beer (served warm) or post-fest in the city at an establishment demanding those in attendance give a standing ovation for the dude who just played a barely tolerable acoustic version of Radiohead’s “Creep,” it’s sometimes hard not to argue with the “Yankee go home” line of thinking. Sometimes, it might be better if certain festivals actually were kept a secret.\\n\\nFollow Michael Christopher around the world and on Twitter @BlackBranchMC',\n",
       " 'ILIGAN CITY — President Rodrigo Duterte revealed on Friday that the Maute Group fighting government troops in Marawi City was founded by two brothers (Abdullah and Omar Maute) who were former police officers involved in illegal drugs.\\n\\n“They were policemen in Manila who got enamored with the money of shabu,” he said. “Umuwi dito (They returned here) and established one of the biggest factories of shabu in Lanao del Sur,” Duterte said in a speech before soldiers at the multi-purpose hall of the Army’s 2nd Mechanized Infantry Brigade.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nHe said money from the drugs trade was used “to fuel the movement.”\\n\\nAwash with cash, the brothers were able to recruit followers, and according to the President, got hold of locally-sourced weapons, turning the former drug gang into the government’s “formidable enemy.”\\n\\nThrough the Maute Group, Duterte said the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq (ISIS), the international terror group which has waged a brutal war in the Middle East, was able to enter the country.\\n\\n“You can say that ISIS is here already,” he said, pointing out that the group had been using the black flag of ISIS.\\n\\nSome of the members, however, might have just went along for other reasons; Maybe they were disgruntled followers of some politicians or they might be angry with the government.\\n\\nHe said the Maute Group even “imported” Isnilon Hapilon, a sub-leader of the bandit group Abu Sayyaf, whom the ISIS had anointed as its “emir” or leader in the Philippines.\\n\\n“So that’s our problem,” Duterte told the soldiers.“ And you’re going to fight. You have to fight every day until this conflict is resolved. I could only pray for you.”\\n\\n“I will pray for you and I will answer for everything,” he added, even expressing his willingness to join them into battle “if only I could.”\\n\\n“Huwag kayong mag-alala. You can arrest any person. Search any house. Kagaya noon,” Duterte said.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe President also told troops not to worry about possible consequences and ramifications in the implementation of martial rule.\\n\\n“I and I alone would be responsible,” the President said. “I’m a leader. I’m supposed to lead the way. If you go down, I go down.”\\n\\nHe also pledged to put all the necessary military assets at the troops’ disposal.\\n\\n“I’m scraping the bottom of the barrel to look for money to see you through,” he said. “I’ll give you all you need. Just wait for the new firearms.”\\n\\nIn the meantime, he said: “We have the weapons and the equipment and we have the air assets to help you.”\\n\\nDuterte also emphasized the need to minimize collateral damage.\\n\\n“Because if people are against us, medyo mahirapan tayo (we might face some difficulty),” he said. “If we can only inflict damage on those who want to fight and contain the fire fights between combatants, that would be the best solution.”\\n\\nWhile ordering a no-mercy stance against those who resist, the President said he was still open for talks with the enemy, particularly those who were not hardcore.\\n\\n“But if they want to talk I would be most grateful to Allah,” he said. “Mag-usap tayo ng kapayapaan (Let’s talk peace).”\\n\\nOn the other hand, he said: “All-out terrorists who can’t be convinced to stop fighting, so be it. Let’s go to war. My order to the troops is whoever has firearm and put up a fight, kill him. Finish them off because it would be the same.

       " 'The Washington Post editorial page (10/5/12) weighed in on the contentious environmental issue of fracking. No surprise–they’re all for it.\\n\\n“Fracking’s Green Side” is the headline in the print edition. (The Web version is different.) The editors write:\\n\\nThose who would ban fracking or regulate it into oblivion ignore the exceptional benefits that inexpensive natural gas can provide in the biggest environmental fight of our time–against climate change.\\n\\nOf course, many people who fight climate change don’t think fracking is the answer. They point to the considerable local environmental hazards–water and air pollution, for starters–but they also question the argument that fracking is necessarily better for the climate.\\n\\nThe Post makes the argument that gas proponents most often cite: “Burning natural gas produces only about half the carbon emissions as burning coal.”\\n\\nBut as fracking critics point out, this is not the only impact it has on the climate. Here’s Neil deMause in Extra! (7/12):\\n\\nAny drilling for fossil fuels means more carbon will eventually be released into the atmosphere, but fracking’s effect on climate is compounded by the fact that the drilling process can create huge methane leaks: A study by Cornell scientists Robert Howarth and Anthony Ingraffea estimated that fracked wells leak 40 to 60 percent more methane than conventional wells (Scientific American, 1/20/12). Because methane is 20 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide, the National Center for Atmospheric Research has estimated that at these levels of leakage, switching from oil to natural gas consumption would significantly worsen global warming over the next several decades (Climate Progress, 9/9/11).\\n\\nThe Post doesn’t mention methane leaks. They do, however, approvingly cite research from a group called Resources for the Future, touting an energy future based on increased fracking. Readers might want to know, but aren’t told, that the group is financially backed by a Who’s Who of the energy industry: Shell, Duke Energy, Chevron, the American Gas Association, ExxonMobil, Alcoa, Dow Chemical and so forth.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, we pointed out that the Post seemed to sell a couple of its news pages to an energy industry sponsor.

However, the Braves say they love the depth in their bullpen, particularly from the left side.\\n\\nVenters appeared in 66 games in 2012, posting a 3.22 ERA with 10.6 K/9 and 4.3 BB/9 in 58 2/3 innings. The 27-year-old has a 2.23 ERA with 10.1 K/9 in three seasons with the Braves. Those numbers earned him a raise to $1.625MM this offseason when he was arbitration eligible for the first time. Venters is under team control through 2015.\\n\\nIf the Braves were to trade Venters they\\'d still have left-handers Eric O\\'Flaherty and Luis Avilan available in the bullpen. Teams such as the Nationals, Tigers and Dodgers could have interest in a reliever of Venters\\' caliber in my view. The Braves could seek a left-handed hitting bench player if they do consider trading Venters.',\n",
       " 'Canadian oil and gas producers happy to see the end of the Obama era are quickly coming to the realization that the imminent Trump presidency could be even more challenging if he moves forward with the adoption of a border adjustment tax.\\n\\nWhile other Canadian sectors have been vocal in condemning the proposal, “no sector … will be more affected than petroleum,” according to Colorado-based energy expert Philip Verleger, who has been studying the recommended U.S. tax code changes since last summer.\\n\\nVerleger, principal of consultancy PKVerleger LLC, believes Canadian exporters of oil and oil products are in for a nasty surprise.\\n\\n“Bluntly speaking, for oil the law’s passage is pure mercantilism. Exporters from Mexico, Canada, and the rest of the world could be shut out,” Verleger writes this week in a report to clients. “As Woody Allen would say, ‘Sorry, suckers’.”\\n\\nThe border tax proposal is part of a tax reform spearheaded by Paul Ryan, speaker of the House of Representatives, and Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\\n\\nUnder the proposal, businesses that rely on imported inputs would lose the ability to deduct their costs in computing their taxable income.\\n\\nThe reform would effectively increase the cost of imported goods by 25 per cent, push up the price of oil produced in the U.S. and of U.S. petroleum products, and depress the price of imported oil, Verleger said in a paper for The Brattle Group, a U.S. consultancy.\\n\\nThe reform would slam Canadian oil producers hard because they export more oil to the U.S. — three million barrels a day — than any other country. Canada imports about 300,000 barrels a day from the U.S. to supply refineries in Central and Eastern Canada.\\n\\nBluntly speaking, for oil the law’s passage is pure mercantilism.\\n\\nSurging U.S. oil production from tight oil discoveries means Canadian oil is not as vital as it used to be to meet U.S. demand. This month, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its 2017 energy outlook that the U.S., a net energy importer since 1953, is on a path to become a net energy exporter in the next decade.\\n\\nThe tax could change oil flows between the two countries completely, Verleger said. U.S. producers would have the incentive to sell at home and no incentive to export.\\n\\nThe proposed changes and their impacts are just now beginning to dawn on the Canadian oil industry.\\n\\n“It’s blindsided everybody,” Verleger said in an interview. “Canadian producers should be worried.”\\n\\nAmong the most impacted could be New Brunswick-based Irving Oil Ltd., which refines oil in Saint John and exports it to the U.S. East Coast, as well as Canadian oilsands companies with refineries in the U.S.\\n\\nThe tax would make Trump’s promised approval of the Keystone XL pipeline to link the Alberta oilsands with U.S. coast refineries less attractive, since the refineries would lose the incentive to buy imported Canadian oil.\\n\\nIndeed, Verleger said KXL would make sense under the new tax regime only if it continues as a pipeline to export Canadian oil from the U.S. Gulf.\\n\\nA senior Canadian oil executive said the prospect of the border tax means a new layer of uncertainty.\\n\\nAlready, Canadian oil and gas companies are struggling to stay competitive with U.S. producers due to new carbon taxes in Alberta, a cap on oilsands emissions and methane reduction regulations that Trump is unlikely to match.\\n\\nRecognizing the major impacts, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal Friday that the border adjustment provision is “too complicated.”\\n\\nMartin King, the director of institutional research at Calgary-based GMP FirstEnergy, said Tuesday the economic implications of such a tax are likely to dissuade Trump, as consumers would ultimately push back against rising consumer prices.\\n\\n“It’s unclear how that’s going to shakeout, and the U.S. is still very dependent on Canadian crude oil imports, it’s still very dependent on natural gas imports from Canada,” King said. “That’s going to have to be clear to them, that it’s just going to make prices higher for everyone in the United States.”\\n\\nThere are other dangers for the U.S. in relying so heavily on domestic production. Tight oil reservoirs are prolific and costs are decreasing, but production history remains short and whether production will continue to grow is a big question mark. U.S. companies have invested heavily in Canada and its energy infrastructure to the U.S. The tax would boost U.S. energy costs and discourage the repatriation of manufacturing. Environmental opposition to fracking is fierce.\\n\\nEven if the border tax goes ahead, the proposal re-enforces that Canada needs to double-down to separate itself from U.S. politics, and its first step is to build Kinder Morgan’s TransMountain expansion so it can export its oil to Asia.\\n\\nFinancial Post\\n\\nccattaneo@nationalpost.com\\n\\ntwitter.com/cattaneooutwest',\n",

When we asked them what they did with this information, they always gave evasive answers, saying it was up to their decision-makers”.\\n\\nThe Free Syrian Army, or FSA, was founded by a group of defected Syrian Armed Forces officers and soldiers in July 2011, and received backing from Britain and the US for its moderate line.\\n\\nLe Monde was shown photographs of a training camp in the northern province of Latakia frequented by foreign Isil fighters. “Naturally I transmitted this to my Western contacts with the GPS coordinates but had not response,” he is cited as saying. “Agents of mine also managed to get hold of phone numbers of Isil officials, serial numbers of satellite equipment and IP addresses. But once again, zero response.”\\n\\nPhoto: AFP\\n\\nIn 2014, FSA fighters under the banner Hazzm Movement were supplied anti-tank missiles in a covert CIA programme and received US military training in Qatar on their use.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2014, while Isil besieged Mossul in Iraq, “M” helped devise a secret plan presented to the Americans to rout Isil from northern Syria on the Azaz-Alep line. The plan was detailed street by street, hour by hour, and included the precise itinerary of fighters and their refuelling points. “In every village held by Daesh, knew the number of armed men, where their offices and hideouts were. We had located snipers and mines, we knew where the local emir slept, the colour of his car and even the brand.

On the radio and as a podcast, the show will seek to build on Rehm\\'s \"legacy of civil dialogue and analysis,\" WAMU writes.\\n\\nAs The Two-Way reported nearly a year ago, when Rehm\\'s retirement was announced, the Peabody Award-winning Diane Rehm Show reaches more than 2.4 million on-air listeners each week:\\n\\n\"Rehm, 79, began her career at WAMU as a volunteer in 1973; six years later, she took over hosting duties of its midday show, which was then called Kaleidoscope. It was renamed for its host in 1984. \"For years, Rehm has hosted her show as she also fought spasmodic dysphonia, which her website describes as \\'a neurological voice disorder that causes strained, difficult speech.\\' Complications and treatments for that disorder have sometimes forced her to take time off from the show.\"\\n\\nEarlier this year, before the host who would succeed her had been chosen, Rehm spoke with the public media podcast The Pub about what sort of show she hoped would follow hers.\\n\\n\"I have held this microphone for 37 years, and it seems to me that it was time to turn it over to someone else, to a younger person with fresh ideas, with a fresh outlook as to what this program might become,\" she said. \"This 10-to-noon real estate in public radio is extraordinarily valuable, and whatever might come next will be fresh and new, and will draw new listeners, perhaps younger listeners.\"\\n\\nJohnson, the incoming host of 1A, spent more than five years as the morning news host for member station KQED in San Francisco and teaches podcasting at the University of California, Berkeley journalism school.\\n\\n\"My professional passions have always centered on creativity, exploration and service,\" he said in a press release announcing the new show. \"This moment in history demands these attributes of us. It\\'s a chance to tell stories more creatively, to explore ideas beyond our own, and to refocus on serving others.\"\\n\\n\"At this moment, our country needs a fresh voice that addresses the wonderful diversity of our nation,\" Rehm said in that release. \"Joshua Johnson represents America\\'s future and is the right host at the right time.\"\\n\\nIf you want to put a voice to the name, you can listen to Joshua Johnson guest hosting The Diane Rehm Show this fall.\\n\\n1A, like The Diane Rehm Show, will be produced at WAMU in Washington, D.C., but the station writes that the show will be \"in touch with communities across the country.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s more from WAMU on the new show:\\n\\n\"The show will take a deep and unflinching look at America, bringing context and insight to stories unfolding across the country and the world. ... \"With a name inspired by the 1st amendment, 1A will explore important issues such as policy, politics, technology, and what connects us across the fissures that divide the country. The program also will delve into lighter subjects such as pop culture, sports, and humor. ... The show will act as a national mirror — taking time to help America look at itself and to ask what it wants to be.\"\\n\\nWAMU also notes that the show is launching \"at a time of deep national reckoning.\" Tracie Powell, founder of All Digitocracy and a senior fellow at the bipartisan Democracy Fund, agrees that the divisive post-election climate poses a unique challenge for the media in general, and especially for a new show such as 1A.\\n\\n\"Right now more than ever, we\\'re delving into some really hard issues and really hard questions,\" Powell says. \"Hearing from people all across the country is really important.\"\\n\\nAnd she says that while there\\'s soul-searching in the media about the need to talk to and about the working class, \"we need to understand that the way we talk about the working class encompasses black, Hispanic and Latino working class as well.\"\\n\\n\"This is a moment in time for more diverse voices to be in public radio,\" she says. \"More diverse voices are present on social media but they need to be amplified. So this is the way to amplify one of those voices — and if Joshua will allow a lot of other voices to be amplified, that\\'s even better.\"\\n\\n\"Those are huge shoes to fill, but it\\'s an exciting opportunity,\" Powell says.',\n",

This is new damage.\\n\\nThe salt content of the ground water is eating away at the bricks that, before excavation, had survived thousands of years.\\n\\nAs we move to the upper town where the elite of the Indus civilization would have lived, and where some of the signature sites like the large public bath lie, it appears even worse.\\n\\nSome walls have collapsed completely, others seem to be close to doing so.\\n\\n\"It is definitely a complicated site to protect, given the problems of salinity, humidity and rainfall,\" says Dr Ibrahim. \"But most of the attempts at conservation by the authorities have been so bad and so amateur they have only accelerated the damage.\"\\n\\nOne method used has been to cover all the brickwork across the vast site with mud slurry, in the hope the mud will absorb the salt and moisture.\\n\\nBut where the mud has dried and crumbled, it has taken with it fragments of ancient brick, and the decay goes on underneath.\\n\\nWe have to do something soon, because if things carry on like this, the site will not last more than 20 years Archaeologist Asma Ibrahim\\n\\nThere are even parts of the site where millennia-old bricks have been replaced with brand new ones.\\n\\n\"In a way, it is testament to Mohenjo Daro that it is still standing, given everything that has been thrown at it in the last few decades in the name of conservation,\" says Dr Ibrahim.\\n\\nEven the Mohenjo Daro museum has been looted, with many of its famous seals (thought to have been used by traders) among the artefacts that were stolen. They have not been recovered.\\n\\nA guide at the site says he too has seen the dramatic changes in its condition and upkeep.\\n\\nAnd while Pakistani visitors do still come on public holidays, he says very few foreign tourists visit Mohenjo Daro now.

       " 'A possible treatment for dementia? Drinking five cups of coffee a day could reverse memory problems seen in Alzheimer\\'s disease, US scientists say. The Florida research, carried out on mice, also suggested caffeine hampered the production of the protein plaques which are the hallmark of the disease. Previous research has also suggested a protective effect from caffeine. But British experts said the Journal of Alzheimer\\'s disease study did not mean that dementia patients should start using caffeine supplements. The results are particularly exciting in that a reversal of pre-existing memory impairment is more difficult to achieve\\n\\nDr Gary Arendash\\n\\nUniversity of South Florida The 55 mice used in the University of South Florida study had been bred to develop symptoms of Alzheimer\\'s disease. First the researchers used behavioural tests to confirm the mice were exhibiting signs of memory impairment when they were aged 18 to 19 months, the equivalent to humans being about 70. Then they gave half the mice caffeine in their drinking water. The rest were given plain water. The mice were given the equivalent of five 8 oz (227 grams) cups of coffee a day - about 500 milligrams of caffeine. The researchers say this is the same as is found in two cups of \"specialty\" coffees such as lattes or cappuccinos from coffee shops, 14 cups of tea, or 20 soft drinks. When the mice were tested again after two months, those who were given the caffeine performed much better on tests measuring their memory and thinking skills and performed as well as mice of the same age without dementia. Those drinking plain water continued to do poorly on the tests. In addition, the brains of the mice given caffeine showed nearly a 50% reduction in levels of the beta amyloid protein, which forms destructive clumps in the brains of dementia patients. Further tests suggested caffeine affects the production of both the enzymes needed to produce beta amyloid. The researchers also suggest that caffeine suppresses inflammatory changes in the brain that lead to an overabundance of the protein. Earlier research by the same team had shown younger mice, who had also been bred to develop Alzheimer\\'s but who were given caffeine in their early adulthood, were protected against the onset of memory problems. \\'Safe drug\\' Dr Gary Arendash, who led the latest study, told the BBC: \"The results are particularly exciting in that a reversal of pre-existing memory impairment is more difficult to achieve. \"They provide evidence that caffeine could be a viable \\'treatment\\' for established Alzheimer\\'s disease and not simply a protective strategy. \"That\\'s important because caffeine is a safe drug for most people, it easily enters the brain, and it appears to directly affect the disease process.\" The team now hope to begin human trials of caffeine to see if the mouse findings are replicated in people. They do not know if a lower amount of caffeine would be as effective, but said most people could safely consume the 500 milligrams per day. However they said people with high blood pressure, and pregnant women, should limit their daily caffeine intake. Rebecca Wood, chief executive of the Alzheimer\\'s Research Trust, said: \"In this study on mice with symptoms of Alzheimer\\'s, researchers found that caffeine boosted their memory. We need to do more research to find out whether this effect will be seen in people. \"It is too early to say whether drinking coffee or taking caffeine supplements will help people with Alzheimer\\'s. Neil Hunt, chief executive of the Alzheimer\\'s Society, said previous research into caffeine had suggested it could delay Alzheimer\\'s disease and even protect against vascular dementia. \"This research in mice suggests that coffee may actually reverse some element of memory impairment. \"However much more research is needed to determine whether drinking coffee has the same impact in people. \"It is too soon to say whether a cup of coffee is anything more than a pleasant pick me up.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBookmark with: Delicious\\n\\nDigg\\n\\nreddit\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nStumbleUpon What are these?

       " \"I came away forced to confront a whole swag-bag full of transphobias that I didn’t know I’d had. So I went to Los Angeles to talk to the filmmakers, and to Chaz himself.\\n\\nJust sitting on a couch with Chaz at his publicist’s office is a consciousness-raising experience. He’s an affable, candid, pudgy, regular guy: very sweet, very comfortable in his skin, jeans, navy blue polo shirt and simple boots. His look might seem deliberately invisible if not for his hair, which he shapes into an excellent controlled pomp that could be described as Office-Casual Elvis.\\n\\nAt this point in his transition, Chaz is in his “second puberty,” a six- to seven-year process of hormone injections. The medical technology for genital reconstruction surgery (masculine genitoplasty, for a transgender man like Chaz) is still too new, expensive, imperfect and risky for him to opt for “bottom surgery.”\\n\\n“I am in a holding pattern,” he said. “The payoff just isn’t quite enough. I wish I had a penis, but I am O.K. for now.”\\n\\nAt age 13, Chaz told me, he knew he was attracted to women, and assumed he was a lesbian.\\n\\n“I knew my whole life something was different,” he said. “As a small kid, I could be one of the boys, playing sports, fitting in. When I hit puberty, I felt like my body was literally betraying me. I got smacked everywhere with femaleness. That was really traumatic.”\\n\\nRealizing that he should be male took years of deduction.\\n\\n“Around 2001, I started analyzing lesbians. I started to realize that even really butch-acting or -dressing women still had a strong female identity that I never had.”\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nThough emboldened by seeing transgender people in the media, he still thought of gender-transition as the last resort of the suicidal: “I thought, transgender people are much worse off than I am. That’s why they’re willing to risk everything to be who they are. But the older I got, the harder it got to stay in my body.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nSeveral scenes in the film are interviews with Cher, who I assumed would act as a guide and interpreter through this signal event in her family. Yet Cher struggles throughout the film and never quite offers a sound bite of unequivocal support for her transgender son. Seeing Cher — gay icon nonpareil — so uncharacteristically jangled raised a sticky batch of questions:\\n\\nCould it be possible that the fact that Chaz is now a man is somehow Cher’s fault? Did the toxic culture of celebrity damage Chastity/Chaz’s gender identity? Did Cher’s almost drag-queenlike hyper-female persona somehow devour Chastity’s emerging femininity? Could Chaz’s transition have been motivated by gender-bent Oedipal revenge? Is he reclaiming the childhood attention his superstar mother always diverted?\\n\\nI had to ask: It is remotely possible that he needed to make the transition because his mom is Cher?\\n\\nHe gave me a warm and genuine smile.\\n\\n“I don’t think the way I grew up had any effect on this issue,” Chaz said. “There’s a gender in your brain and a gender in your body. For 99 percent of people, those things are in alignment. For transgender people, they’re mismatched. That’s all it is. It’s not complicated, it’s not a neurosis. It’s a mix-up. It’s a birth defect, like a cleft palate.”\\n\\nBut being born into celebrity created a different hurdle: Chaz knew he would not be able to change sexes privately. “I thought, the whole world is going to find out! How am I going to be able to live a life after that? I was scared. I believed that people were going to be actively hostile towards me.”\\n\\nAs a “last ditch effort,” he tried to live as a male but without medical intervention. It didn’t work. “I feel very traditionally male,” he said. “I needed a male body.”\\n\\nBeing in-between genders, Chaz said, was far more difficult than becoming a man. He was a misfit. Now, he said, he is treated much better by people, especially men.\\n\\n“I’m constantly shocked by how friendly and cool straight men are to each other. ‘Hey, buddy, how’s it going?’ I expected to feel better and happier, but I really underestimated the impact my transition would have. I didn’t realize that life could be this easy, that I could ever feel this comfortable.

Chaz blushed.\\n\\n“No, really. There is something in testosterone that makes talking and gossiping really grating. I’ve stopped talking as much. I’ve noticed that Jen can talk endlessly.” He shrugged. “I just kind of zone out.”\\n\\n“You just don’t care!”\\n\\n“I just don’t care!” He laughed. “I’ve learned that the differences between men and women are so biological. I think if people realized that, it would be easier. I would be a great relationship counselor. I know the difference that hormones really make.”\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nSex, for him, is completely different now. “I am completely monogamous,” he said, “but I need release much more often than Jen does.”\\n\\nThe weirdest guy thing he does now?\\n\\n“I got way more gadget-oriented, I have to say. I don’t know why. Definitely since transitioning I’ve wanted to be up on the latest, coolest toy.”\\n\\nIN their offices on Hollywood Boulevard, Messrs. Bailey and Barbato, the directors, disabused me of the rest of my Cher-related notions.\\n\\n“That’s a sexy theory, but no,” Mr. Barbato told me. “People don’t change their sex to get back at their parents, any more than people become gay to get back at their parents.”\\n\\nThe two men compared today’s cultural blind spot regarding transgender people to attitudes about homosexuality during World War II, when homosexuals in the armed forces were considered psychiatrically abnormal and were court-martialed and dishonorably discharged. Although many in the psychiatric and transgender communities consider gender identity disorder a medical issue, it is still classified as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association — a stigma that is difficult for any marginalized group to shake.\\n\\n“The notion of trans is incomprehensible to most people,” Mr. Bailey said. “It is so foreign.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nOne of the most interesting aspects of their film is the fact that although Chaz makes the physical transition, the more demanding transition, arguably, is the emotional one that everyone around him must make. There is, in essence, a death and mourning of Chastity, the woman, and an adjustment to Chaz, whom his girlfriend now compares to dating “Chastity’s twin brother.”\\n\\nBut I couldn’t stop asking about Cher.\\n\\n“Cher is very real in this film,” Mr. Barbato said. “She’s not editing herself. She’s processing this majorly traumatic thing for any mother: She’s struggling with the fact that her daughter has turned into a man.”\\n\\nMr. Bailey brings up a fascinating moment in the film: He asks Cher a question, and she just stares, motionless and unblinking as a cobra — an excruciatingly long and pregnant pause. Then her whole posture shifts. She says, “If I woke up tomorrow in the body of a man, I couldn’t get to the surgeon fast enough.” Right then and there it occurs to her how to relate to it.\\n\\nI bring up how uncomfortable we are as a society with people who don’t fit into the usual gender roles, how they can seem unsettling on a visceral level, like a dangling participle or an unresolved chord.\\n\\n“I like things that are incomplete,” Mr. Bailey said. “Life is unresolvedness.”\\n\\nI felt slightly less lame about my own process of understanding when Rosie O’Donnell (a curator of OWN’s social documentary series) told me, in a phone interview, that she, too, had to pave some inner potholes en route to accepting gender transitioning.\\n\\n“As a gay woman, I found it hard to understand,” she said. “I know some very masculine gay women, and I wondered if this wasn’t some kind of repressed homophobia, where being straight makes it more O.K. But all of us struggle with whatever it is: special-needs kids, gay people. We all have our speed bumps.”\\n\\nHistory mostly demonstrates the violence of embracing either pole of moral certainty. The black and white of gender identification has always pushed an infinitude of differences into the margins. Who knows? To finally usher a complete color wheel of sexuality into the mainstream, perhaps it takes a child of Cher.\",\n",

       " 'W ARRINGTON, PA — The last thing you want to hear from a 21-year-old from Mariupol is that, really, there’s not much of a difference between Ukraine and the States.\\n\\nMariupol is one of those featureless Ukrainian rustbelt cities that came of age under the Soviets; its only distinction is that its port is reputedly one of the main conduits through which Central Asian smack makes its way to Western Europe. That Mariupol has the highest per capita number of junkies in Ukraine lends credibility to that rumor.\\n\\nBut worldly Max, having tasted life in cosmopolitan capitals Mariupol and Warrington, Pennsylvania, decided that the two countries were quite alike. My initial, kneejerk reaction was, of course, that Max is totally insane. How could he — a kid with a pinched face who didn’t speak English and whose American experience was limited to a month working at a suburban Burger King — delude himself like that? What was this ignorant punk thinking?\\n\\n“Minimum wage is cool! Nishtyak, blya!”\\n\\nBut after spending a couple of days with Max and a crew of temporary workers in America on J-1 visas, observing their imprisoned life in this far-flung Philly suburb, I concluded that Max’s understanding of America was much deeper than I originally gave him credit for.\\n\\nEveryone’s got strategies for avoiding the most hateful aspects of American life. Since I moved back six months ago I’ve walled myself off from white America, living in a Dominican ghetto and chilling with a group of Nigerian hustlers. Compared to me, Max was a regular Margaret Mead; he’d gone native, studying Americans in their natural habitat. And what he saw from his vantage point washing dishes in the back of Burger King was the true face of modern America — provincial, obese, and entirely joyless.\\n\\n“I came here because I wanted to make a lot of money,” he said. “Don’t get me wrong, I still want it. But now I just think it makes you fat.”\\n\\nThe nearly 20 kids from the CIS that were working in three Warrington area BKs would have made a great cast of characters for the next round of Poslednii Geroi, Channel 1’s Survivor imitation. It was obvious that none of them would ever have hung out together back home, but being without a car in suburban hell is like being stranded on a desert island. Even the few who spoke English with relative ease spent most of their time hanging out with the other CISers. But for the girls’ frequent telephone calls home, they almost exclusively lived in a hermetically sealed Russian-language enclave penetrated only by the American BK workers.\\n\\nThere were two Maxes, the Mariupol cynic and an Asiatic Max from Altai who spent his entire first paycheck, over $300, on an X-Box, TV and the latest Mortal Kombat game. Altai Max had clearly figured out how to make living in the States bearable before the others did. Then there was Vadim, a tall, dorky guy from Minsk with a spindly goatee and the look of a borderline Tolkienist or gamer. Dasha was a cute, bookish girl from Uman who is now studying at the Baptist-financed International Christian Academy in Kiev. There was Viktoria, a total babe from some eastern Ukrainian town who dressed in a sort of cowgirlish style and was screwing a half black guy who worked as a bouncer at a dive the next town over. Yulia didn’t know any English despite the fact that she was enrolled at the English department at Vladikavkaz’s university. Lili was from western Ukraine and didn’t even try to subdue her strong Ukrainian accent. And, of course, Seryozha, the cool kid from Moscow. All they really needed was a representative from Siberia and some hidden cameras, and it could have been a hit series. As it was, without the cameras to prod them into making fools of themselves, it was a pretty boring group.\\n\\nThe modern incarnation of the J-1 visa was created in response to a funny thing that happened about ten years ago, right around the time me and all my contemporaries were supposed to grab the keys to dad’s station wagon, drive to the nearest strip mall and pick up an application at Mickey D’s to land our first jobs. Working a fast food gig seemed, for a while, as essential to the suburban high school identity as the prom, 50 required hours of community service and Turkey Day games against a football team fielded by the neighboring ‘burb. Everybody from jocks to the trenchcoat mafia kids was expected to serve time flipping burgers in order to have disposable income to spend on Oxy wipes and 24 packs of Natty Lite. It was part of what made America great, initiating kids into a life of unfulfilling jobs while ensuring that hordes of office workers would be supplied with cheap, grease soaked calories available at convenient drive-thru windows on the commute home.\\n\\nBut by the time my generation was in Driver’s Ed, minimum wage had long ago stopped keeping pace with inflation. Most of us weren’t willing to work for $4.25 an hour doing anything, let alone that brutal combination of assembly line work, customer service, Big Brother surveillance and unfortunate odors that is working in Fast Food.\\n\\nVarious tactics were tried to keep the machine greased with worker bees — Clinton raised minimum wage slightly, welfare moms were forced to punch clocks in order to get their benefits, multinationals created propaganda to convince employees that they held a stake in the Team — but nothing could keep the lower end of the service industry from hemorrhaging labor. The problem was especially acute in bedroom communities, far from the vast labor pool of black and brown lumpenproletariat of the inner cities.\\n\\nAnd then some clever bureaucrat thought up the J-1 visa. Advertised as a “work-travel” visa that gives foreign students a chance to visit the States, the J-1 functions as a way to import cheap temporary labor without offering any social benefits (J-1ers don’t even have to pay taxes) to places with acute labor shortages, where the workers perform what must be, after fruit picking, the shittiest jobs in the US. Low-wage manufacturing jobs fled the country long ago, but the low-fee service sector had to stay put, for obvious reasons. The J-1 allows places ranging from Burger King to summer camps to tap into the global pool of labor rather than the old-fashioned way of luring workers to miserable jobs, by paying higher wages. It is particularly heinous because the workers have to pay their own way for the privilege of working where no-one else wants to. While it’s sold by places like STAR and Council Travel as an opportunity to see the States, learn English and return home with wads of cash, really it ends up being much closer to indentured servitude.\\n\\nNot all J-1 workers are equal, of course. Everyone from the Irish to Eastern Europeans and Nicaraguans flock here to work for the summer, with the English speakers and veterans generally getting the prime jobs involving free housing, such as working as a nanny or country club bartender. Lots of J-1ers even come back. Nothing prevents motivated J-1ers from hunting for work on their own, so really the guys I met in Warrington were lying in a bed of their own making. It’s probably asking too much to expect a bunch of Russians fresh off the boat to find decent jobs, but the fact is that no-one was forcing them to be in Warrington.\\n\\nThat said, they certainly weren’t getting the exciting working vacation that was advertised. The Russians in Warrington had each thrown down nearly $2000 to finance their trip to the States, which got them a three-month work visa that can be extended for another month in which to travel, a round-trip plane ticket, a social security number and not much else. The sponsor agency (in this case Council Travel, or CIEE) also guaranteed them a 40-hour a week job somewhere in the continental US, housing (which they have to pay for) and directions on how to take a bus there.\\n\\nMost of the Warrington contingent had arrived in the second wave of workers, about halfway through summer, because bureaucratic snafus at the embassies they applied at had delayed their visas. This meant they were shafted before they even got here: in order to make back the money they paid to get the visa, let alone return with some dough, they would have to stay well past the start of the school year back home. So, while the J-1 is billed as a mutually beneficial summer job program, many of these kids would have to either miss a large chunk of the fall semester by working until their visas expired in October or take a loss and returning home in time for the first bell. Everyone in Warrington had borrowed most of the money they used to finance their trips, so pretty much everyone was planning on staying past the start of school to make enough to pay back the debts. It’s really not much of an exaggeration to call them indentured servants.\\n\\nThe original plan was to sacrifice all of their freedoms so that when they did return home, they’d be able to live large for a while. But it works out that they won’t even get to do that.\\n\\nThe kids mentioned above and several others shared three unfurnished two-bedroom apartments in a mini-slum just up the street from a mall anchored by a Target. The development was a collection of maybe 20 identical three-story brick boxes with aluminum faux shutters populated largely by menthol-smoking white trash. Some of the girls had been initially placed in a Latino-heavy apartment building closer to one of the BKs, but that didn’t last too long.\\n\\nWelcome To America! Where there’s always a gray hamburger patty or two in every bountiful fridge!\\n\\nAs if to announce its anonymity, the housing project they were currently living at was called “The Place”; its address, 1600 Street Rd. The parking lot was filled with rusting American cars from the 80’s that were just as boxy as the buildings and must have looked awfully nice to the Russians, who were stuck without wheels.\\n\\nMy “in” to the J-1 CIS crew was Seryozha, the Muscovite, who had contacted me when he arrived in New York on the recommendation of his friend, The eXile‘s designer babe Dasha. He is the quintessential Moscow student, the type of guy who, by his own admission, hangs out at Propaganda “because of the music.” When we first met at a bar near his Upper West Side hostel, he was wearing a tight shirt that exposed his midriff and signifies male prostitute to anybody not from Moscow. He was lucky that he didn’t get off in Harlem like Dasha (not The eXile‘s Dasha, but the J-1 Dasha) mistakenly did on her way home one evening. She got off at 125th St. in a perfectly reasonable neighborhood, but it was awfully jarring for a small town Ukrainian girl who’d never seen black people before, had only heard tales…\\n\\nHundreds of students from the CIS arrived at the same time (Seryozha claimed that some 15,000 Russians had applied for J-1s, a number that doesn’t include the kids from other countries), but there wasn’t any infrastructure prepared to handle their arrival. CIEE, Seryozha’s agency, didn’t even answer the phone when he called them upon arrival. Only by heading down to the office did he manage to find out his job placement, some water park outside of Cincinnati. When he protested, it took them a few more days to generate a new job. But at least he had a free place to stay. Seryozha spent the next few days staying in my apartment, on the condition that he not wear anything exposing his bellybutton within 20 blocks of my place.\\n\\nEvery day he’d come back with stories about Russians who were less fortunate. Some just followed the minimalist directions their agencies gave them to get to their destinations in Florida or Wisconsin or Colorado. Seryozha knows people who spent over 24 hours traveling to prescribed towns, only to find out that, due to a mistake, they were sent to the wrong place and needed to return to New York.\\n\\nAnother group, hoping to hold out for more solid leads to less faraway placements, spent the nights at the Port Authority bus station so as not to waste their scant pocket money on the $20-a-night hostel. One especially savvy chick shacked up with a sugar daddy from the Caucasus that she met in Brighton Beach. “It was total anarchy,” Seryozha said. “The agency already had our money, and just stopped caring.”\\n\\nWhile CIEE did eventually come through with a contract at the Warrington Burger King for Seryozha, not everyone there had one. About half the kids at The Place were working less than 30 hours a week because, while they were told there was work in Warrington, they showed up without signing a contract. The contracts guarantee 40 hours a week; the kids without one were subject to the managers’ whims. Working 30-hour weeks for 7 bucks an hour meant that they’d still be in the red when their visas expired, after adding in the roughly $200 they paid in rent monthly and what little they spent on food and smokes. “These guys operate just like Russians,” Vadim told me. “Here, there… they’re all zhlobi trying to fuck you.” That week, he had only worked 25 hours.\\n\\nSeveral members of the group were conspiring to walk out of their jobs when I visited in early August, but of course they weren’t serious. No employee in the history of fast food has ever been stupid enough to think that he was anything except completely expendable, and these Russians were no exception. It’s not like they had anywhere to go and, besides, there were those pesky loans to repay.\\n\\nClearly they just wanted a chance to vent. “The work is horrible, but what are you going to do?” said Dasha, who never considered walking out. “The thing I really don’t get is what’s with this ‘have it your way.’ What difference does it make whether it comes without the lettuce?” Her point was that the conditions didn’t really matter, because the only reason they were there was to make money. Certainly their lives didn’t look like the brochures they had seen, no doubt filled with smiling kids posing in front of Mount Rushmore and the like. But it’s understandable that some of the kids were kind of shocked by that; most of them come from towns that McDonald’s hasn’t made it to and they probably only realized Big Macs don’t look so juicy in real life after getting trained in at the Whopper station.\\n\\nThe issue they were organizing around was that Yulia had complained to her manager of davlenie, a mysterious non-illness that only Russian women are affected by. The manager didn’t do anything and Yulia ultimately walked home and called a hospital. The hospital, either terrified of litigation or thinking she had a stroke and couldn’t speak properly, actually picked her up in an ambulance and gave her some tests. While she generally agreed with Max that not much was different here, she did concede, “The medical care here really is professional. Back home the doctors keep you waiting and are so rude, but here it’s pleasant to go to the hospital.” Having an ambulance come to her door (for free!) must have really impressed her; I wouldn’t be surprised if she visited a few more times before her visa expires.\\n\\nA couple of them, dismayed by how little they had earned, were entertaining notions of staying as illegals past their visa. Vadim, in particular, wanted to stay until he made as much as he had initially planned. He talked of vague business ideas and how money begets money, but he hadn’t given any thought to the actual mechanics of staying in the US. “What’s he going to do, live in the woods?” Seryozha asked. “He’ll leave like the rest of us.”\\n\\nMany of them seemed homesick. The girls were more open about discussing it, but it was clear that they all missed the motherland, no matter how similar the US seemed to be. Not being able to drink on the streets was a popular subject to harp on, as was the drinking age. Of course, what these conversations were really about was not being able to pick up a 30 cent beer and hang out with people of their own choosing. And, if they were going to go home with anything in their pockets, they couldn’t afford those outrageous American prices.\\n\\nWith the exception of the Asian Max, whose X-Box would be totally useless back in Altai, they only spent money on things they could get here cheaply and take home with them. Basically they’d just written off their time here as a means to accumulate a tiny pool of capital, and I doubt they would have altered their behavior even if they were poised to make thousands rather than hundreds.\\n\\nMost conversations about Americans revolved around banal observations — why there were so many flags or what they did to the grass to make it so lush. Beyond that, they didn’t show much interest in Americans, whom they found to be extremely dull. The one exception, voiced by all the guys, was curiosity about all the black chicks they work with. I’ve noticed that about Russians here — they tend to be drawn to blacks as a kind of antidote to white America’s beigeist culture. Something about them reminds them of back home. Even X-Box Max, who was often hard to disengage from the screen, was curious, “Do they really like to fuck as much as they pretend?” Apparently a few fat black co-workers thought the idea of a Chinese Russian was pretty hot, but he wasn’t quite sure how to handle it as he could barely understand a word the sisters said.\\n\\nIn order to avoid paying for food, the J-1s made every day a BK day. They all seemed to be chunking up from their strict fast food diet — or maybe my memories of Russian girls are too generous — and all of them had acne ranging from medium to moon-pocked. The guys’ eating habits were especially repulsive; they’d smuggle out meat patties and pie slices to stockpile for the days off. When the managers tried to put a stop to the stealing by locking the changing rooms, the Russians developed a system in which they’d hide the food among the dirty uniforms and then retrieve it when they were closing the restaurant. It meant that their meals would often spend hours bundled together with sweaty fetid BK jerseys before making it to their apartment. But, hey, free is free.\\n\\nI’ve eaten many disgusting things while researching stories for the eXile — reindeer guts, cold pirogi with coagulated meat filling, sproti of a Soviet vintage, vobli from the blackened hands of a toothless peasant — but nothing could have made me touch a two day old microwaved ‘fire-grilled’ slab of gray matter that had once been intended for a Whopper. The home fridge was filled with mold-covered meats unfettered even of a scrap saran wrap. When reheated these patties didn’t smell like anything of this earth. Yet that’s what these guys breakfast on every day. As Seryozha told me while preparing a patty, “At least it’s khalyava.” Even vinegar tastes sweet to Russians when it’s free.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, everybody hated life in Warrington. Seryozha tried to hide his shame by claiming it was a nice change from life in the big city, but he wasn’t fooling anyone. They slept on cheap inflatable mattresses that were flat by morning; their only entertainment was courtesy of Max’s X-Box; they subsisted on nuked Whopper patties; and they had paid for the pleasure.\\n\\nThe girls’ apartment was slightly more comfortable thanks to some furniture a sympathetic neighbor contributed, but it still wasn’t pretty. None of them had any illusions that, even there at The Place among America’s most pitiful, they were the lowest caste.\\n\\nIt was particularly poignant because most of these kids were coming from a position of relative privilege; not every Russian can scrape together the 2000 bucks necessary. And they were even denied the gratification of spending what little they made on consumer goods because it was mostly tucked under the inflatable mattresses to be used to repay the relatives who had fronted the money.\\n\\nFew fates, as these hermits will attest, are worse than being stuck in car country without a car. There was a pool at The Place, but otherwise no way to relieve the tedium. The nearby malls were of the dingy bulk-shopping variety and didn’t offer much beyond the initial revelation of how much brand selection Americans have when choosing cheap bath towels, Tupperware and other goods for happy homemakers. Philly, which was only a half hour drive away, supposedly took over two hours to get to on a bus and none of them had ever been there.\\n\\nWarrington was a grim reminder of the uniformity of American suburbs. The only stores and restaurants were prefab chains and walking was so unheard of that on several occasions the cops had actually stopped some of the Russians to find out what they were doing. The town’s main feature, other than the shopping installations that lined Route 611, was a naval airbase. This, with its Soviet style decommissioned-planes-on-pedestals-as-monuments, also might have reminded Max of home. All the J-1ers thought it was weird that, in spite of the proximity of the base, they never saw any soldiers at the BK. They didn’t understand that many of the young, dim-eyed, plump customers were soldiers, since they were so used to the half-starved conscripts in frayed camouflage.\\n\\nEven the “nice” mall offering decent window shopping tended to depress them. “At first it was kind of cool checking it all out,” said Dasha who, a student in Kiev, was one of the most worldly. “But what’s the point if you can’t buy any of it?”\\n\\nThere just wasn’t anything to do. Mortal Kombat provided some respite from the boredom, but not that much. The Asian Max spent the two days I was there on the X-Box; the others wouldn’t play more than a few rounds at a sitting.\\n\\nDeprived of the ability to spend their money, everyone spent hours discussing the few purchases that they had made. Just about everyone had picked up a Discman as a souvenir, since they cost about half as much here, and I watched as they pawed each others’ selections, debated the relative merits, and considered trading them in for other models. No doubt those conversations were repeated innumerable times.\\n\\nMy first night, when I bought a bunch of beer, several of them got pretty drunk, but even then they were remarkably asexual for Russian students. Seryozha has parlayed his cultural capital into screwing a couple of the girls and Viktoria had her exotic boyfriend, but for the most part they were all as prudish as Americans. Maybe it’s the fluoride, or maybe just something inherent in being an American wage slave that kills people’s sex drive.\\n\\nSeryozha’s analysis of the situation was the most lacking. He kept trying to maintain a cosmopolitan Moscow attitude, pretending that he had figured out the essence of New York in his few days there and that he viewed his time in Warrington as something like a trip to the dacha. But it was easy to see through that; the J-1ers are almost always from far-flung provincial towns because those are the places where they’d be willing to subject themselves to just about any humiliation for the prospect of making a couple of Gs. In Moscow, that’s just not that much money.\\n\\nSeryozha found himself surrounded by a bunch of hopelessly primitive CIS hicks; even those admitted they fucked up. His Moscow elitism was transparent, however, because if he really had been part of the elite, what the fuck would he be doing scrubbing dishes at the back of BK? That’s right, he wasn’t even good enough to be presented as the face of Burger King — he had to be hidden in the back. That’s an awfully brutal slapdown: one moment he’s convinced he’s part of the vanguard of European culture, groovin’ to DJ Sanches and discussing Pelevin in a club where he knows half the people, and the next realizing he’s not even good enough to take some fat lady’s order of a super-sized Whopper meal in a miserable suburban grease pit.\\n\\nMuch as he tried to impress the others by showing off his knowledge of Moscow’s various clubs (he laughed at one chick whose knowledge of Moscow’s scene began and ended with Park Avenue), really he was just highlighting how far he’d fallen from when he lived blissfully in ignorance thinking that Moscow counts for anything. His eagerness to show off what he’d seen (“I really just came to get a chance to see the US, but now that I have, I realize that Berlin is much cooler than New York,” he said) made him blind to what was happening. He couldn’t admit to himself that he’d been expelled from the Garden, and pretended he was at the dacha because the truth hurt too much.\\n\\nThe others, living in the long shadows of Moscow, had long known that they were nothing except cheap, expendable immigrant labor and could therefore they could see American provinces for what they were — just another place looking to break you and humiliate you. They had always known they didn’t count for anything and weren’t afraid to admit what was true in Minsk and Vladikavkaz and Mariupol was true in Warrington, too.\\n\\nIt was more than just being broken, though, because they were all broken in a particularly American way. How rare is a Russian who, with a few rubles in his pocket, won’t buy a bottle? Yet these kids were all diligently saving their salaries to pay back abstract loans or spend at some unnamed point in the future. While living in Warrington, they didn’t drink or fuck, they repressed their desires to spend money on a good time, they had long discussions about shit they bought. They hated their jobs but trudged on, smiling when at the register, just like Americans are trained to.\\n\\nThis article was first published in The eXile on September 4, 2003.',\n",
       " 'President Donald Trump is the only president to have a negative net approval rating this early into his administration. | Getty Poll: Trump has highest disapproval rating of any newly elected president\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump has the highest disapproval rating of any newly elected president, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Friday.\\n\\nJust two weeks into his presidency, Trump’s disapproval is at a historic 53 percent — higher than any president before him since polls began tracking it. With an approval rating of 44 percent, Trump is the only president to have a negative net approval rating this early into his administration.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nTrump’s approval numbers, however, are slightly better than they were a week before his inauguration, when he had a 40 percent approval and 52 percent disapproval. But his numbers have worsened since November, when as the newly minted president-elect he had a 46 percent approval and 45 percent disapproval ratings.\\n\\nPresident Ronald Reagan, a former Hollywood actor and California governor who previously held the record low approval rating at this point, tops the incumbent reality TV star-turned-president by 7 percentage points. Reagan had a 51 percent approval rating in January 1981.\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama, Trump’s immediate predecessor, had the highest approval rating. He sat an overwhelming 76 percent in February 2009.\\n\\nDespite his low approval, nearly 8-in-10 respondents said Trump has handled the opening weeks of his presidency as expected. For 42 percent, that’s a good thing. But 35 percent said it’s a bad thing, and for 17 percent who said the early days of the Trump administration have diverged from what they expected, his departure from their expectations is also a bad thing.\\n\\nTrump has opened his administration with an aggressive agenda that has included a number of executive orders and presidential memoranda. But he has harped on his historic election in nearly all of his public comments, proclaimed a war against the media, disputed reports that his inaugural crowd size was smaller than Obama’s in 2009 and told congressional leaders privately — without evidence — that he lost the popular vote because 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton.

And 55 percent, counter to the White House’s characterization, said the travel restriction amounts to a ban on Muslims, which Trump proposed during his presidential campaign.

Like ...\\n\\nWhen you look at the history of video games, most innovations come from stuff that gamers had been clamoring for all along: better graphics, more intuitive controls and the ability to tell fellow players to eat a bag of dicks through a computer screen.\\n\\n7 Metazoa Ludens -- The Game That Lets Your Pet Murder You\\n\\nIf you own a pet but don't have time to play with it because you're too busy, you know, playing GTA and stuff, the Metazoa Ludens project was made for you. It's a system that allows humans and animals to interact in fun, productive ways. For example, by turning your hamster into a giant monster that wants to kill you.\\n\\nVia Wired.com\\n\\nOnly one of those things isn't true in the real world.\\n\\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\\n\\nIn Mice Arena, developed by Mixed Reality Labs, you and your hamster share the same virtual space, only the tables have somewhat turned. As your actual hamster chases a piece of bait in the real world, in the virtual world you are the one being chased by a giant hamster.\\n\\nBy making the character in the game run in terror, the human is actually controlling the crane that carries the piece of food the hamster is chasing. At the same time, the movements of the hamster are replicated by its oversized man-eating version inside the video game thanks to a series of sensors and cameras built into its tank.\\n\\nBut this isn't just for hamsters: Other possible Metazoa Ludens games in development include Jellyfish Trone (a Tron-like game where a real jellyfish is the snake that cuts you off) and Chicken Pacman (in which the chicken is represented by a ghost chasing you through a maze).\\n\\nSo to summarize, it's a way to play with your cuddly pet without actually touching it (you can even play over the Internet), and it trains your pet to successfully chase you down and eat you (since it's learning all of your real-life evasive maneuvers and how to defeat them).\",\n",

I’ve taught college classes in game design since Fall 2006. For any other information, you can Google me.\\n\\nWhat is this blog?\\n\\nThis blog is an experiment in game design and pedagogy. During Summer 2009, I will post a series of lectures, course notes, readings, and challenges to this blog on the subject of game design.\\n\\nThis blog is a course in game design (specifically, non-digital systems design).\\n\\nTuition: none. This class is open to all.\\n\\nPrerequisites: none. It is my intention to make this course accessible to all levels of experience, while providing useful additional resources for those who are advanced.\\n\\nSchedule: Monday 6/29/2009 through Sunday 9/6/2009. Posts will be made twice per week. You can read them at your own pace. The course lasts ten weeks.\\n\\nAudience: anyone with an interest in game design. This includes students who are interested in game design; faculty who teach courses in game design and would like to compare course material; game developers with an interest in design or a desire to see an example of what students are being taught these days; or relatives of game designers who are curious about what these people do all day.\\n\\nTwo levels of participation\\n\\nIf you just want to peek at the content, all you have to do is bookmark this blog and read. You can even post comments.\\n\\nIf you want a more in-depth experience, register for the class by sending an email to gamedesignconcepts@yahoo.com and letting me know that you want in. Registration is free. The purpose for this is not to add you to some kind of spam list, but rather so I can give you access to the other (private) course resources as Summer approaches. In your email, please give your name, city, time zone, and whether you are signing up alone or in a group. Also let me know your level of experience: are you a student, teacher, game designer or other game developer, professional working outside the game industry, etc.\\n\\nWhy are you doing this?\\n\\nI have many motivations for starting this project, some selfish and some altrusitic. Best to be up front about it:\\n\\nGame design is my passion, and I love to share it with anyone and everyone.\\n\\nI have taught some classes in a traditional classroom and others online, and I want to experiment with alternate methods of teaching.\\n\\nBy exposing my course content and viewing the comments and discussions, I can improve the course when I teach it for money.\\n\\nIt is a career move. If this course is successful, it gives me greater exposure in my field and promotes my name as a brand.\\n\\nIs this really, totally, 100% free?\\n\\nThe blog is free, and registration is free. There are some minor costs:\\n\\nThere is a required textbook. It retails for under $25 US.\\n\\nPart of the course will involve the creation of a fully realized non-digital project, so you may need to purchase materials. These usually range from $25 to $50, depending on the game.\\n\\nIt’s still cheaper than college tuition.\\n\\nWhere can I get more information?\\n\\nYou can send an email to gamedesignconcepts@yahoo.com asking for more information.

       " 'Over the years a fair number of the blog posts here have been fairly speculative, basically me thinking out loud about something that has recently crossed my mind or my path. What follows is one of those posts and as I begin writing I have a germ of an idea what I think I want to say but I can’t guarantee that what will come out is what I initial intended or that it will be particularly illuminating or informative. At the end of last week I had the following very brief exchange with zoologist and historian, Matthew the Mancunian Maggot Man (@matthewcobb)\\n\\nMC: What would have happened if Einstein fell under a tram in 1900? What difference would it have made, for how long?\\n\\nMe: Not a lot, Poincaré was almost there and others were working on the various problems. I’d guess at most a ten-year delay\\n\\nMC: So are there any true examples of ‘great men’ or is science all over-determined?\\n\\nMy instantaneous response to Mathew’s last comment was yes there are great men in the history of science and Einstein was certainly one of them but not in the sense that people usually mean when they use the term. It is this response that I will try to unpack and elucidate here.\\n\\nWhen people describe Einstein as a great man of science what they usually mean is that if he hadn’t lived, see Matthew’s original question, we ‘wouldn’t have the theories of relativity’ or ‘physics would have been held back for decades or even longer’. Both of the expression in scare quote are ones that occur regularly following statements along the lines of if X hadn’t existed we wouldn’t have Y and both are expressions that I think should be banned from #histSTM. They should be banned because they are simply not true.\\n\\nLet’s take a brief look at the three papers Einstein published in 1905 that made his initial reputation. The paper on quantum theory, for which he would eventually get his Nobel Prize, was, of course, in response to Planck’s work in this field and was a topic on which many would work in the first half of the twentieth century. The so-called black body problem, which sparked off the whole thing, was regarded as one of the most important unsolved problems in physics at the turn of the century. Brownian motion, the subject of the second paper, was another hot topic with various people producing mathematically formulations of it in the nineteenth century. In fact Marian Smoluchowski produced a solution very similar to Einstein’s independently, which was published in 1906. This just leaves Special Relativity. The problem solved here had been debated ever since it had been known that the Clerk Maxwell equations did not agree with Newtonian physics. We have both Lorentz and FitzGerald producing the alternative to the Newtonian Galilean transformations that lie at the heart of Einstein’s Special Relativity theory. The Michelson-Morley experiment also demanded a solution. Poincaré had almost reached that solution when Einstein pipped him at the post. The four dimensional space-time continuum now considered so central to the whole concept was delivered, not by Einstein, but by his one time teacher Minkowski. Minkowski’s formulation was, of course, also central for the General Theory of Relativity; the solution for the field equations of which were found independently by Einstein and Hilbert, although Hilbert clearly acknowledged Einstein’s priority.\\n\\nWithout going into a lot of detail it should be clear that Einstein is solving problems on which a number of other people are working and making important contributions. He is not pulling new physics out of a hat but solving problems over-determined by the field of physics itself.\\n\\nWhat about other ‘great men’? The two most obvious examples are also physicists, Galileo and Newton. I’ve already done a major demolition job on Galileo several years ago, in which I show that everything he worked on was being worked on parallel by other highly competent scholars that you can read here. And a more recent version here.\\n\\nSo what about Newton?As should be well known Leibnitz and Newton both developed calculus roughly contemporaneously, even more important, as I explained here, they were both building on foundations laid down by other leading seventeenth-century mathematicians. Newton was anticipated in his colour theory of white light by the Bohemian scholar Jan Marek Marci. As I’ve explained here and here Newton was only one of three people who developed a reflecting telescope in the 1660s. Robert Hooke anticipated and probably motivated Newton on the theory of universal gravity and Newton’s work on dynamics built on the work of many others beginning with Tartaglia and Benedetti in the sixteenth century. His first law of motion was from Isaac Beeckman via Descartes and the second from Christiaan Huygens from whose work he also derived the law of gravity. Once again we have a physicist working on problem of his time that were being worked actively on by other competent scholars.\\n\\nI think this brief analysis that the work of these ‘great men’, Einstein, Galileo and Newton, was to a large extent over-determined that is dictated by the scientific evolution of their respective times and their finding solutions to those problems, solutions that others also found contemporaneously, does not qualify them as special, as ‘great men’.\\n\\nHaving said all of that I would be insane to deny that all three of these physicists are, with right, regarded as special, as great men, so what is the solution to this seeming paradox?\\n\\nI think the answer lies not in the fact that they solved the problems that they solved but in the breadth and quality of their work. Each of them did not just solve one major problem but a whole series of them and their solutions were of a quality and depth unequalled by others also offering solutions. This can be illustrated by looking at Hooke and Newton on gravity. Hooke got there first and there are good grounds for believing that his work laid the foundations for Newton’s. However whereas Hooke’s contribution consist of a brief series of well founded speculations, Newton built with his Principia a vast mathematical edifice that went on to dominate physics for two hundred years. Put simply it is not the originality or uniqueness of their work but the quality and depth of it that makes these researchers great men.\\n\\nAdvertisements',\n",
       " 'Black Macken\\n\\nThey had called him every bloody thing but what he was, roaring after him through the woods and thickets that tore at his robes, ankles and face. Sorcerer! Warlock! Witch! As if! In this day and age anywhere in Faerün how could you be so ignorant? Even in this wind blasted little backwater on the shores of the Sea of Stars.\\n\\nMacken was not quick, or particularly fit. He had tried to stay active though, the winters helped around here you had to get wood ready, stack it, grow a lot of your own food, go to market and trade what you grew for what other\\'s grew to provide yourself with some variety of meals. As the town herbalist, posing as the town herbalist anyway, he used his knowledge of Alchemy to create potions that he traded for meat, he ate a lot of meat and he felt like it was to the good.\\n\\nHe felt as if he would make it to the marsh with time to spare when an arrow whizzed by his face. He let out a little yelp of surprise and tried to pick up his pace, the marsh wasn\\'t far. Shouts of men behind him but thankfully no dogs as the marsh came into view through the trees. Against the sky he saw the tower, his very special tower that the townsfolk were afraid to go near but he knew its secrets, he knew its roots went ever so deep into the earth.\\n\\nHe knew the men behind him would figure that they could shoot him down on the marsh Macken made directly for the open swampy ground anyway. He\\'d been very careful; the \"plague\" that had come to the village had not come until more than a year after he had arrived and he\\'d done many good works in that time.\\n\\nThen the slow plague came. Villagers started dying but intervention by Macken saved some, in fact he saved more than he lost and managed to save all of the children. Every time he thanked the gods aloud to the villagers saying it was not he that interceded but the gods, when one succumbed to the plague. The whole point was in fact that villagers die of the plague but he was patient and he was selective.\\n\\nThen the old cleric had come and that had even been at least safe but it had slowed his progress the plague was a real plague you see, a true disease. The occupant of the tower had been a subtle man even back in times even more ignorant than these. He had known a cleric would detect magic masquerading as disease and would know the difference.\\n\\nSo he unleashed the sickness from little beakers through the windows of his victims or onto the vegetables growing in their gardens. They got sick and of course he had the cure. The old cleric had come however and started curing people left and right like it was a bloody game.\\n\\nMacken had still managed to get a couple though but not nearly enough. So the old cleric had to come down with the plague himself. This was more complicated than it seemed and magic was involved. He made sure the man got the disease then when symptoms would be appearing he attacked; sucking the life out of the old man whilst he was asleep. A huge risk but a necessary one, he had gotten a lot of satisfaction watching the light go out of the old man\\'s eyes as he died.\\n\\nMacken broke from the trees and scrub and out into the Marsh. He slowed to a jog and pulled out a scroll speaking its words a multi colored dancing cacophony of fiery lights came into being right in front of the place he\\'d emerged from the thicket.\\n\\nBusiness as usual ended when another Cleric had appeared three months later. Alsonia this one was called, she was much younger, attractive even. One of the advantages of the plague was that it left its victims unscarred and unblemished when it took them. If he had been able to take her with the plague he could have embalmed her and she would have remained attractive for many weeks, he smiled at this though, perhaps there was still hope.\\n\\nAlsonia had suspected him immediately. A plague that didn\\'t spread as other plagues do, that can only be cured by divine intervention or the local apothecary or it killed was suspicious. He kicked himself for not having some people recover without his aid. Her suspicions had culminated in the last few minutes; she\\'d just walked up to his house and detected his alarm spell. The presence of magic was reason enough to investigate his home.\\n\\nShe had found many things in his home, not least of which was the corpse of the last victim of the plague, a corpse that was supposed to be in the graveyard, he\\'d not had time to process it. When the alarm spell triggered he\\'d been at the tower and he had stupidly gone back to his house to investigate. By the time he got there a mob had surrounded his house and he\\'d been spotted right away, now he was in the middle of the marsh seemingly defenseless with a pack of villagers behind him. He stopped running. There was no making it to the tower and that had never been his intent anyway.\\n\\nHe had worked hard and planned for this day. His lank black hair hung down around his pale face and his berry dyed robe was black against the mist he summoned around him as he turned to face his pursuers. They blundered straight into the faery fire and glowed with the nimbus that stuck to them. They caught only a glimpse of Macken as the fog consumed his form. His tactical advantage was complete; he could see them but they could not see him. There was only one more thing for him to do. He produced another scroll and read it.\\n\\nIf he showed his hand whilst Alsonia was still up and about all would be lost. Only she could save the village now. He finished reading from the scroll and the mace wielding figure he could see glowing with fey light out in the mist dropped to her knees then fell face first into the marsh.\\n\\n\"The Cleric!\" One man shouted. \"She\\'s dead!\" The others blundered toward the glowing figure that had run to the cleric\\'s side, in the fog they could see each other with the faerie fire and they huddled together around the priestess. All around them shadows were moving through the mist. Slowly shambling things were coming toward them that had risen soundlessly out of the mire.\\n\\nHe thought back to the writings of the great wizard who had lived in that tower. Malin, of the seven skulls, the Lich of Myth Rynn had left so many treasures in that tower when he left never to return; treasures and secrets that Macken had uncovered would be mere trivialities to the great wizard now but to Macken they were treasures beyond reckoning.\\n\\nHe remembered especially two passages written in the great Wizard\\'s hand:\\n\\nBy far the best place to conceal undead experiments if one does not have total privacy is within water. Animate undead can be instructed to conceal themselves at the bottom of a lake or river holding a stone to counteract any buoyancy. Marshes and Bogs are especially advantageous as the peat moss has preservative properties that can help to prolong the shelf life of one\\'s experiments.\\n\\nMacken presumed this was why the tower was built in this location as his zombies surrounded the unsuspecting townsfolk. Malin uttered a cantrip and his voice rang out through the fog from every direction.\\n\\n\"You are fools!\" he said \"Your cleric is dead and your town will soon follow.\"\\n\\n\"Macken! You bloody warlock! Come and face us man to man!\" Macken visibly stiffened at this statement.\\n\\n\"I\\'m no man and certainly no warlock! I worked for my magic, I studied and shed blood, sweat and tears for it; I\\'m a wizard damn it!\" The speaker, who Maken thought might be Gnost the town hunter and guide, chuckled.\\n\\n\"You\\'re still an abomination Macken, whatever you call yourself!\" Macken thought back to the other passage that sprang to mind as his undead closed in on the mob.\\n\\nThe moment of recognition is sometimes a huge advantage to you if you find yourself in need of disposal of an enemy, using a dead relative as the tool of disposal can often be preferable. A man can be killed more easily by the corpse of his close relative than by the most horrific of creatures with similar physical capabilities.\\n\\n\"Father?!\" Macken heard Gnost say before his blood curdling scream echoed through the fog and his compatriots started to die in similar ways. The zombies formed a ring of flesh so that none escaped. They were beaten, bitten and clawed to death within minutes and only moments later their corpses rose to join the ones Macken had already raised. He walked over to his servants and looked down at his prize.\\n\\nAlsonia\\'s corpse was pristine; he would need the cover of darkness to attack the village he would wait till the hours before dawn to do so when their guard might be down. Until then he would recover his strength and embalm Alsonia\\'s corpse in Malin\\'s lab, no, it was now his lab, his tower, the tower of Black Macken. When he was finished with Alsonia she would remain attractive for many weeks…',\n",

Photo credit: GlobalNews.ca / Screenshot\\n\\nAccording to emails and thousands of other pages of documents released in a freedom of information request by U.S. Right to Know (USRTK), a non-profit advocacy group funded by the Organic Consumers Association, these industry forces conspired to think of ways to discredit Parent and counter her message.\\n\\n\"It\\'s mostly scientists that they attack, but Rachel is a standout,\" Gary Ruskin, the co-director of USRTK, told Global News. \"The agrichemical industry is plainly quite threatened by this teenage schoolgirl, so that’s why they\\'re after her.\"\\n\\nAmong other things, the news outlet reports that University of Florida professor Kevin Folta—whom Ruskin describes as \"one of the principal attack dogs of the agrichemical industry\"—was hired by public relations firm Ketchum to make a video about Parent.\\n\\nAccording to Global News:\\n\\nThe video discussed Parent’s activism, her belief that all GMO food products should be labeled and addressed her apparent lack of scientific knowledge.\\n\\n“So when I think about answering Rachel Parent, who’s the activist child—well, young woman—who’s running the website ‘Kids Right to Know\\' … The things I just adore about Rachel is that she’s clearly very articulate, clearly intelligent,” Folta said in the video.\\n\\n“The problem that I have is when Rachel starts to let non-scientific thinking really kind of cloud her final decision-making process.”\\n\\nParent said she finds the tone of the video “almost degrading.”\\n\\nA poll commissioned by a coalition of consumer and environmental groups showed earlier this month that nearly 90 percent of Americans want mandatory labeling on GMO foods.\\n\\nFor more, see the Global News video below:\\n\\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\\n\\n5 Things Monsanto Doesn’t Want You to Know About the GMO Labeling Debate',\n",
       " 'NOTE: This review is for the second hour of the Dark Matter finale.\\n\\nFor a review of the first hour, check out Dark Matter Episode 12 Review – Meet Your Maker\\n\\nFor our finale broadcast interview, check out The Dark Matter Finale Interview-O-Rama with Two, Four, Five, Six & Joe!\\n\\nPoor Android … She seems to have spent a fair amount of season one in an incapacitated state and that is again how we find her as the last hour of Dark Matter’s first season opens. When Five and Two find her, she’s got a Volkov-Rusi patch in her hand and her neural chip is missing. Without it, Android can’t be brought online again. Since the chip is programmable, whoever has it can pretty much make her do anything they want by reprogramming the chip.\\n\\nAssuming there’s a Volkov-Rusi stowaway on the ship, Two has everyone pair off to do a search. She hands Five a gun and says, “you know how to use it” referring to when the kid shot Cain and saved Two. It marks even more progress for Five in being accepted as an equal. Both she and Android have had to deal with the crew seeing them as somehow less important/useful, but these last couple of hours have seen huge steps in the right direction. This is a family now, but just as every family has a ne’er do well, this family has a traitor.\\n\\nOne and Four are paired off and having a discussion about killing while searching the ship. Four makes it very clear that he’s not trying to start over, but is instead embracing his past with the intention of one day taking the throne in his family’s empire. Judging by this exchange, he’s not planning a peaceful coup.\\n\\n“I don’t know. Enemy or not, the lives I’ve taken weight pretty heavily on me.” – One\\n\\n“I can’t allow them to affect me, because I have so many more to take.” – Four\\n\\nThe topic of Five’s acceptance comes up again when she and Six have a conversation about her using a gun. She feels it makes her useful in a fight, but Six states she’s never needed a gun to be useful. He’s right, but she’s got a point. If she’s truly a part of the crew there will come times when she will need to defend herself with deadly force.\\n\\n“Well, here’s the irony. All this time you’ve been trying to be more like us, we’ve actually been trying to be more like you.” – Six\\n\\nAfter searching the entire ship, Two says they’ve searched everywhere, but Five disagrees. They haven’t searched her little Habitrail network of air ducts, so she again proves her usefulness by patrolling the ventilation. I think she just has the goggles because she loves them so much.\\n\\nFive makes a thorough, but fruitless search of the airways. There’s no one to be found on the ship other than the crew. Because of the way Android was disabled, Two has a hunch to check the vault and there they discover the shock stick missing. Knowing only they have the code to open the Big Damned Door she concludes the person who took down Android must be one of them.\\n\\nSuspicions begin to run high amongst the crew. Not surprisingly, One and Three suspect each other and believe they should be locked up until they get to a space station. Five is convinced it’s Two and she tells Six she’s certain that Two is capable of harming a member of the crew. After hearing that recording, who can blame her?\\n\\nEveryone gathers in the commissary where One and Three begin sniping at each other and everyone looks tense. After drinking some water that Two had poured, Four collapses. At first, I suspected Two had drugged the water, but she looked and acted genuinely surprised, even going so far as to tell everyone not to drink anything that wasn’t in a sealed container.\\n\\nStill fighting like a couple of children, One and Three insist on searching the other’s quarters. To keep the peace they all agree to search everyone’s quarters. Nothing dangerous was found and the only thing remotely suspicious was found in Three’s room. I’m pretty sure this doesn’t pose a threat to the safety of the crew.\\n\\n“A little something I picked up at the last space station … from a little something I picked up at the last space station.” – Three\\n\\nWhen Five asks Six if he would stay in her quarters for safety he asks her why she’s so wary of Two. Five lets him listen to the secret recording she’d made of Two and Four talking about someone having to die. After hearing this, Six has an idea. He gets Five to look over the list of deleted files on her computer and they discover one that was created on the day they went into stasis. Six figured out that Five wrote the program to wipe everyone’s memories, but she did it to try and protect someone, not hurt anyone.\\n\\nThe pair hear a sound in the hallway, so Six goes to investigate telling Five to stay in her room. Naturally, she doesn’t stay in her room, but in this case it was a good thing because she finds Six out cold on the corridor floor.\\n\\nHer screams are heard by One and Three who run down to find that Two is also there. In the med bay they find that Six was injected with the same drug Four ingested in the water. Right at that moment, the ship lurches like something exploded. After getting to the bridge they discover all the engines are down – both FTL and sub-light. Again, they leave Five behind, telling her to lock herself in the bridge, but this time Three gives her a gun. They’ve believe in Five enough now to let her in on a gunfight if needed, and deciding to leave her on the bridge was probably more of a decision based on her tech skills and not on the fact that she’s “just a kid.”\\n\\n“Someone comes through that door that ain’t us … you shoot ‘em.” – Three\\n\\nTwo and Three go in search of the saboteur, but when they split up One sneaks up on Three and holds him at gunpoint, both boys still suspicious of the other. Focused on Three, One doesn’t see Two sneak up behind him and she knocks him out. They lock him in his quarters to eliminate one variable then head down to check on the engine damage.\\n\\nDue to the level of damage and Android being out of commission, HoloDroid comes online and surprises Five. She explains how she was created by Android to observe her unusual behavior and goes on to reveal her analysis discovered a glitch in her personality matrix. Android is technically defective, but Five is adamant that she likes her with her just fine with her flaws.\\n\\n“I need you to do something for me.” – Five\\n\\n“Of course.” – HoloDroid\\n\\n“Shut the hell up.” – Five\\n\\nFive’s not at all happy with HoloDroid advocating a complete reset for Android and since she can’t control the ship, such as opening the door, she’s pretty much useless. Five orders her to erase all files she’s created relating to her diagnostic findings on Android, then delete her own active programming. This is the AI equivalent of ordering her to commit suicide and Five has no problem with it since HoloDroid poses a threat to our Android.\\n\\nTwo gets the engines back online, but when they try to call Five on the bridge they get no answer. Arriving at the bridge, they discover the slippery kid has crawled out through a floor panel. Two checks the controls and discovers some good news and some bad news. Good news: Sub-light engines are back online. Bad news: Long range sensors picked up a Galactic Authority ship headed straight for them.\\n\\nThe only explanation for the GA ship finding them in the middle of deep space is that the traitor sent a subspace communication relaying their position. Their first instinct is to fight, but the controls have been locked with a passcode. Three has had enough and storms off to beat the passcode out of One, whether he has it or not. One was waiting for something like this and soon the two are pointing guns at each other again.\\n\\nTensions and suspicions reach a fever pitch when Two shows up behind One and levels her gun on him. As they’re arguing about who should lay down their weapon, Five rounds the corner with her gun leveled at Two and begins to explain why she suspects their leader of mole-ish behavior.\\n\\nFive says Two is the one who poured the drugged water and was the last one to see the shock stick in the vault. It also explains why the traitor didn’t bring Android back online to control the ship – Two has the skills to do it herself so she wouldn’t need Android. Her case is certainly compelling, but before anything can be agreed upon, they’re taken out by gas grenades which render them all unconscious. All except Two, who was apparently faking, because when the traitor, whose face isn’t shown, walks in she jumps up to fight only to be taken down by that shock stick.\\n\\nGalactic Authority troops storm the ship and remove our crew one by one, in numerical order, no less. As they’re taken past the camera, bound and unconscious, we see the last person in line is very much awake and able to move about freely. It’s our moral compass – Six.\\n\\nWhat could Six’s motivations be for apparently selling out the crew? These are people he’s shown he really cares for, especially Five. That’s the hardest part to comprehend, that he made any deal where Five gets taken into custody.\\n\\nDuring our pre-finale interview earlier in the week, we talked about this shocking scene and were given a hint we couldn’t reveal until after the finale had aired. Now that it has, I can share this information so you can use it to form your own conclusions while we wait for season two to be announced.\\n\\nTake a close look at the uniformed guy to Six’s right. You may recognize him as Lieutenant Anders from episode 8. He was one of the General’s men who could’ve taken out Six’s clone when he attacked the General’s base, but instead let him leave. I can only surmise from that that Anders is one of the “good guys” and that he’s helping Six with some plan that will strike at the Galactic Authority without endangering innocent lives.

       " 'October 10th, 2011\\n\\nRMS – Too Crude to Lose\\n\\nWhen it comes to software freedom, Richard Stallman is a bomb throwing anarchist. That’s a good thing. The FOSS community needs a few bomb throwers in its arsenal.\\n\\nHis job is to keep the bad guys, those who constantly attempt to usurp our principles for their own gain, at bay. More importantly, his job is to expose them, which helps keep us FOSSers from believing the spinmasters when they use Orwellian magic to convince us that “closed is open.”\\n\\nWe are susceptible to such spin.\\n\\nWe love our Linux, we love our GPL, we love our “free and open” so much that we often jump on the bandwagon to proclaim projects “free and open” just because they contain some open source code. Look how pleased many of us are that Android runs atop the Linux kernel. That means it’s got to be FOSS, doesn’t it?\\n\\n\\n\\nNope. Nyet. Nada.\\n\\nWe get confused. We think that OSS is the same as FOSS, which it isn’t. There are lots of open source licenses that don’t guarantee software freedom, and the closed source guys are always more than willing to take advantage of them. Take Apple’s OS X for example. It’s built atop one of the open sourced BSDs. Apple makes most of the source code available for a look see and attempts to win us over by calling that “open source.”\\n\\nBut what can you do with with the OS X source code after you look at it? Can you install it on your vanilla version X86 machine? Can you distribute it freely to all of your friends? Can you modify it and make those modifications available to the public? The answers: nope, nope and nope.\\n\\nThe list of companies pushing non free software on us under the banner of “open source” is long. There are also companies embedding open source software in their devices in ways that are completely contrary to license restrictions. We FOSSers often drink the Flavor Ade and accept non free software as free because we get drunk on the idea that we’re winning, just because there’s OSS in the lineage. As for free code that’s hidden in devices, we’d never even know it was there if not for the suspicious minds of Stallman and his ilk keeping a wary eye out.\\n\\n**********\\n\\nSo Stallman said that he’s glad Steve Jobs is gone. Now everyone is acting surprised, exclaiming “I can’t believe he said that” and calling for his head on a stick. This reaction is just nuts. Of course he said that. What part of RMS do you not understand? He’s a bomb throwing anarchist, remember. Also remember, we need bomb throwing anarchists – and we don’t need them to just throw bombs when it pleases us.\\n\\nWhen he threw the Jobs bomb, FOSS media was covering the death of Apple’s founder as if he was a tech Gandhi. Being caught up in the spirit of the moment, we were drinking the Flavor Ade being served up by the mainstream press. Wasn’t that an inspiring commencement speech he gave at Stanford? Didn’t his products make computing more assessable to the public and didn’t the iPhone revolutionize mobile computing? The answers: yep, yep, and yep.\\n\\nHowever, we were about to forget that those things were only a part of Steve Jobs. We were about to forget that Steve Jobs had a dark side and that he was absolutely no friend to FOSS.\\n\\nThat’s when RMS threw his bomb or slapped us in the face or (insert your metaphor here).\\n\\nSteve Jobs was also a tyrant; you wouldn’t want to work for him. And what about the way that Apple, under his direction, was going about filing lawsuits seeking to stop Android at every turn? Or how about the fact that much, if not most, of Apple’s software is built on open source code that has been turned proprietary and closed – with very little being returned to the open source community?\\n\\nYes indeed, Mr. Stallman is very crude. His farts probably stink and his piss probably smells like urine. I doubt whether RMS cares whether we like him or not. He just wants to stop the bad guys. He just sees himself as a software freedom fighter – which I guess he is. If we win the war for software freedom, a consequence might be we’ll find we’ve won other freedoms as well.\\n\\nI’m sorry that Mr. Stallman can be a jerk – but I’m glad he’s on our side.\\n\\nRelated',\n",

       " 'by Judith Curry\\n\\nA new study finds that human-caused warming in the west tropical Pacific was not responsible for a series of frigid North American winters experienced over the early 2000s.\\n\\nA number of papers have been published in recent years arguing that global warming — via declining Arctic sea ice — is causing increased snowfall and colder winters in the Northern Hemisphere.\\n\\nA 2014 paper published in Science by Tim Palmer entitled Record breaking winters and global climate change argued that rising greenhouse gas emissions may have played a role in the severe 2013-2014 winter in the U.S. midwest via a mechanism whereby global warming has caused changes in the location of the jet stream tied to warming of the surface waters in the tropical west Pacific.\\n\\nA new paper by Sigmond and Fyfe contradicts Tim Palmer’s notion the notion that tropical Pacific changes have increased the probability of the unusually cold winters observed in recent years.\\n\\nTropical Pacific impacts on cooling North American winters\\n\\nMichael Sigmond & John C. Fyfe\\n\\nAbstract. The North American continent generally experienced a cooling trend in winter over the early 2000s. This cooling trend represented a significant deviation from expected anthropogenic warming and so requires explanation. Previous studies indicate that climate variations in the tropical Pacific contributed to many mid-latitude climate variations over the early 21st Century. Here we show using large ensembles of fully-coupled, partially-coupled and uncoupled model simulations that in northwest North America the winter cooling was primarily a remote response to climate fluctuations in the tropical Pacific. By contrast, in central North America the winter cooling appears to have resulted from a relatively rare fluctuation in mid-latitude circulation that was unrelated to the tropical Pacific. Our results highlight how decadal climate signals – both remote and local in origin – can together offset anthropogenic warming to produce continental scale cooling.\\n\\nPublished in Nature Climate Change [link]. The paper can be read on readcube [link]\\n\\nThe methods used in the paper combine global observations, and a series of climate model experiments that include fully coupled, partially coupled (constrained by observations) and uncoupled (atmosphere only) simulations. Excerpts:\\n\\nHaving established that the models used in our study reproduce the observed linkages between the tropical Pacific and North America, we now investigate their simulated trends in the early 21st Century. First we employ the ensemble of fully-coupled CanESM2 simulations to explore potential links between variations in the simulated ΔSAT (surface air temperature) trend and variations in the simulated SAT trend averaged over NWNA (northwest North America). [There is] a positive trend in ΔSAT (corresponding to a weakening zonal temperature gradient) and a relatively small cooling trend over NWNA. This indicates that had the simulated tropical Pacific variability in the model been aligned in time with that observed that it would have likely simulated the observed cooling over NWNA. This is our first line of evidence that the observed winter cooling over NWNA from 2001-2002 to 2013-2014 was a remote response to decadal changes in the tropical Pacific. Our second line of evidence is obtained from an ensemble of partially-coupled CanESM2 simulations where surface wind stress in the tropics is constrained to follow its observed monthly evolution from January 1979. In all of these so-called “pacemaker” experiments the observed trade wind intensification and associated ΔSAT increase is associated with cooling surface temperatures over NWNA. These results are consistent with relationships that exist between winter-to-winter fluctuations and 14-year trends in ΔSAT and NWNA SAT.\\n\\nIndeed, it appears that the Aleutian Low weakening observed over the early 21st Century, arguably the most pronounced feature in recent Northern Hemisphere SLP (sea level pressure) trends, can be attributed to tropical Pacific climate variations. Moreover, the associated cold air temperature advection was sufficient to overcome the externally-forced warming to cause cooling over NWNA. By contrast, tropical Pacific related SLP trends over the east coast of North America drove southwesterly winds to produce warming, rather than cooling, over CNA (central North America). Hence, tropical Pacific variability cannot explain the observed winter cooling over CNA.\\n\\nIt is clear that tropical Pacific SAT trends played an important role in early 21st Century mid-latitude climate trends, particularly over NWNA. We ask if this is due to cooling in the central to east Pacific, or due to warming in the west tropical Pacific? To address this question we employ uncoupled simulations using CanESM2. We perform control runs with prescribed SST and sea-ice averaged over the period between 1997 and 2007, and simulations that use the control SST and sea-ice except over the key regions.\\n\\nIn response to warming in only the west tropical Pacific a slight warming of CNA is found, contradicting the notion that west tropical Pacific warming was responsible for the observed CNA winter cooling. Our analysis indicates that tropical Pacific changes during the early 21st Century produced a warming impact over CNA.\\n\\nUsing our uncoupled simulations, we investigate the speculation [of Palmer] that the probability of these unusually cold winters may have increased due to the tropical Pacific changes. To arrive at statistically robust conclusions, we extended the uncoupled control simulation and the simulation with SST changes in the tropical Pacific region, where the SST and sea-ice fields were taken from observations. We find that it is less likely to find a colder winter in the perturbed simulation than in the control simulation. Hence, our results contradict the notion that tropical Pacific changes have increased the probability of the unusually cold winters observed in recent years.\\n\\nIf the recent CNA winter cooling cannot be attributed to tropical variability, then what was its cause? To address this question we return to the large ensemble of coupled CanESM2 simulations and note that in three of 100 ensemble members a stronger than observed CNA winter cooling was simulated. Figure 6 shows the average simulated climate trends over the five ensemble members with the largest CNA winter cooling. As in observations this cooling is the result of northerly winds associated with a ridge of increased SLP over the west coast of North America and CNA. The composite shows that outside the mid-latitudes there are no climate trends that are substantially different from the forced response. This indicates that the observed CNA winter cooling over the early 21st Century was not a response to decadal changes in the tropical Pacific, but was instead the result of a local internally-generated fluctuation in circulation that was unrelated to the tropical Pacific.\\n\\nOur analysis shows how remotely and locally generated decadal climate variations have offset anthropogenic warming to produce North American winter cooling over the early 21st Century. Similar to the slowdown in the rise of global-mean surface temperature this cooling is very likely to be a temporary feature, as future decadal variations could be opposite in sign and amplify anthropogenic warming of North American winters.\\n\\nJC reflections\\n\\nI featured this paper for several reasons. The first reason is that I really like the way the climate model experiments were designed, particularly in the use of simulations that are constrained by observations in key regions. This methodology is similar to that used by Kosaka and Xie discussed in a previous post Pause tied to equatorial Pacific surface cooling.\\n\\nThe second reason is that the U.S. winter temperatures drive energy demand, determining the price of natural gas (and profits for energy traders and regional power providers) and also the amount of carbon emitted in keeping the nation warm. My company’s energy sector clients are already asking about next winter’s temperatures, and whether we can expect a typical La Nina pattern. Depending on the situation, we can start to get a read on next winter’s ENSO sometime during the period May-July. For this year, all the signs are for ENSO to be in negative territory for next winter — whether this means La Nina or neutral (with negative shades) can’t be decisively determined at this point.\\n\\nGlobal seasonal climate forecast models are getting more sophisticated, with an improving track record, but their skill is not very high at making a forecast 6 months out (for winter, initialized in early summer). Hence statistical seasonal forecasts of ENSO and long range weather forecast patterns are also made by forecast providers. Untangling the relevant signals from past observations often provides tantalizing relationships that seem to work for a few seasons, then stop working. Which of course implies that the complete climate dynamics in play weren’t adequately accounted for.\\n\\nThe key challenge is to integrate our understandings of the mechanisms and transitions of the modes of multi-decadal, interannual and seasonal climate variability so that we can develop better seasonal climate forecasts. Studies such as this new paper by Sigmond and Fyfe are providing key insights into the predictable versus unpredictable parts of seasonal climate variability.',\n",
       " 'Paris, France (CNN) French authorities took the offensive Wednesday, raiding a purported hideout of the suspected ringleader in last week\\'s deadly Paris attacks in an operation that ended with eight detained, two dead and potentially more bloodshed thwarted.\\n\\nBut what about that suspected ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud\\n\\nAt one point, authorities believe he was holed up on the third floor of an apartment building in the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Wednesday. Whether he was there when scores of heavily armed French police launched their assault at 4:20 a.m. Wednesday (10:20 p.m. ET Tuesday) is unknown.\\n\\nSome residents in the area told CNN they saw Abaaoud recently in the neighborhood and at a local mosque.\\n\\nInvestigators zeroed in on the building after picking up phone conversations indicating that a relative of Abaaoud might be there. They met fierce resistance from the start, including an armored door, a woman who blew herself up and bullets flying back and forth for about an hour. The French officers even used powerful munitions, which led to one floor of the building collapsing.\\n\\nThat violence produced rubble that included body parts, on which investigators are conducting DNA tests.\\n\\nNeither Abaaoud nor suspect Salah Abdeslam , for whom authorities have been hunting since the attacks, were among those detained in the operation, Molins said.\\n\\nFrench President Francois Hollande held up the vicious back-and-forth as further proof that \"we are at war\" with ISIS.\\n\\n\"What the terrorists were targeting was what France represents. This is what was attacked on the night of November 13,\" he said. \"These barbarians targeted France\\'s diversity. It was the youth of France who were targeted simply because they represent life.\"\\n\\nISIS first drew international attention for taking over swaths of Iraq and Syria, leaving a trail of violence and destruction in its wake. And its efforts to bring terror to the global stage seem to be growing. This month alone, ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, the downing of a Russian passenger jet in Egypt and a pair of suicide bombings in Beirut.\\n\\nFrance had already been part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS with airstrikes. But the country has stepped up its efforts since the series of shootings and explosions in Paris last week, which killed 129 people.\\n\\nNow, Hollande has proposed extending France\\'s state of emergency for three more months -- a measure that, among other things, gives authorities greater powers in conducting searches, holding people and dissolving certain groups.

By reducing blue light exposure, Kobo Aura ONE’s enhanced front-light technology lets people enjoy nighttime reading without impacting their sleep. An ambient light sensor automatically detects current light levels to emit the optimal brightness based on the time of day; by setting a bedtime hour, the hue of the light mimics the sun’s natural progression. Readers can also manually choose their own light settings based on personal preference.\\n\\n\"Getting the right amount of sleep is extremely important, and is just as valuable to your health as a balanced diet and daily exercise routine,” says Colleen Carney, Associate Professor and Director of the Sleep and Depression Laboratory at Ryerson University. \"A lot of people find it hard to wind-down at the end of the day, and falling asleep with a racing mind doesn’t make it easy. Doing something relaxing like meditation, yoga or reading for 20 minutes before hitting the pillow can help, but we’ve all heard that reading on an electronic device can hinder a restful night’s sleep due to the activating effects of blue spectrum light. We require red spectrum light to stimulate melatonin, a hormone that regulates our body clock. This device pays attention to the timing of blue and red spectrum light to protect sleep quality.\"\\n\\nShe said a lot of people troubled by insomnia or sleeplessness give up their reading devices. \"That’s the last thing I want you to do,\" says Carney. \"Depending on what kind of bedside light you have, I’d prefer you to read on a device, and one that eliminates blue light is excellent. It’s especially important for teens who are much more photo sensitive than adults.\"\\n\\nBorrowing eBooks has Never Been Easier: Readers can easily connect to their local public libraries right from their Kobo Aura ONE with built-in, one-touch OverDrive library lending access*.

       " 'In celebration of its 100th birthday, the bad old days have returned to Grand Central Terminal.\\n\\nDroves of homeless people are flooding the landmark again — even as workers prepared for last week’s centennial celebration.\\n\\nOn a windy Wednesday, The Post spotted at least 40 hobos in search of free eats and a warm place to flop.\\n\\n“It’s nauseating,” said Yvette Molina, a Tarrytown resident, who was lunching in the concourse. “It’s really disgusting. It makes you lose your appetite.”\\n\\nIn scenes reminiscent of the 1980s, one man picked through the garbage, rewarding himself with a half-eaten slice of pizza and a bag of nuts. A woman snored loudly as she slept, sitting upright on a concourse bench. And another man hoisted an oil can of Foster’s lager with filth-encrusted fingers.\\n\\nThe sights and smells — the stench of body odor easily overwhelmed the appetizing aromas from Magnolia Bakery — are enough to rattle the senses of even the most seasoned travelers and workers.\\n\\n“Every day you see new homeless. Sometimes they smell — a bad smell,” said Hafiza Supti, who works at a Hudson News stand. “I have to move from one place to the other place.”\\n\\nPolice periodically roust the vagrants, but unless they’re closing the station for the night at around 2 a.m. or someone is breaking the law, cops won’t forcibly remove them.\\n\\n“Our hands are tied,” said one MTA cop. “We can’t really make them do anything. We can’t just throw them in the cold.”\\n\\nOne of Grand Central’s denizens, James Patrick McGrath, 59, says cops are not always agreeable.\\n\\n“I’ve got an officer who accuses me of begging,” the Flatbush native said through a matted beard. “He calls me a skell. I call him a schmuck.”\\n\\nMcGrath, who stared through rheumy blue eyes and was dressed in two ratty winter coats, said a few years ago, the homeless would seek shelter along the Metro-North tracks, but not anymore. Now, at night, they simply ride the rails if they are chased out.\\n\\n“During the day, most people sleep at the tables,” McGrath said. “Forget about laying down — they’ll harass you.”\\n\\nFor decades since its opening on Feb. 2, 1913, the homeless used Grand Central as a place to crash till morning. But by the late 1980s, as the crack epidemic raged, the situation reached epic proportions, with 500 homeless staying there at any given time and at least 50 people living there year-round, according to the recent book “Grand Central: How a Train Station Transformed America.”\\n\\nNow, the homeless increasingly take refuge there, and soft-hearted commuters can be part of the problem by offering handouts, say cops.\\n\\n“People feel sorry for them,” he said. “We try to offer them services. Sometimes, they accept. Sometimes, they don’t. Most of them don’t want to be bothered.”\\n\\nHarold Nelson, 58, counts himself among the latter category. He said he quit work as a hot-dog vendor because “there was no money in it.” He doesn’t want to live in a homeless shelter because of the rules.\\n\\nInstead, he cycles through Grand Central, Penn Station and the Port Authority, seeking warmth during the colder months and spare change year-round.\\n\\nNelson says cops shuffle the homeless around during the day, but force them to leave between the closing hours of 2 and 5 a.m.\\n\\n“The cops should be more considerate of people eating,” Molina said.',\n",
       " 'This spacewalk is one of the most significant one ever done because it revealed how much it is difficult to work outside a spacecraft. Up to that day, engineers and ground controllers thought that spacewalking astronauts could do about anything, but Eugene Cernan\\'s EVA revealed the opposite: the simplest task needs to be carefully planned in advance. Cernan nearly lost his life \\x97 more than once \\x97 during his spacewalk! After the troublesome Gemini 8 mission, during which David Scott was to have performed an EVA, Gene Cernan became the second U.S. spacewalker on this Gemini 9 mission. He is the first to have made an entire orbit around the world out of a spaceship, to have sense both day and night in space. In his biography, Cernan told: \\x93When I pumped my suit up to three and one half pounds of pressure per square inch, the suit took on a life of its own and became so stiff that it didn\\'t want to bend at all. Not at the elbow, the knee, the waist, or anywhere else. It was as if I wore a garment made of hardened plaster of Paris, from fingertip to toe. \\x93When the hatch stood open, I barely pushed against the floor of the spacecraft and my suit unfolded from the seated position. I grabbed the edges of the hatch and climbed out of my hole until I stood on my seat. \\x93And, oh, my God, what a sight. Nothing had prepared me for the immense sensual overload. I had poked my head inside a kaleidoscope, where shapes and colors shifted a thousand times a second. I did not have the words to match the scene. No one does. \\x93While Tom [Gemini 9 Commander Tom Stafford ] held my foot to anchor me, I positioned a sixteen-millimeter Mauer movie camera on its mount and retrieved a nuclear emulsion package that recorded radiation data and measured the impact of space dust. Then I stretched forward and planted a small mirror on the nose of the spacecraft. Using it, Tom could watch when I started my trek back to the AMU [Astronaut Maneuvering Unit \\x93space scooter\\x94]. \\x93My only connection with the real world was through the umbilical cord, which we called the \"snake,\" and it set out to teach me a lesson in Newton\\'s laws of motion. My slightest move would affect my entire body, ripple through the umbilical, and jostle the spacecraft. We were forced into an unwanted game of crack-the-whip, with Tom inside the Gemini and me on the other end of the snake. \\x93Since I had nothing to stabilize my movements, I went out of control, tumbling every which way, and when I reached the end of the umbilical, I rebounded like a Bungee jumper, and the snake reeled me in as it tried to resume its original shape. I hadn\\'t even done anything yet and was already losing the battle. There had been no advance warning on the difficulties I was having because everything I did was new. I was already beyond the experiences of White and Leonov, moving into uncharted territory. Nobody in history had ever done this before. \\x93I felt as if I was wrestling an octopus. I was looping crazily around the spacecraft, ass over teakettle, as if slipping in puddles of space oil, with no control over the direction, position or movement of my body, and all the while the umbilical was trying to lasso me. Without a stabilizing device, I had no control over the umbilical, and it pretty much did whatever it wanted. \"I can\\'t get to where I want to go,\" I told Tom in exasperation. \"The snake is all over me.\" \\x93I fought it for about thirty minutes before deciding that this snake was perhaps the most malicious serpent since the one Eve met in the Garden of Eden. \\x93I took a short break before moving to the rear of the spacecraft, where the backpack was stowed, and again was faced with the enormity of what lay before my eyes, a feast for the senses. \\x93I needed to reach the rear of the spacecraft while I still had sunlight, then check out the backpack and strap it on during darkness. Then I would exchange the umbilical connected to my chest pack for the power and oxygen contained within the AMU, and tether myself to the spacecraft with a 125-foot-long [38 metres] piece of thin nylon line. So the next time the Sun popped up, Tom would flip a switch, the single bolt holding the backpack to the Gemini would shear, and I\\'d be off, rocketing around on my own, the first human to be an independent satellite. Master of the Universe. But first, I had to get to where the backpack was folded up like some bizarre bird in a nest. My space suit fought my every move, and I needed both flexibility and mobility, the two things it did not have. It was blown up like a balloon figure in the Macy\\'s Thanksgiving parade, and tried to hold that shape, no matter how I sought to bend it. Push in on a party balloon and it will resume its original shape when your finger pressure is removed. Same thing in outer space. My heartbeat increased with the effort, and I was breathing hard, trying to find leverage. \\x93I worked my way hand-over-hand along a small railing, we entered darkness over South Africa. I unfolded the restraining bars alongside the backpack, and clicked on a pair of tiny lights for illumination. Only one lit up, providing less help than a candle. Lord I was tired. My heart was motoring at about 155 beats per minute, I was sweating like a pig, and I had yet to begin my real work. \\x93I could barely see anything at all as I worked through the thirty-five different functions required to make the thing ready to fly. What seemed simple during our Earth simulations was nearly impossible in true zero gravity. Sweat beaded on me and stung my eyes. The helmet prevented me from wiping them. Eventually I flipped the final switch and the backpack powered up. Almost time to fly. \\x93I was having a hard time seeing things, but it took a while to realize that it wasn\\'t just because of the darkness. I was working so hard that the artificial environment created by the space suit simply could not absorb all of the carbon dioxide and humidity I was pumping out. Vision through my helmet was as mottled as the inside of a windshield on a winter morning, and I told Tom, \"This visor is sure fogging up.\" \\x93The work was more than hard, and I was panting for breath as my heartbeat soared to 180 beats per minute. Since the visor was fogged on the inside, and I obviously couldn\\'t remove the helmet to wipe it dry, my only choice was to rub my nose against the inside of the shield to make a hole through which I could see. \\x93Although my mask was cold, my lower back was scalding hot. During the somersaults of daylight umbilical dynamics, I had ripped apart the rear seams on those seven inner layers of heavy insulation and the Sun had baked the exposed triangle of unprotected skin. Now I had a major sunburn and nothing could be done about it until I took off the suit, which would be at least another day. I had a lot bigger things to worry about at the moment, so I disregarded the fiery sensation.\\x94 [ ]\\n\\nGemini 9 Commander Thomas Stafford (left) and Pilot Eugene Cernan.

       " 'Preview | Recap | Notebook\\n\\nHeat-Rockets Preview\\n\\nBy NOEY KUPCHAN\\n\\nPosted Mar 04 2014 1:21AM At this point, LeBron James may never take his mask off. Coming off the highest scoring performance of his career, James tries to lead the visiting Miami Heat to a ninth straight win and eighth in a row over the Houston Rockets as two of the NBA\\'s hottest teams square off Tuesday night. James put on a show in Monday\\'s 124-107 win over Charlotte, posting a franchise-record 61 points while making 22 of 33 shots. \"The amazing part is the efficiency,\" teammate Shane Battier said. \"Good Lord. Sixty-one on 33 shots, that\\'s Wilt Chamberlain-esque. That\\'s pretty amazing. Incredible performance.\" The four-time MVP also set team records with most points in any quarter (25 in the third) and most in the second half (37). He finished 8 of 10 from 3-point range after making his first eight attempts. \"The man above has given me some unbelievable abilities to play the game of basketball. I just try to take advantage of it every night. I got the trust of my teammates and my coaching staff to go in there and let it go,\" he said. \"Every night I go on the floor I want to be the MVP, of this league, MVP of this team, MVP for me, myself and my family. I\\'ve set a high standard and I have to live by that.\" James, who has been wearing a protective mask to shield a broken nose, has averaged 37.1 points on 63.7 percent shooting while playing in seven of Miami\\'s eight consecutive wins. The Heat (43-14) have outscored opponents by an average of 13.9 points during their run. \"If he\\'s going to shoot the ball like that from that range, there\\'s nobody that\\'s going to beat them,\" Bobcats coach Steve Clifford said. The Rockets haven\\'t been able to slow down Miami, which is averaging 112.6 points over a seven-game winning streak in the series. James is averaging 33.8 in the last four meetings, and Dwyane Wade is at 31.3 in his last four. The Rockets (40-19) have won 11 of 13 after beating Detroit 118-110 on Saturday. Terrence Jones led the way with 22 points and 10 rebounds, and James Harden scored 20 to go with 12 assists. The Rockets improved to 25-3 when Jones scores more than 10. Houston took a 23-point lead into the break before letting up a bit in the second half. \"I thought we should have really put the foot on the gas,\" All-Star center Dwight Howard said. \"We didn\\'t. We allowed them to get back into the game, and that is not what we need to do if we want to be a championship team.\" The Rockets are 17-3 against Eastern Conference opponents, including 12-0 at home. The Heat are 17-4 versus the West, and 8-2 in the second half of back-to-back games. \"Great team, it\\'s going to be a good challenge for us,\" said Harden, whose team is on the verge of a season best-tying sixth straight home win. \"Limit our turnovers and rebound the basketball - if we do those two things, we\\'ll be in good hands.\" Harden had 36 points, a career-high 12 boards and seven assists in a 114-108 loss at Miami last Feb. 6. James and Wade scored a combined 63 in that game. Wade sat out Monday to rest his knees, but he figures to play in this one. He is averaging 23.5 points while shooting 62.1 percent in his last four games. Houston\\'s Chandler Parsons could also return after sitting out Saturday due to a sinus infection. The Heat\\'s Erik Spoelstra was named East coach of the month for February, and Houston\\'s Kevin McHale won in the West.\\n\\nCopyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

Dwight Howard had 22 points and 16 rebounds, James Harden added 21 points and the Houston Rockets held James in check Tuesday night during a 106-103 win over the Miami Heat. James had a chance to tie the game with a desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer, but it was off - just like most of his second-half shots. The four-time MVP finished with 22 points, one night after setting a club record with a career-high 61 against Charlotte. He acknowledged before Tuesday\\'s game that he was \"extremely tired\" and that he spent most of the day sleeping. James had 19 points by halftime, but appeared to drag at times in the second half and spent the first half of the fourth quarter on the bench. He was 1 for 7 after the break. \"I fought through it in the first half. Second half it just wasn\\'t there for me,\" James said. \"Got out of rhythm.\" Still, the Heat cut their deficit to three when Michael Beasley hit a 3-pointer with 21.2 seconds left. Harden threw the ball away after that, and Howard accidentally hit James in the face when they both went up to try to grab a long pass. James lay on the court holding his broken nose for a few seconds before getting up and slowly walking to the bench. He has been wearing a protective mask to protect his nose. James remained in the game after a timeout, then missed the desperation 3 with Howard in his face. \"I knew I had to put up a heave over top of him,\" James said. \"I felt like I got a good look - just a little long.\" The Rockets used the word composed repeatedly after the game to describe their play. \"There\\'s no need for us to get worried,\" Howard said of the team\\'s mindset after Beasley\\'s 3. \"Situations like that, the best thing we can do is stay composed. If we point our finger or put our heads down, it gives the other team confidence. That\\'s something we\\'ve been trying to work on all year.\" Dwyane Wade had 24 points for the Heat after sitting out Monday night. Beasley also scored 24, a season high. Miami never led, but tied it twice in the fourth quarter. Houston used an 11-2 spurt to take a 104-95 lead with less than 3 minutes remaining. \"We were able to push back in the fourth quarter and tie the game up,\" Wade said. \"But we had to exhaust so much energy trying to come back.\" Houston led by 13 early in the fourth before two separate runs by the Heat tied it at 91 with 7 minutes remaining. The also tied it at 93 before Houston used its late run to close it out. \"We did some good stuff,\" Rockets coach Kevin McHale said. \"We made some plays. ... I thought during stretches in this game we played really well.\" The Heat had made consecutive 3-pointers to cut the lead to seven early in the fourth quarter when Chris Andersen blocked a shot by Donatas Motiejunas. Andersen stood under the basket after the block and taunted Motiejunas, drawing a technical foul. Miami then used an 8-0 run, which included a 3 by Beasley, to cut it to 88-87 with 8 1/2 minutes left. Houston opened the second half with a 9-2 run capped by Chandler Parsons\\' dunk over James. Shane Battier had a basket for Miami after that, but Houston reeled off six straight points to extend the lead to 68-56. An airball on a 3-point attempt by Wade was one of three missed shots by the Heat in that span. The Rockets were up by nine soon after that when Harden launched a long alley-oop to Howard, who barely grabbed it in time to sail over Chris Bosh for the dunk. Howard picked up a foul with about 5 minutes left in the first half when he ran into James as he was driving to the basket, causing him to lose control of the ball, which bounced off James\\' mask. A reverse layup by James and a free throw by Wade in the last 20 seconds of the first half cut Houston\\'s lead to 53-52 at halftime. The Rockets jumped out to a 7-0 lead and were up 39-32 at the end of the first quarter. NOTES: Hall of Fame center Hakeem Olajuwon, and Houston Texans stars Andre Johnson and Arian Foster attended the game, as did Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson and former Astros pitcher and seven-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens. ... James said the best compliments he received following his big game against Charlotte came from the two most important women in his life. \"My mom and my wife saying how proud they were of me and that I never cease to amaze them,\" he said. \"So it\\'s always great when your family gives you that type of gratitude and response.\"\\n\\nCopyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

       " 'Belonging. Identity. Who do you think you are? Who do they say you are? For thousands of indigenous Canadians, it\\'s complicated. Records have been obscured or obliterated through hundreds of years of assimilation. The federal government — from bureaucrats to Indian agents — made these decisions based on the political mandates of the day. First Nations have made their decisions. So have individuals. In this occasional series, The Status Card, Tanya Talaga, the Star\\'s indigenous affairs reporter, will look at the complexities and who is making these decisions and how. CORNER BROOK, N.L.—Retired master corporal Matthew Connolly has spread his prized spiritual possessions on his dining room table.\\n\\nMatthew Connolly in Corner Brook. Connolly grew up knowing he is a direct descendant of Mattie Mitchell, who is recognized as a founding father of the Mi’kmaq in western Newfoundland. But he was shocked to fall short on the point system to recognize membership in the Qalipu First Nation. ( Tom Cochrane / For the Toronto Star )\\n\\nHe carefully touches each as he explains its significance. He starts with a beautifully carved drumstick made from the wood of an old sweat lodge. Then he unrolls the red leather case that holds his eagle feather, given for service to the community. He moves to a hand-held drum, then a smudge kit, then a satchel of tobacco. From his wallet, he retrieves a small, laminated white card to show the words “Teluisi Kelusit Paqtism” — Speaking Wolf, Connolly’s Mi’kmaq name. He grew up proud knowing he is a direct descendant of Mattie Mitchell, the revered trader and explorer who is recognized as a founding father of the Mi’kmaq in western Newfoundland, likely arriving here in the 1700s from Cape Breton. Connolly, 57, may believe he is indigenous but the government of Canada does not. Connolly was one of 82,630 people who received a letter dated Jan. 31, 2017, from Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, denying his application for membership in the Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation, a landless band headquartered in Corner Brook, Newfoundland.\\n\\nArticle Continued Below\\n\\nHis rejection came at the end of an unprecedented enrolment drive that saw 101,000 claiming Mi’kmaq ancestry and applying to join the Qalipu, a band made up of nearly a dozen Newfoundland indigenous communities. Applicants were judged on a points system developed by six government representatives and six from the Federation of Newfoundland Indians (FNI) to assess how Mi’kmaq someone is. Thirteen points grants membership. Points were given to those who live in one of Newfoundland’s 66 Mi’kmaq communities, and to those who could prove they were culturally involved with the Mi’kmaq before June 2008, when the federal government officially recognized the Qalipu. Points were also given if applicants could produce affidavits that they had engaged in activities such as hunting and powwows, and if they had airline receipts to show frequent visits to Mi’kmaq areas. But how and why points were given to some but not others has caused endless confusion and can border on the absurd. In many families, some siblings were accepted and others rejected. In the case of twin toddlers, one gained membership and the other did not. The first president of the Federation of Newfoundland Indians was rejected and so was a recent Indspire Awards recipient. Indspire Awards are handed out only to indigenous people. The 100,000 applicants came from across Canada and beyond — from Hong Kong, California and Australia — all claiming Mi’kmaq ancestry. But Ottawa and the Qalipu band council agreed “it was neither reasonable nor credible” to expect that all of them would become members of the First Nation, “particularly given that approximately two-thirds of the applicants did not reside in any of the Mi’kmaq communities targeted for recognition in this initiative,” Qalipu’s website states. Connolly’s rejection was blunt: “You did not meet the requirements for acceptance by the Mi’kmaq group of Indians of Newfoundland.”\\n\\nHe only received three points. This stunned Connolly, who has a home in Corner Brook, has participated in cultural events and powwows and has worked for the Qalipu band. He believes multiple mistakes were made when his application was assessed and is “emotionally devastated.”\\n\\nQalipu Chief Brendan Mitchell says the recognition formula has torn his community apart. ( Qalipu First Nation )\\n\\n“I have been Mi’kmaq all my life. This blows me away,” says Connolly, whose rejection means his Indian Status card — assigned by the government identifying him as an indigenous Canadian entitled to benefits such as free prescription drugs and tax exemptions — will be suddenly void once the Qalipu membership list becomes official in 2018.\\n\\nArticle Continued Below\\n\\n“Talk about making you feel as if you are nothing,” says Connolly, who worked in Canada’s army, navy and air force, finishing his career as an instructor on safety training. “It makes you feel useless. Mattie Mitchell was my fourth great-grandfather. I have every piece of document I needed.” Connolly’s cousin is the current chief of the Qalipu First Nation, Brendan Mitchell, who was accepted. However, some of Mitchell’s siblings and Connolly’s siblings were not. All Connolly can do now is appeal and wait for Ottawa to decide if he is indigenous, regardless of what his heart says. The Mi’kmaq fight for recognition began in 1949 when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Confederation and Premier Joey Smallwood famously pronounced that there were “no Indians on the island of Newfoundland.” That proclamation, however wrong, meant the Mi’kmaq were automatically excluded from the Indian Act — legislation from 1876 that governs indigenous life, including the criteria for who belongs and who does not. The Indian Act does not have a point system to determine who is indigenous and who isn’t — that is unique to the Qalipu process. Section 6 of the Indian Act determines who is a Status Indian, registered on the government’s list of indigenous people. However, the act is a flawed, paternalistic piece of legislation. It allows the government to decide indigenous ancestry, and the act decreed that status was handed down through the male line only. It wasn’t until a court challenge that this was changed in 1985, but many indigenous women are still fighting to gain official status. A slight, friendly man with a sharp nose and dark eyes, Brendan Mitchell, 62, thinks this enrolment drive is “disgusting.” He has spent years trying to get the indigenous and northern affairs ministry, now led by Carolyn Bennett, to stop this poorly understood point formula . His community is being torn apart — pitting brother against sister, husband against wife, neighbour against neighbour. “Is this what they mean by truth and reconciliation?” Mitchell asks. Corner Brook is an anglo-dominated village, dotted with brightly coloured homes hidden behind snow banks that often reach one storey high in the winter. The local Tim Hortons is always packed, and a Japanese restaurant offers cod tempura. Corner Brook’s winding, hilly roads fall under the shadow of the Corner Brook Pulp and Paper Mill, one of the largest employers in this town of 20,000.\\n\\nCalvin White, an elder of the Flat Bay band on the island. \"We are a true Indian self-government,\" he says, calling the point system \"idiotic.\" ( Tom Cochrane/ For the Toronto Star )\\n\\nFor hundreds of years, Newfoundlanders kept their indigenous heritage hidden. But even so, Smallwood’s pronouncement fell like a blanket across the island, suppressing the Mi’kmaq culture, beliefs and traditions even though there is evidence that indigenous people have been on the island since the 1600s. Often families just didn’t talk about it. One municipal worker says she was stunned when her application was accepted — she had no idea she was indigenous until she stumbled upon her family’s history. “My grandfather never even knew about it,” says the woman, who refused to identify herself because members of her family were rejected and are appealing. “They hid it because of racism. But we were suspicious. He knew his plants, his prayers and it was his looks and the way he did things,” she says. Connolly says “racism wasn’t a word we used growing up.” He hid his identity from his classmates. “Everything was clique-y — the Indians lived on one side of town, the Catholics on the other. But if you said you are Indian, you’d get beat up in the schoolyard,” he says. But there were indigenous communities all over the island, especially on the west coast — in Stephenville, St. George’s, Flat Bay, Deer Lake and Conne River. In 1973, the communities united to form the Federation of Newfoundland Indians, headed by John Oliver and then Calvin White, to fight for recognition, as without it they were not part of the Indian Act, they held no treaty land and received no special benefits as other Status Indians do. In 1984, Ottawa gave status to all the members of Miawpukek First Nation, a community along the Conne River in southern Newfoundland, the first — and until the Qalipu, the only — Newfoundland nation recognized. In 1989, the federation took the government to court seeking eligibility under the Indian Act. In 2008, an agreement created a landless band, which after a contest, took the name Qalipu (Mi’kmaq for caribou). During an enrolment process, 23,877 applicants were accepted as members. Between Nov. 30, 2009, and Sept. 22, 2011, 4,000 more applications were received. But then unpredictably, in the 14 months before the deadline of Nov. 30, 2012, applications surged by another 70,000 applications as word got out about an enrolment drive, according to government records. Something wasn’t right. In 2013, the Qalipu and the government signed a supplemental deal to reassess every person who had been accepted or who wanted to be. A committee was made up of equal representatives from the federation and the ministry. It established the points system. Applicants had four years to assemble their paperwork and the deadline was June 30, 2016. Once again, more than 100,000 applied. (Everyone who applied before had to reapply.) Mitchell knows there are those who want to get something for nothing, people who have applied but don’t have a trace of Mi’kmaq blood. “One woman stopped me at a restaurant where I was having dinner with my wife,” he says. “She told me that she applied. I was surprised and said, ‘I didn’t know you had indigenous blood.’ She said she didn’t. But she wanted the tax breaks.”\\n\\nEveryone in Flat Bay is indigenous, though it\\'s not technically a reserve. But most members who moved away were denied membership in the Qalipu. ( Tom Cochrane/ For the Toronto Star )\\n\\nOn Jan. 31, 2017, the letters went out: 18,044 members had been accepted, 68,134 were rejected and 3,984 applications were deemed invalid. Among the rejections were 10,512 Qalipu members who did not meet the minimum points. Like Connolly, they will lose their Status Indian cards in 2018 when the final membership list is presented to Parliament. “I begged (Indigenous Affairs) Minister Bennett not to do this,” says Mitchell. “These people have had their cards for five years and they’ll lose them.” The biggest reason for rejection is the failure to live in a Mi’kmaq community, explained Fred Caron, the ministerial special adviser at Indigenous and Northern Affairs who is handling the membership drive. “You need to have a strong cultural connection,” Caron said in a teleconference call with reporters after the rejection letters were sent. “The high threshold will likely be difficult to meet if they don’t live in the community.” Rejection letters, like the one Connolly received, outline each decision and include how the enrolment committee allocated the points in each individual case. In Connolly’s case, he received 0 points for “frequent visit to members of a location of the Mi’kmaq Group of Indians of Newfoundland” (worth up to four points depending on strength of evidence and the frequency of the visits). Only rejected applicants who received an appeal notice along with their Jan. 31 letter are invited to appeal. The appeals have to be mailed in by March 31 and will be heard by “a legal team of appeals masters” before a decision is sent out, the Qalipu website says. No other Indian Act nation stipulates that members must live in the community or face losing their status. People move, says Mitchell, whose brother, a lawyer in Halifax, was rejected, along with his sister in Toronto. Calvin White is an elder of the Flat Bay band, which is based about an hour’s drive southwest of Corner Brook. Flat Bay is a fishing community of 314 on the windy Atlantic shore. Every person who lives in Flat Bay is indigenous but their community is not classified as a reserve. “I don’t think there is another aboriginal community anywhere in this country that has the unique structure that Flat Bay has,” White says. “We are not a municipality. We incorporated as a band council. We do not receive any core funding from any level of government, either provincially or federally, yet we are the only government in this community. We are a true Indian self-government.” When White and John Oliver began the Federation of Newfoundland Indians, he never expected it would end like this. About 500 Flat Bay members “live away,” he says, mostly young people who moved for school or careers. Most received rejection letters. “Those are the people we are really concerned about,” White says. “We are totally opposed to the idiotic point system. That is not how you define a person’s heritage, lifestyle or who they are. “All of those people who are away are mostly people who are under 50,” he says. “The band was a promoter of that. We didn’t have any economic opportunity in our community. We have no land claim to pursue economic development. “School is where you need to be. You can’t fight the battle with ignorance, without knowledge. But to punish those people and tell them they are no longer Indians because they don’t live in Flat Bay — that is a crime.”\\n\\nA bingo fundraiser at a Mi\\'kmaq community centre in St. George\\'s, where the Mi\\'kmaq go back four centuries. ( Tom Cochrane/ For the Toronto Star )\\n\\nFlat Bay has produced medical professionals, lawyers, RCMP officers, teachers. White raised six children. His daughter Judy White is a lawyer and the CEO of the Assembly of First Nations. Three of Calvin White’s sons were rejected, but Judy was not. They all live away. Also rejected was John Oliver, the first president of the Federation of Newfoundland Indians. Oliver is retired and lives in Okanagan Valley in B.C., to be close to his grandson, who has special needs, but he calls White every month. “He is a founding member, a man who contributed,” White says. “He was the president of the federation and he was denied.” Up the jagged coast of the Appalachian Mountains lies the picturesque, tiny community of St. George’s, a former French fishery village famous for its blueberries. The Mi’kmaq here can be traced back nearly four centuries. Here, Odelle Pike waits patiently for mail. “I haven’t got my letter. My children have,” Pike says. “They kept their status. But my sisters, their kids, they’ve lost it.” Pike and six of her siblings were at a former Anglican church that is now a Mi’kmaq community centre, preparing for a bingo fundraiser. Off the top, she couldn’t recall how many of her 19 siblings lost their status, except that most of those who had left were rejected. “My sister Aileen, she just won an Indspire award (for indigenous Canadians who make a difference). She lives in Fort McMurray. She lost her status. Her husband was chief of the Indian Crossing First Nation near Stephenville, New Brunswick, from 1990 to 1998, and he lost his status,” she says. “My other sister who works for aboriginal justice in Ontario, she lost her status. I have oodles of nieces and nephews who lost status. Really, there is no rhyme or reason.” Pike is president of the Newfoundland Aboriginal Women’s Network, involved in working to prevent violence against women, and raising awareness. The group was working flat out to get St. George’s women’s applications in before the deadline. “We have a high illiteracy rate here,” she says. “People didn’t understand what was going on, how to fill the forms out. “There is so much upheaval in our communities now. I can’t explain it. It is like somebody died. Where do we go from here? The federal government is breaking all the rules. There are human rights — people are allowed to move. Nowhere else in Canada do you go through this process. The Qalipu are still being discriminated against.”\\n\\nIn St. George\\'s, the Newfoundland village where the Mi\\'kmaq presence goes back four centuries, Odelle Pike is waiting for her letter. The president of the Newfoundland Aboriginal Women\\'s Network has seen some in her family accepted and some rejected. ( Tom Cochrane/ For the Toronto Star )\\n\\nHow can two people in the same family receive opposite decisions? Newfoundland-born Jerry Le Roux, who moved to Ontario, filled out identical applications for himself, his son and twin daughters, VOCM reported. Le Roux told the radio station his son was rejected with 11 points. One twin was accepted with 13; the other twin struck out with six. Right now 10,000 people from Corner Brook are members of Qalipu, noted Kelly Anne Butler, the aboriginal affairs officer and aboriginal adjunct professor at Memorial University’s Grenfell campus. Before the 2008 agreement, Corner Brook did not have the high percentages of people identifying themselves as Mi’kmaq like in other communities such as Flat Bay or Conne River. “But in Corner Brook, there was an explosion of numbers, of people who weren’t members of the (Federation of Newfoundland Indians) but then applied to Qalipu,” she says. “They have legitimate ancestry but I don’t know if all of them would say, ‘I’m a Mi’kmaq person’ but that they are of Mi’kmaq ancestry. You have longtime members and you have people who either didn’t have an interest before or who didn’t know and started doing research, then joined the band.” That 100,000 applied doesn’t shock Butler. “This is an island. Everyone is related to everyone. I totally believe 100,000 have the ancestry. How close it is to them is another story.” The Joseph Boyden identity controversy hasn’t done them any favours, she adds. Boyden, the celebrated Canadian novelist who has told stories rooted in indigenous life and claims he has indigenous roots, was the subject of an Aboriginal Peoples Television Network investigation in December. The story maintained Boyden’s indigenous ancestry was overblown. “We, as a group of applicants, have been challenged so much over the last decade,” Butler says. “So when the APTN piece came out, at first, I felt really bad for him. But then it kept getting worse and worse and now I think he is part of the reason why we are being challenged. “When you have this large group of newly acknowledged ancestry, those are the ones everyone focuses on and so we all get called ‘wannabes,’ ‘pretendians’ or ‘Air Miles Indians,’ all sorts of negative things. No one deserves that — even the people who are just finding out about their heritage,” she says. “And now, 10,512 of them are getting it taken away. Maybe if we could go back in time we could say they shouldn’t have got it in the first place but I’m not going to say that. But it’s been years now and now the government is taking it away. That is cultural trauma. Their identity is being taken away.”',\n",
       " 'Almost forty years ago, on March 2, 1978, Oona Chaplin got a call from the local police. Three months earlier, her husband Charlie Chaplin—the British star of silent films and early “talkies”—had died peacefully at their home near Corsier-sur-Vevey, by Lake Geneva in Switzerland. He was 88. Oona, his fourth wife, and their eight children had buried him in a quiet cemetery by their home.\\n\\nThat was what the police were calling about.\\n\\n\"They said, look, somebody dug up the grave and he\\'s gone,” Chaplin’s son, Eugene, later recalled to the Independent.\\n\\nThat was the beginning of one of the most spectacularly unsuccessful body snatchings in history. The thieves soon called the home with their terms. They wanted the equivalent of about $600,000 for the safe return of Chaplin’s body and threatened the lives of the couple’s young children should their demands not be met.\\n\\nOona would have nothing to do with it. \"Charlie would have thought it rather ridiculous,\" she said, according to Mental Floss.\\n\\nBut the body-snatchers were desperate and the local police diligent. In May of that year, expecting another call from the crooks, police had Oona’s phone tapped and every one of the area’s 200 phone booths monitored by detectives. The efforts paid out, and two mechanics and political refugees from Eastern Europe, Roman Wardas and Gantscho Ganev, were finally nabbed.\\n\\nAfter the two led the authorities to the cornfield where they had temporarily re-buried Chaplin, they were prosecuted for grave robbing and attempted extortion. Wardas, the reported \"mastermind,\" was sentenced to four years, while Ganev got an 18-month suspended sentence.\\n\\nBoth appeared somewhat sorry for their crimes. Eugene told the Independent that both graverobbers wrote letters to his mother, who was ready to let bygones be bygones. \"The wife of the nicer one wrote and said \\'We\\'re so sorry\\'. My mother wrote back and said: \\'Look, all is forgiven.\\'\"\\n\\nAs for poor Charlie, he was reburied in his original plot. This time, however, the family opted for a concrete coating over the grave to deter any future robberies. Though a 2014 French film on the ordeal called The Price of Fame reawakened interest in the case, for the last four decades, as far as anyone knows, the comedian has been resting quietly in peace.',\n",

This is the world of adventure imagined and glorified in sci-fi magazines and novels of the 40\\'s and 50\\'s, by science fiction authors and artists whose legacies include John Carter of Mars, Carson of Venus, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tom Corbett: Space Cadet, Perry Rhodan and many more. In this future world, humans have conquered space and found a new frontier beyond our imagination.\\n\\nStacy Davidson\\n\\nDavidson’s love of computer games began at the age of eight with the introduction of a TI-99/4A computer into his household. He later developed a short Extended Basic text adventure called The Quest, followed by many simple arcade and RPG game prototypes on his Commodore 64. He spent a year in Quality Assurance at Origin Systems/EA, published his own shareware game called Shadow of the Lost Citadel, and has spent the last eleven years working in motion pictures as a producer, director, cinematographer, editor, sound designer and visual effects supervisor at his own studio, Odyssee Pictures. In 2010, his fan-game project Han Solo Adventures was featured in Star Wars: Uncut and The People vs. George Lucas. Now at the helm of his new game studio, Davidson is looking forward to exploring the adventure genre in his never ending quest to recapture the glorious days when mysteries were solved and legends born one click at a time.\\n\\nYou can check out Davidson\\'s work with a trailer for his horror film Sweatshop, and his music video for the metal band Outworld (because metal. \\\\m/etal!!)\\n\\nThe Team\\n\\nStacy Davidson is an accomplished effects artist and game designer, but he is also counting on the help of a small team of artists. The level of involvement of other team members will depend on the level of funding we achieve. We have already tapped the talent of concept artists Patrick Reilly, Mitchell Malloy, Giacomo Tappainer and Mike Oliver, and would love to continue to utilize them.\\n\\nWe also have at our disposal a team of effects artists including Mike Oliver, Kristi Boul and Marcus Koch, all of whom have extensive experience in sculpting, molding and casting, and who all have their own valuable creative vision to offer, as well as helping to speed up the process immensely.\\n\\nIain Kelso\\n\\nInternationally acclaimed composer Iain Kelso has already begun work on a riveting original score for Jack Houston. His score for the feature film Jacob, produced by Odyssee Pictures and featuring Michael Biehn (The Terminator, Aliens, Tombstone, The Divide), recently won the Platinum Award at WorldFest International Film Festival. Samples of his work can be heard here.\\n\\nThe Production\\n\\nIn film production, it\\'s always the same deal. We pitch a project to investors, raise money, make the movie, and then cross our fingers that we will a) get a great domestic distribution deal, b) have lots of luck at the international markets selling foreign rights, and c) become profitable enough to repay all our investors and make enough for ourselves to launch another picture. That way of working is frankly crazy. With Kickstarter, you as the fans and players can make a project like this a reality by backing it ahead of time and, as long as we do our job, there\\'s no taking chances on market fluctuations, agent fees, greedy distributors, tea leaves, fortune cookies or the ramblings of the Voodoo Lady at the International House of Mojo. We get to create the best game possible and put it right into the hands of the very fans who backed us. No middle men what so ever. Within three weeks of the project being funded, we will go into production full time and begin filling YOU in with regular updates and behind-the-scenes videos keeping you involved in the project every step of the way. You\\'ll have exclusive access to the dev team through the private backers\\' forum, and high level backers will even have certain perks including quarterly producer reports and the opportunity to vote on critical in-game content.\\n\\nPlatforms and Localization\\n\\nAt the base goal, we will be using Adventure Game Studio as the base engine, which supports PC and has limited support for Linux. If we continue that path, we will do all we can to support Linux at launch, within the capabilities of that engine, and begin work on a Mac port after launch.\\n\\nHowever, we are also formulating a stretch goal that will allow us to develop the game using a different engine that will fully support PC, Mac and Linux at first launch, then iPad and Android tablets soon after. We are committed to seeing Jack on multiple platforms no matter what, but exceeding our funding goals will allow us to do so immediately at launch.\\n\\nAt the base goal, the game will be released with English voice over and on-screen text. We are currently formulating a small, attainable stretch goal that will allow us to translate the game text into many other languages at launch. Again, we are committed to supporting as many languages as possible. If we do not attain this goal, other languages will follow sometime after launch.\\n\\nKicking it Forward\\n\\nWe solemnly pledge 5% of the profits from the finished product back to the Kickstarter community to help fund other people\\'s dreams. http://kickingitforward.org\\n\\nWe want all our backers to be super excited about being a part of Jack Houston and the Necronauts!\\n\\nDigital Rewards\\n\\nAt the basic $15 level, we will get you a download code for the full game, DRM-FREE, which will include an in-game designer commentary audio track, a new HD wallpaper every month, exclusive access to beta-testing and access to our private forum community and video updates for backers-only. At $30 we\\'ll throw in a digital download of the original score. At $60 you\\'ll also get a PDF of \"Crafting the World of Jack Houston and the Necronauts\" which chronicles the complete development process covering sculpting, molding/casting, stop motion animation, miniature building and game development.\\n\\nWe also have a special \"ALL-DIGITAL INTERNATIONAL PACKAGE\" at $95 which gives you a huge assortment of nifty digital rewards for international backers who\\'d rather not mess with pesky customs issues.\\n\\nPhysical Rewards\\n\\nAfter that, the rewards start to get physical...\\n\\nAttribution & Gratitude\\n\\nSome public domain video clips were used courtesy of NASA.\\n\\nAll concept art is the work of Patrick Reilly, Mitchell Malloy, Giacomo Tappainer and Mike Oliver.\\n\\nExamples of the Jack Houston team visual effects work featured shots from Psychic Experiment (A.K.A. \"Walking Distance\") featuring Debbie Rochon, Glenn Morshower, Katie Featherston, Reggie Bannister and Adrienne King, from Upstart Filmworks and Lionsgate Entertainment, written and directed by Mel House. More info here.\\n\\nSome music created by Jack Houston composer Iain Kelso was used courtesy Odyssee Pictures from the feature film Jacob.\\n\\nVoice over work was provided by professional voice actor Otis Twelve, and recorded courtesy of Vince Twelve, creator of the spectacular new adventure game Resonance from XII Games and Wadjet Eye Games (which also features Otis Twelve, and effects work from Odyssee Pictures/Warbird Games, check it out!)\\n\\nJoin Team Jack!\\n\\nThis project means more to me than you can know. The story is pure Edgar Rice Burroughs pulp adventure, the art design is a Frazetta-fueled dream (Frank Frazetta happens to be our lead concept artist Patrick Reilly\\'s biggest influence), the environment and creatures will be right out of a Harryhausen movie, and just wait \\'til you hear the way this soundtrack is shaping up. It\\'s the grab a ray gun, hop in a rocket and blast off to Venus fantasy I\\'ve seen in my head ever since I first laid eyes on Amazing Stories magazine, and heard my first episodes of X Minus One and Tom Corbett: Space Cadet.\\n\\nI truly can\\'t wait to get started on Jack Houston, so please grab a bubble helmet, holster your ray gun, and fire up the engines because this is surely going to be one seriously kick ass ride!\\n\\n~Stacy Davidson',\n",

       " 'Google\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO--Google Wallet is growing up and it\\'s not just about paying for stuff by tapping your phone anymore.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the company made three announcements at its Google I/O developer conference with regard to Google Wallet that take the service well beyond specialized tap and go technology to make Google Wallet more usable on the Web.\\n\\n\"We are not pulling away from NFC,\" Peter Hazlehurst, director of product management for Google Wallet said in an interview. \"We are simply making a much richer Wallet experience. There are still places where NFC can\\'t be used. And not every device has it yet.\"\\n\\nStill, Hazlehurst said he thinks that NFC\\'s time will come. And in the future as the technology proliferates, it will become more useful. In the meantime, there are a lot of things that Google can do to make the online buying experience, whether it\\'s from a mobile device or from a desktop or laptop computer, easier and more streamlined.\\n\\nPayments via Gmail\\n\\nThe first new feature is the ability to send money to and from Google Wallet via e-mail. Google also issued APIs, or application programming interfaces, that developers can use to access Google Wallet and make buying stuff within Android apps and on the Web easier for consumers by stream-lining the process and allowing customers to avoid re-entering payment information. And finally, Google has created APIs that developers can use to allow merchants to add easy access to loyalty cards and programs.\\n\\nThe e-mail payment functionality is probably the most interesting of the three announcements since it finally makes it as easy to make a digital payment to a friend or anyone else as it is to attach a photo or document in an e-mail.\\n\\nYou can even send money to people who aren\\'t using Gmail. And it\\'s free to send money if your bank account is linked to your Google Wallet or by using a Google Wallet prepaid account. Service fees apply for sending a money using a Google Wallet linked credit card or debit card.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works. To send money in Gmail, hover over the attachment paperclip, click the \"$\" icon to attach money to your message, enter the amount you wish to send, and press send.\\n\\nSending money via Gmail is currently available only on the desktop. To send money via a phone you can go to the Google Wallet mobile site at wallet.google.com. In order to send or receive money, you will need to set up a Google Wallet account. And the e-mail money transfers only work for money sent within the U.S.\\n\\nGoogle\\n\\nGoogle\\'s Hazlehurst said that consumers shouldn\\'t worry about security issues when sending money via Gmail. The company offers the Google Wallet Purchase Protection plan, which covers users 100 percent against eligible unauthorized payments. And he said that no actual account information is transferred via e-mail.\\n\\nThe feature will be rolling out over the coming months throughout the U.S. to users over the age of 18. You can also get access to the \"$\" attachment icon if a friend has the feature and sends money to you.\\n\\nInstant Buy\\n\\nGoogle also announced the new Instant Buy API for developers to help streamline the online buying experience. The new API will allow app developers and Web developers to use Google+ single-sign on technology to provide all the user and credit card information necessary when buying physical goods within an app or online.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, consumers can purchase things from an app or online store with just a couple of clicks. The company and one of its initial Instant Buy partners, Priceline, showed off how easy this process can be during a demonstration at a Google developer session here today.\\n\\nThe way to think of it is a more streamlined PayPal button for Google users. Google has already signed up several partners including Airbnb, Booking.com, Uber, and Expedia, who will all integrate the functionality into their apps.\\n\\nGoogle claims that the new functionality not only makes it easier for consumers to complete their purchases, but it\\'s also more secure. How? The merchants themselves never get access to the full the full credit card number, which means that sensitive account information isn\\'t stored on multiple merchant Websites.\\n\\nGoogle\\n\\nGoogle Wallet Objects API\\n\\nThe company also announced it will allow Google Wallet users to include any loyalty card in their Google Wallet. Previous implementations of Google Wallet have been limited in the loyalty cards that could be added to the digital wallet. Now consumers can add loyalty cards and other items into the wallet, including tickets.\\n\\nThe capability is similar to what Apple has introduced as part of its Passbook capability. But Google\\'s Hazlehurst says it goes a bit further.\\n\\nGoogle is also offering an API for developers to make signing up for those loyalty cards easier. It will also give brands that use the API to develop functionality into their mobile apps the ability to leverage other Google services to make redeeming offers or pushing offers to consumers easier. Specifically, this might mean using geofencing technology to know when a customer is in the vicinity and sending him a special offer.\\n\\nGoogle is already working with several brands, including Alaska Airlines, The Body Shop, BJs Restaurants, Marriott Rewards, and RetailMeNot.',\n",

       " 'We’ve all had the thought cross our mind while flying, “What if the pilot(s) somehow became incapacitated and I had to land this thing? What would I do?” Or maybe more timely for today’s world, “What if a terrorist takes over the plane and I have to save the day by knocking him out with a Chuck Norris-style thump to the head?”\\n\\nYou’re a hero, boo-yah! But, if the pilot’s unconscious, you may have to get the plane on the ground. Relax, it’s not as hard as it looks and if you follow a few simple steps you’ll be on the ground safely and in one piece for your press conference and hero shots.\\n\\nMaintain Aircraft Control (Straight and Level)\\n\\nWhen you first arrive in the cockpit take the left seat if possible; this is generally where the Captain or Aircraft Commander sits and often has easier access to some of the instruments you’ll need to fly. However, the majority of dual-seat aircraft can be flown from either side.\\n\\nAs soon as you sit down take a deep breath and look outside to see if the aircraft is in a dive (you see more ground in the windscreen than sky), climb, turn, etc. If it appears to be straight and level then don’t touch the flight controls, the autopilot is most likely on and there’s no need to interfere. If, however, the airplane is racing towards the ground or in a steep turn, then you need to use the stick or yoke (pilot speak for steering wheel) to bring it back to wings-level flight. Just like in the video games, you pull back on the yoke to make the airplane climb, push forward to make it descend, and turn it right or left to turn.\\n\\nIf you are in the clouds and can’t tell the attitude of the aircraft (that is, its relation to the horizon), then it will be necessary to use the attitude indicator, also referred to as the artificial horizon. This is an instrument that gives a representation of the aircraft in relation to the ground and sky. If you’re on a jet of some sort, chances are high that it will be displayed on the screen directly in front of you. The “w” shape in the middle represents the wings of the aircraft, the brown represents ground, and the blue represents sky. So if you see half brown, half blue it means you are in level flight which is what you want. If you see anything else, then make corrections with the stick as necessary to line up the wings of the aircraft with the horizon line.\\n\\nMake a Radio Call\\n\\nAfter you have the aircraft under control, the next step is to contact Air Traffic Control (ATC) over the radio to explain the situation and ask for help. The majority of aircrafts have a radio mic switch on the yoke on the back where your index finger would rest when you grasped it normally. The problem is that the autopilot disconnect switch is often placed on the yoke as well and without proper knowledge of the autopilot system, an inadvertent disconnect of the autopilot could result in a major disaster. A safer alternative is using the hand-held radio normally mounted to the left of the pilot’s seat just below the side window. Use it just like you would use a CB radio, push to talk and release to listen.\\n\\nTry making a call on the radio frequency currently selected and see if you get a response. Say “Mayday” and state who you are and what has happened. Don’t worry about radio etiquette, it’s an emergency so just use plain English and tell them you don’t know what you’re doing and need some help, but don’t sound too panicked. You’re a man after all, and completely in control of the situation.\\n\\nAfter talking, remember to release the mic button to listen. If no one responds, try changing the VHF radio frequency to 121.5 MHz (this is known as “Guard” and is monitored by everyone). The radio unit will normally be located on the center pedestal in between the pilot’s and co-pilot’s seats or directly in front of you on the center panel.\\n\\nDo What They Tell You\\n\\nJust like in the movies, what happens next is that various agencies will be notified of your emergency and they will find someone who is an expert for your plane to walk you through getting it on the ground. They will know the cockpit layout and be able to tell you where a button or switch is located and what you need to do with it. They will also be working in conjunction with ATC to navigate you to an airport where you will be able to land. As long as you follow their instructions to the letter everything should turn out just fine. You may not have the prettiest landing, but you’ll survive.\\n\\nGet It on the Ground\\n\\nThe reality is that many of today’s jets are fully-automated and have the capability to land themselves or at least get you lined up on the runway center line on a proper glide path so that you can take over at 50-100 feet off the ground. All you will have to manually do is:\\n\\nFlare (pull up slightly on the stick just prior to touchdown so the main gear hit first)\\n\\nFly the nosewheel to the ground (push the stick forward until the front touches down)\\n\\nPull the throttles all the way back\\n\\nStep on the brakes, which are located on the tops of the rudder pedals down by your feet.\\n\\nIf you find yourself veering off the runway, lightly step on the rudder pedals to steer yourself back to centerline\\n\\nNotes, Warnings, Cautions\\n\\nYou’ve landed! It’s incredible; you’re now the hero of the day, congratulations! Now before you go patting yourself on the back in your imaginary scenario, here are a few additional things to consider:\\n\\nGetting the landing gear down before landing is obviously a key part of the process, but has been forgotten by countless pilots. The gear handle is almost always located just to the right of the center console on the front instrument panel, basically just above the left knee of the co-pilot if he were sitting there.',\n",
       " 'LOMA MAR — A 77-year-old concrete dam is now gone from San Mateo County’s Pescadero Creek, opening a route for rare coho salmon to once again return to their ancestral habitat.\\n\\nThe dam created a popular swimming hole at Memorial Park in the redwood forests of the Santa Cruz Mountains, where kids floated on air mattresses in the chilly waters and searched for crayfish.\\n\\nBut it prevented the fish from making their swim from the Pacific Ocean to freshwater pools to spawn. The coho was listed as endangered in 2005 and is now on the brink of extinction.\\n\\nThe dam was demolished in October by a team led by the San Mateo County Resource Conservation District and San Mateo County Parks Department — and December rains have restored the creeks natural contours, opening up 62 miles of creek habitat to the fish.\\n\\n“We’re trying to give them a fighting chance, where they come to spawn,” said Kellyx Nelson, executive director of the San Mateo County Resource Conservation District, based in Half Moon Bay.\\n\\n“We’re doing everything in our power to make sure they have the right habitat to feed, grow fat and lay their eggs before going back out to sea,” she said.\\n\\nThe dam was built in 1938 to provide a swimming hole near the confluence of Peterson and McCormick creeks, part of the Works Progress Administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal to combat unemployment in the Great Depression.\\n\\nBut it created an insurmountable barrier for fish in the coastal creek. The dam wall was too high for fish to jump when traveling upstream. And its narrow chute forced a fierce flow of water, too strong to overcome. And it prevented the downstream flow of gravel, essential for fish to lay eggs. An additional problem — also now fixed, as part of this restoration project — was created by a 1930s-era road crossing, designed to provide vehicle access to the park’s Sequoia Flat Family Camp.\\n\\n“These are great projects which benefit fish — the result of many years of planning, layers of initiatives,” said Marlene Finley, director of the San Mateo Parks Department.\\n\\nOnce Pescadero Creek — whose name is Spanish for fish merchant — teemed with coho salmon, as well as steelhead trout. While steelhead are still found in Pescadero Creek, coho were believed to have vanished from its waters.\\n\\nCoho, also known as silver salmon, are born in cold freshwater streams like Pescadero Creek, where they live for a year before swimming to the ocean. Then they return to lay eggs and fertilize them.\\n\\nLast winter, to great excitement, biologists spotted three coho salmon that had recently spawned, including a 26-inch female. Those adult fish are believed to have originated in Santa Cruz County’s Kingfisher Flat Hatchery on Big Creek, a project of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and state fisheries.\\n\\nBut no fry were detected.\\n\\nThis is the fifth barrier to be removed by the San Mateo County Resource Conservation District since 2007. The project received about $280,000 in funding from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, with additional funding and effort from the conservation district and the San Mateo County Parks and Recreation Foundation.\\n\\nOf previous projects, the most formidable was the 2013 removal of a century-old 40-foot-wide concrete barrier from a section of the creek in El Palo Alto Park on the Palo Alto-Menlo Park border, restoring the streambed to a more natural course.\\n\\nAs winter rains deposit necessary gravel and cause the newly restored creek to swell, biologists will watch closely for the fish to return.\\n\\n“This is the time of year that we might start to see fish migrate up creeks,” said Nelson. “I’m hoping.”',\n",
       " 'There is an obscure writing dating back to 921 AD. Known as the Ibn Fadian manuscript, this incredible story gives us our earliest account of the Viking culture. There is a controversy naturally over such a work of antiquity spanning centuries. This fact alone ensures that it would be argued over. Despite many opinions over its authenticity by scholars of different nations and universities and even a reverent recreation of the original manuscript in the thirteenth century, this incredible story has survived the ages partially incomplete, but amazingly intact. In this manuscript is an Arab’s depiction of his true life experiences over a 3 year span in the company of Vikings. It reads like something out of “Jason and the Argonauts” or ”The Adventures of the Brave Ulysses” yet it is an amazingly true to life tale of an Arab’s first-hand account of Viking life, their society, and the amazing saga that Ibn Fadian experienced among them.\\n\\nIf you missed part I click here: http://www.ufodigest.com/article/ufos-vikings-part-i-0628\\n\\nFrom a Book entitled “A Collection of Three Novels” by Michael Crichton, “Eaters of the Dead” is an intriguing account of Norsemen, their day to day village life, their incredible skills in battle, and Ibn Fadian’s personal impressions of the Norsemen which becomes a mixture of being aghast at their personal hygiene and warrior mentality, to eventually his ultimate admiration for those he shared 3 years of his life with. June of A.D. 921 the Caliph of Bagdad ordered Ahmad Ibn Fadian, a messenger to act as an ambassador to the King of Bulgars, but Ibn never completed his mission. Along the way he was intercepted by a party of Viking warriors and taken as an accompanying captive, but soon became fascinated by the Vikings and sometimes repulsed by their odd customs. After a time Ibn, who was of Muslim faith, came to fight alongside the Vikings and overcome many doubts he had about his own abilities in doing so.\\n\\nIbn Fadian’s skill at documenting what he saw\\n\\nIbn was befriended by Herger, a massive warrior who had the skills of an interpreter. Herger served as a translator for Ibn between himself and the leader of the Vikings Buliwyf, another valiant fighter. Unlike many of our earliest tales of adventure told to instill principles and illustrate proper morality by heroes faced with challenges and danger to be sung as entertainment for the listener, Ibn Fadian was a gifted writer whose mission was to report. Thus, this manuscript is a factual account written as a reference for his king to be informed of foreign society’s daily life and ultimate intentions toward other nations. Therefore “Eaters of the Dead” is more like a diary of Fadian’s experiences. Even in this light, the manuscript is no less entertaining than a fictional account embellished with wild fantasies. In fact, the most amazing thing about “Eaters of the Dead” is the fact that it is not a tall tale at all but the very real account of events that are nothing short of remarkable.\\n\\nImpressions of Viking life\\n\\nWhen Ibn was initially brought to the Viking village, the home of the Norsemen who had taken him in, Fadian was appalled at the conduct of these war-like people. Men and women according to Ibn defecated anywhere without cleaning themselves. The men often copulated spontaneously with a woman right in the midst of the public and among others. Supposedly many of those who ran a farm slept on earthen floors alongside their animals among the dung they had excreted. The men, who drank all the time, would brawl with each other at a moment’s notice. Often wounding or killing each other, none of the Viking villagers found bloodshed to be reprehensible. The Viking warriors were amazingly unaffected by blood and gore that often made Ibn empty the contents of his stomach. Fadian once remarked that the town crier greatly impressed him due to the fact that as he yelled out the news of the recent days, he was hit in the face by the blood from a deadly fight, yet he remained composed and without so much as a reaction as he continued his oration!\\n\\nMany times during the course of the story, Ibn Fadian calls upon the name of Allah as he is truly miffed over the strange behavior of the barbarian Norsemen, who fear no one, not even each other. Even during their frequent carnal encounters with Viking women they are often injured by the violent act of attempting to copulate with the women who are kicking, biting, and clawing the men in the midst of the unceremonious sex occurring without privacy or tenderness. Ibn admitted himself that the act itself with these Viking women amounted to more pain than any pleasure that could come of it. Ibn says in his manuscript that he even wretched at the smell of the Vikings because of their vile personal hygiene!\\n\\nThe Viking warriors often feasted and drank to the point of unconsciousness on a regular basis. Yet, in the midst of this personal excess, the Vikings managed incredible crafts in wood carving, making the finest weapons, and adorning their swords with intricate metal forged designs! Ibn Fadian clearly marvels at the bizarre contradictions in the Viking culture.\\n\\nAn Arab witnesses a Viking funeral\\n\\nWhen Ibn Fadian first entered the Viking village Wyglif, the village’s leading warrior is deathly sick. Among the brutish beliefs of their culture is the idea that anyone afflicted with a life threatening sickness must be kept away from everyone else, allowed to heal based upon their own strength, and be left only with water and bread as assistance. Wyglif died shortly after Ibn Fadian’s arrival. He next testified to the barbarian ceremonies that followed once the former lead warrior of the village had died.\\n\\nUpon the death of all honored warriors an incredible ritual was played out among the village Norsemen. The body of the deceased was placed at rest while a ship was constructed that would float out to sea. Animals were slaughtered, gold and silver rendered, food and drink was brought to accompany the warrior to the afterlife. Then a woman in the village would declare under her own willingness that she would die with the great warrior who was to be honored. This ensured her own demise, but this was considered to be an honor.\\n\\nOnce a huge feast was undertaken in honor of the dead Viking which also induced much drunkenness, the woman who had proclaimed she would die with the deceased one being honored would take on several sexual partners as part of the ceremony. Once the dead Viking was placed on a throne with all his worldly possessions, the woman was placed next to him then pierced through the ribs or strangled with a rope as that she would now accompany the corpse of the celebrated Viking on the final voyage to the after-life. In the finished boat strewn with sacrifices of food, animals, gold, jewelry, and silver, the ship was set adrift toward the sea. As the vessel began drifting away at a distance flaming arrows ignited the funeral ship. It burned brightly and sunk in relatively shallow waters, but was left alone and abandoned by the attendants of the barbaric sacrificial funeral.\\n\\nIbn marveled at the spectacle of fervent effort on the part of the Vikings to ensure that their comrade would be properly delivered unto the after-life which the Vikings called Valhalla, the equivalent of heaven.\\n\\nA call for help\\n\\nAfter this significant event, days later bad news came to the village. Once Buliwyf received the news the Vikings became silent with a dread that Ibn Fadian had never observed upon them before. Even Herger, Ibn’s translator refused to give a literal interpretation of what the nature of the threat was only that it was the worst danger that Vikings could endure or fight. Once this threat had been registered the Vikings made sudden planes to leave with the leader, Buliwyf saying that would he save the kingdom of Rothgar. Here it was said that the threat manifested itself.\\n\\nA rescue party is organized\\n\\nThirteen of the best warriors in the village were chosen to go and save the kingdom of Rothgar, this included Herger, Buliwyf, and Fadian. Even though Ibn had been a quasi-captive to the Vikings in the beginning, now he was elected to assist in the vanquishing of an, as yet, undetermined threat as far as Ibn Fadian was concerned. Herger told him that he would find out soon enough. It is interesting to note that Viking women according to Ibn seemed boney and thin no matter how much they ate and drank alongside the men, yet they were prized by their men for having ribs that showed and high cheekbones. To Ibn, these Viking women who often giggled amongst themselves over him calling him a dark steed seemed emaciated compared to the Arab women he was accustomed to.\\n\\nAfter setting out on a long trek that brought the Viking party through frozen shorelines, icy old cold rains, sleeping out in the open under frigid conditions which seemed to have no effect upon the Norsemen, still they pushed on. Ibn could barely keep up with his Viking counterparts who could walk great distances through the heavy snows in dense, forbidden, forests. At times he thought he would collapse from exhaustion and exposure. Ibn remembered how the brutal Vikings were very hospitable to their slaves which were usually women they sold and used for sex, yet the Norsemen pushed themselves unmercifully in the midst of their long sojourn to the Kingdom of Rothgar.\\n\\nVikings superior mariners\\n\\nIbn Fadian was very impressed by the Viking ships that he said handled the waters better than any vessel he had ever traveled in. He marveled at the stability, speed, and smooth ride of the Viking ships not to mention the skill of the crew. Even today, archeologists and engineers have come to respect the craftsmanship of the Viking ships that when reproduced to the original specifications of ancient design rival the most advanced designs of today! Fadian considered himself privileged to have ridden the waters among his Viking crew as they navigated the Volga River on their way to Rothgar. Soon they would arrive at their destination.\\n\\nArrival at Rothgar\\n\\nIbn Fadian observed that Rothgar was an impressive settlement with a gigantic wooden arched royal court with massive carved doors. The Vikings gazed upon the kingdom in awe and reverence, yet they did not respect the king. They considered him a hypocrite for building a mighty castle, but not having his own kingdom under control. His lands were being ravaged by the much feared scourge that the King, his noblemen, and subjects were living in dread of. One crewman remained in the Viking ship as the rest of the party were received by the King’s guards who actually challenged the crew disbelievingly until Buliwyf convinced them that they were there to save the kingdom.\\n\\nThe work of fiends\\n\\nIbn finally found out who and what it was that they would be up against as they approached the grounds of the kingdom there was a farm house they entered outside the walls of Rothgar. There, they found what had been a pleasant home and quaint farm that had been ravaged by this unspeakable menace. The family had been torn limb from limb literally. The Viking warriors showed no terror over the murders but calmly investigated the massacre site while Ibn wretched at the blood and horrible nature of the atrocities committed. The bodies had been chewed and gnarled as if by animals. Yet, the Vikings knew exactly who had committed the deed based upon the manner in which the family had been horrifically slaughtered.\\n\\nWho were they?\\n\\nFinally Ibn Fadian found out from Herger, the Viking translator, just who or what was responsible. The Vikings called them the Wendol. Monsters were what the Vikings considered them to be. These monstrous invaders had nearly taken over the Kingdom as the King was powerless to defend his subjects. The people of Rothgar merely existed like sheep in the presence of wolves who could take as many as they wanted whenever they wanted. To the disgust of Buliwyf, Herger, and the Viking warriors, this was unacceptable and cowardly. This was why they held the king in such low regard though they outwardly showed him respect according to Ibn.\\n\\nThe people were glad to see the Viking party and welcomed them, yet they privately doubted that the mighty warrior party could stop the monsters that raided their kingdom with impunity. The first night after they arrived, a feast was held. Ibn was apprehensive as he watched the Vikings eat roasted beef, lamb, and chicken. They drank mead, which Ibn denounced as the most vile liquor he had ever tasted. It was a spirit made from fermented honey. Yet, Ibn would grow to enjoy mead as time went on even to take it before going into battle and recuperating from wounds afterword.\\n\\nFeast before death defying battle?\\n\\nIbn wondered why the Vikings would simply gorge themselves on a feast and drink themselves into intoxication when they were about to encounter these bloodthirsty monsters that terrorized the kingdom. There were things about them that he never could fully understand. His written observations are extraordinary as we come to understand the nature of these Norsemen who raided the coastal ports of Great Britain and plundered deep into Europe all the way through Germany and into what is now the lands of the Russian Federation. In all this, the Norsemen made artfully adorned swords, knives, shields, arrows, their trademark battle axes, iron works, and exquisite ship design, yet unleashed their savage fury upon European citizens during their raids. From accounts given by Fadian, we now know why the Viking was considered to be so invincible and legendary for his skill as a warrior as well as his fearless nature.\\n\\nSea monsters and land monsters too?\\n\\nIn all this there appeared to be only two things the Vikings feared with great apprehension, this Ibn Fadian attested to, the Wendol and sea serpents. The sea serpents, Ibn Fadian had been very skeptical about as he watched the Norsemen sailors point out into the seas and claim to catch a glimpse of until he saw them too. Ibn described the sea serpents as having huge snake-like bodies and showing themselves as humps in the waters. Ibn too greatly feared what he saw. One might wonder if what Ibn Fadian and the Vikings were seeing was not giant squid or whale. Yet, the Vikings did make a distinction between whales and other sea creatures.\\n\\nIn Part III we shall finally see who and what the Wendol were and then speculate over their true anthropological origin. Often times, eye witness accounts clash with the assumptions of modern science. These Wendol were the “Eaters of the Dead”.\\n\\nClick here for Part III',\n",

       " 'While the community continues to piece together the confusing, disheartening mess surrounding 3rd Ward’s closure (Hyperallergic has a pretty comprehensive look at what actually happened), local artists and organizations—many of whom are still owed money by the shuttered organization—have done an impressive job of coming together, with institutions like Brooklyn Brainery, Course Horse, and even Manhattan’s National Academy School stepping up to offer classes and services to displaced former members. Local writer and teacher Robin Grearson is now doing one better, having wrangled more than twenty small businesses, as well as teachers and artists, for “What’s Next? Creating Community,” designed as a post-3rd Ward means of bringing Brooklyn’s creative community together.\\n\\n“The collapse was so sudden and final that it didn’t allow anyone to come up with solutions as a community,” says Grearson, a former freelance instructor at 3rd Ward (“I’m not one of the people they owe money to,” she notes). “The people I met through 3rd Ward are all really creative, talented people. If anyone can build something from nothing on a moment’s notice, it’s this group. I just wanted them to find a place to be able to start talking to each other. ”\\n\\nThe event quickly found a home at Brooklyn Brewery (which donated its tasting room and use of its staff for the night), and will essentially serve as a means of connecting 3rd Ward’s former denizens with like-minded local institutions like Brooklyn Fire Proof, Mellow Pages, Silent Barn, and Union Docs. “Former instructors will be talking about new projects and plans, small businesses will be introduced who serve tech, fashion, and culinary communities,” Grearson says. “Speakers will talk about free stuff they’re offering displaced students, and classrooms will be connecting with instructors–all free, all for individuals to find their own ways to build/make/design/learn.”\\n\\nAll of which sounds like a pretty solid way to spend a night, even if it’s coming as the result of a dubiously run business leaving trusting local artists in the lurch. Grearson also notes, “People feel the loss of 3rd Ward because it attracted so many talented, smart, and creative people. But the people were its strength, and they’re still here. I want to see value return to the creative community instead of a group investors.” Doesn’t seem like a bad idea to us.\\n\\nFollow Virginia K. Smith on Twitter @vksmith.',\n",
       " 'The Trump administration said Friday it would go to the Supreme Court to fight a Hawaii federal judge’s decision vastly expanding the number of people exempt from the government’s ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries and all refugees.\\n\\nU.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson ruled Thursday that the government had failed to follow Supreme Court orders last month that established conditions for a partial revival of the ban, whose implementation had been blocked by the courts.\\n\\nThe decision does not halt the travel ban, which was reinstated by the Supreme Court on June 29 with exemptions for a limited list people with “bona fide” U.S. connections, such as close family members. But going against Trump administration policy, the ruling expands the exceptions to include travelers who have grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers- and sisters-in-law in the U.S.\\n\\nThe judge also said that contrary to government policy, refugees cannot be blocked if they have “formal assurance” from U.S. resettlement agencies for relocation to the country — even if the refugees do not have relatives in the U.S.\\n\\nThe administration’s implementation of the ban’s limits represented “the antithesis of common sense,” the judge said.\\n\\nIn a statement Friday, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions accused Watson of trying to “micromanage” the president’s authority over ensuring national security.\\n\\n“By this decision, the district court has improperly substituted its policy preferences for the national security judgments of the executive branch in a time of grave threats, defying both the lawful prerogatives of the executive branch and the directive of the Supreme Court,” Sessions said.\\n\\nIn the meantime, unless a higher court intervenes, Watson’s decision means that potentially thousands of refugees who had been vetted for U.S. admission but were blocked after the government cut off most refugee admissions on Wednesday — the day the country hit a cap of 50,000 refugee admissions for the fiscal year — may now be let in.\\n\\n“We are reviewing the decision and will be in consultation with DOJ to ensure immediate implementation,” the Department of State said in a statement Friday.\\n\\nThe Department of Justice also said in a court filing Friday that it was challenging Watson’s order in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\\n\\nRefugee resettlement groups and immigrant advocates on Friday celebrated Watson’s decision.\\n\\nThe order “represents relief for over 24,000 refugees who had already been vetted and approved by the U.S. and assigned to resettlement agencies. Many of them had already sold all of their belongings to start their new lives in safety,” Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in a statement. The group is among those suing the administration over the ban.\\n\\n“This decision gives back hope to so many who would otherwise be stranded indefinitely,” Heller said. “Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for our refugee clients, who are still affected by the government’s attempts to freeze refugee resettlement.”\\n\\nFor two weeks, the Trump administration and the state of Hawaii have fought repeatedly in federal courts over whom the ban can block.\\n\\nAt issue is how to determine which travelers have “close” relatives living in the U.S. or are associated with the country in other ways that let them bypass the ban — standards set by the Supreme Court when it lifted the previous halt on enforcement of the ban.\\n\\nPresident Trump’s executive order halts travel by nationals of Somalia, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Iran but allows exceptions for those with what the Supreme Court called “bona fide” connections with the U.S. The government has said those connections include a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, fiance or fiancee, and in-law parents.\\n\\nBut the administration said grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers- and sisters-in-law are not close enough to qualify for admission during the duration of the order. Attorneys for the state of Hawaii successfully petitioned Watson to order the government to count all of those categories as “bona fide” U.S. connections.\\n\\nIn the case of refugees, state lawyers argued that a refugee resettlement organization’s interactions with a refugee constitute a bona fide relationship. The administration disagreed.\\n\\nHawaii\\'s win came after it was twice rejected in court attempts to weaken the ban.\\n\\nOn July 6, Watson denied a request from the state to \"clarify\" exceptions to the ban, saying that he did not have the authority to interpret Supreme Court orders. The next day, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a similar request from the state, saying it did not have jurisdiction over the matter.\\n\\nBut appellate judges told challengers that they could try a different legal maneuver in the district court. Judges said Hawaii attorneys could request Watson to issue an injunction against the ban\\'s implementation or modify an injunction he had issued that previously had halted the ban before his order was partially lifted by the Supreme Court. Hawaii filed both requests last week.\\n\\nThe travel ban calls for a three-month pause on travel to the U.S. by nationals of the six Muslim-majority countries and a four-month halt on all refugee resettlement.\\n\\nWatson was one of the judges who granted a restraining order blocking implementation. His order was issued in a case filed in March by the state of Hawaii.\\n\\nSuccessful challenges in that case and another filed in a Maryland federal court were upheld in the 9th Circuit and 4th Circuit appellate courts before requests were made to the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the ban.\\n\\nOn June 26, the Supreme Court said the ban could be put back into place with exceptions, but left it up to the government to define most of them. The court indicated its move was a temporary measure until justices hear full arguments on Trump’s executive order in the fall.\\n\\njaweed.kaleem@latimes.com\\n\\nJaweed Kaleem is The Times\\' national race and justice correspondent.

Their inspiration for Chinatown Pretty? Man Ta, \"the woman with the jade shoes,\" who Valerie first spotted getting off a bus somewhere between Chinatown and North Beach. She just knew she had to find out the story behind the chic octogenarian and her bright green kicks.As it turns out, the sneakers are from a store on Stockton Street, and she owns ten pairs: \"I wear them until they break,\" Man Ta told Valerie and Andria. A longtime Chinatown resident, she has since seen that store on Stockton shutter.Andria says, \"We love the unexpected styles we see in Chinatown. Outfits are often effortless and gutsy at the same time, they look really fresh!\"To find their street-style subjects, Andria and Valerie meet in Portsmouth Square in San Francisco Chinatown. \"There you\\'ll find seniors playing cards and chess out of makeshift tables made out of cardboard and milk crates,\" says Valerie. \"We walk around Chinatown, circling blocks for hours in hopes in running into someone whose outfit makes our hearts skip a beat.\"Sometimes the Chinatown seniors they encounter are reluctant to be interviewed and have their photos snapped; Andria and Valerie call them \"unicorns: rare, magical, and elusive.\" One such woman, prone to mixing plaid and houndstooth patterns, had always waved them off when they previously approached, until the day the two sat down next to her on a bench and waited patiently for her to feel comfortable enough to open up about her story—she was an immigrant from Hong Kong, and her white painter\\'s cap, worn cocked to the side for sun protection, belonged to her late husband.Earlier this year, Andria and Valerie made a trip down to southern California to visit Los Angeles Chinatown. They met the Wongs near the Alpine Rec Center, where Mrs. Wong teaches Luk Tung Kuen, a stretching exercise that originated in Hong Kong. The Wongs wore a matching set of canary yellow tracksuits—Mr. Wong, who suffered a stroke a few years ago, accessorized with a navy blue \"staff\" baseball cap. The Wongs were introduced by a cousin and have been married for 69 years, Andria and Valerie discovered.Timeless fashion is a common thread among the stylish seniors whose portraits and stories that Andria and Valerie have captured; the Wongs, for example, have happily worn these sunny tracksuits for decades.\"We find out the style choices are often rooted in function and cultural values,\" says Andria. \"We learn about their personal histories through their clothing.\"Valerie says, \"I\\'ve been surprised by how fiercely independent the seniors are. Many elderly people live on their own in single room occupancy apartments (SROS) with shared bathrooms and kitchens. They tell us that they prefer to live on their own; to be in an urban setting where they can easily walk or take the bus to grocery stores and doctors appointments and be in the company of friends.\"The beautiful portraits and accompanying stories featured on Chinatown Pretty lovingly honor a population that\\'s perhaps too often overlooked.

       " 'OTTAWA—While some Canadians unwrapped new video game systems over the holidays, the Canadian Armed Forces looked to develop their own. The Forces are planning to buy a motion-capture suit that would “dramatically upgrade” their virtual reality training programs.\\n\\nA woman wearing 3D glasses tests a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) virtual reality theatre during its presentation at the Industrial Centre for Virtual Reality in Saint-Nazaire, France in December. ( GEORGES GOBET / AFP/GETTY IMAGES ) Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs is photographed in a spandex suit prior to a motion capture session at the Electronic Arts studios in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. The video game industry is outspending the Canadian Armed Forces in virtual reality spending. ( Jeff Vinnick / Electronic Arts/GETTY IMAGES file photo )\\n\\nThey plan to use the suit, complete with 19 separate sensors, to make their virtual training more realistic, modelling complex and detailed environments in what’s called a Corner Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (Corner CAVE) system. “The Corner CAVE is a cutting-edge system designed to create virtual 3D reproductions of anything that can be modelled in 3D, such as mechanical sub-components of an engine, a complex weapon system, or a piece of terrain,” according to an advertisement for the new suit. “The incorporation of this upgraded capability would greatly increase the scope of projects that could be encompassed under the Corner CAVE system.”\\n\\nArticle Continued Below\\n\\nThe system projects the virtual environment onto two or three walls to provide an encompassing environment for training. In the military context, the Corner CAVE can be used for everything from small arms training to realistic lessons on repairing equipment in the field, from interacting with local populations to treating soldiers dealing with post-traumatic stress. It’s not clear how much the motion-capture suit will cost. Estimates from lower-end suits are in the hundreds of dollars, with higher-end equipment costing significantly more. The Forces have requested bids from suppliers by Jan. 12. The Forces says it needs the suit to further develop its Corner CAVE training programs.\\n\\nThe current motion-capture system at CFB Gagetown in Oromocto, N.B., can capture movements only in an eight-foot by eight-foot area. Because it’s a camera-based system, it is difficult to accurately map interactions with equipment. Props used in the system also block the camera’s line of sight between the cameras and the motion-capture sensors. The system also requires six hours to set up and calibrate.\\n\\nArticle Continued Below\\n\\nThe Forces are increasingly turning to virtual reality, including video games, to help train their personnel for real-life missions. The Canadian Press reported in December 2003 that some in the Forces were skeptical of the turn to the virtual, calling it a cost-cutting tool that can’t replace physical drills. But Maj. Sam Pollock said the virtual training is not meant to replace those drills, but to augment them and speed soldiers’ training. “In my opinion, (with) current technologies . . . there’s always going to be a compromise with simulations. You’re never going to be able to perfectly replicate the real, actual, live sort of field environment,” said Pollock in an interview earlier this month. “But, on the other hand, you can optimize that time you spend in the field by using simulations in advance, going through your basic weapons handling drills without actually being in a live-fire (environment). Where you’ve got a very low-stress environment, and you can actually then go on to the live-firing portion and be much more effective.” Another advantage, Pollock says, is that by simulating repairs on an engine or the handling of complex weapon systems, the actual engines and weapon systems can be deployed in the field if need be. The development of virtual training took off within the Forces around 2007, according to Pollock, when the army realized they needed to quickly address a “shortfall in certain training capacities” in the military. The army now has more than 230 simulators in 125 locations, with seven primary sites. It’s not only the military looking to advance this type of technology, however. Pollock said the video game industry is actually outspending the Canadian Armed Forces on these technologies. Something to think about next time you’re playing Call of Duty.',\n",

They go on about freedom, but for goodness sake where was Jane’s freedom?\\n\\n‘The police should make it routine that if somebody is accused of murder or a serious attack they should investigate if this stuff is on their computer.’\\n\\nTabak was found guilty of murder on Friday although the jury was not told that he had trawled an internet site boasting 58,000 videos and 50 categories of pornography hours before strangling Jo.\\n\\nThe murderer viewed images of women being held by the neck saying ‘choke me’ and two naked women bound and gagged in the boot of a car.\\n\\nThe case has rekindled fears that the authorities and internet companies are failing to do enough to protect society from extreme pornography. One web watchdog admitted that orders aimed at forcing internet companies to remove material have been issued just 49 times in the past three years.\\n\\nThe Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said this was despite thousands of complaints from computer users, including 2,700 in the last year alone.\\n\\nIWF chief executive Susie Hargreaves admitted the watchdog has been largely powerless to act against the tide of extreme pornography.\\n\\nShe said: ‘The IWF is able to act on any public reports of online obscene adult content where it is hosted in the UK and contravenes UK Law.\\n\\n‘However, we receive very few reports of this type of content which satisfies these criteria.’\\n\\nThe vast majority of obscene material reported to the IWF is hosted overseas or is assessed as unlikely to result in a prosecution.\\n\\nLast year more than 2,700 reports were made by the public but just a dozen were judged as potentially criminal and eight notices issued.\\n\\nExperts warn that the overwhelming amount of violent imagery on the internet can desensitise some men to believe that the abuse of woman is normal.\\n\\nAnd there is little to stop children accessing and exchanging shocking images and videos on mobile phones and through social networking sites.\\n\\nRecent figures revealed that more than a tenth of children under ten have accessed inappropriate adult material online.\\n\\nCampaigner: MP Martin Salter helped introduce the new laws, but now says they need to be tightened\\n\\nThe Church of England’s stance on porn was welcomed by the Rev Richard Moy, who works with young people in Lichfield, Staffordshire.\\n\\nHe said: ‘It is not surprising that people go from soft porn to progressively more hard-core porn to the point where they are so depraved that they do things that they would never imagine doing.\\n\\n‘I think that if people start using mild porn to gratify a need rather than looking at why they need that gratification then they will eventually move on to more disturbing things.’\\n\\nFormer Labour MP Martin Salter, who campaigned for the new laws, said he wants to see police using them and sending out a clear message.\\n\\n‘There are some people so evil and so depraved that nothing will deter them. But it was hoped that by tightening these laws we might prevent some unbalanced individuals from being tipped over the edge.\\n\\n‘Quite frankly, every time the police use these powers and there is more publicity about their existence, the greater the deterrent factor in these cases.’\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Megyn Kelly (Photo: ~File photo)\\n\\n“Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick, & the most overrated person on tv.” —Donald Trump\\n\\nFox News is shocked, utterly shocked, that its favorite billionaire is fixated on one of its anchors and calling for a boycott of her show.\\n\\n“Donald Trump’s vitriolic attacks against Megyn Kelly and his extreme, sick obsession with her is beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate,” the network huffed. “As the mother of three young children … it’s especially deplorable for her to be repeatedly abused just for doing her job.”\\n\\nSomeone’s got to say it: Sick right wing obsessions were just fine with Fox until Trump became consumed with his grudge against Kelly and told his nearly 7.3 million Twitter followers to boycott The Kelly File.\\n\\nFor at least the past five years, both Trump and Fox News have had a vitriolic and sick obsession with the idea that President Obama was born in Kenya, and therefore isn’t a natural born U.S. citizen and is ineligible for the presidency (aka the “birther” conspiracy). During the 2012 presidential campaign, Fox went full birther. In just a few weeks in spring 2011, for instance, the network devoted more than 50 segments and more than two hours of air time to the subject. Trump frequently received a free platform to promote himself and his outrageous, unsupported speculations about the location of Obama’s birthplace.\\n\\nThese segments were all over the Fox network, featuring Fox hosts such as Sean Hannity, Steve Doocy, Jeanine Pirro, Brian Kilmeade, Greta Van Susteren, and others.\\n\\nThere is as much evidence for Obama being born in Kenya as for Trump being born in Mexico City and smuggled secretly into the United States. That is to say, none. The talk was as worthless as a Trump University diploma. Trump’s obsession with “birtherism” was valuable, however, for Fox’s ratings and profits — and Fox obviously didn’t care that it was bad for the country.\\n\\nTrump is also obsessed with the delusion that Mexico is sending us its rapists and criminals (spoiler alert: Trump has no evidence this is happening). Fox supported Trump’s fixation on Mexican immigrants, and again gave him a platform. After all, blaming immigrants for crime was good for Fox’s ratings and profits.\\n\\nYet another of Trump’s sick fixations is with Muslim-Americans. He claims they cheered for the 9/11 attacks, but they didn’t. Trump further demands that Muslims be banned from entering the United States and that those Muslims already here register with the federal government. Again, Fox gave Trump a platform for his unsupported and inflammatory views. It was good for Fox’s ratings and profits to scapegoat a minority group.\\n\\nFox has also been chief enabler for other right-wing obsessions, such as the vitriolic and sick attacks on law student Sandra Fluke, who dared to champion a view on reproductive rights that didn’t fit the right wing political agenda. At various times on Fox, Fluke was called stupid, a slut and worse. Even Kelly joined in the attacks, saying Fluke “doesn’t know what she’s talking about.” The public shaming was a warning to others who spoke up instead of bowing down to the Fox political propaganda machine.\\n\\nIn the face of Trump’s assault on Kelly, Fox’s concern for her children is laudable. But what about Obama’s two children? Did anyone at Fox ask how they must have felt, to continually hear broadcasts hinting that their father wasn’t really an American? And Fox clearly hasn’t been concerned about the children of Mexican-Americans or Muslim-Americans.\\n\\nFox was perfectly happy all these years to give Trump and others a platform to rant about their weird and unfounded obsessions, which often involved the trashing of innocent Americans. None of this (according to Fox) was unbecoming for a presidential candidate. Trump’s criticism of Fox, however, is unacceptable. Really, Fox? After all the hateful innuendo you’ve broadcast, including character attacks on all sorts of Americans, can you truly expect us to sympathize because Trump had the audacity to train his fire on you?\\n\\nI don’t know whether we should laugh at Fox for its sudden self-righteousness, or cry for the state of our republic.\\n\\nI feel for Megyn Kelly, but Fox News — you are the schoolyard bully of the American media landscape. And like all other puffed-up bullies, you can dish it out, but you just can’t take it.\\n\\nSteven Strauss is the John L. Weinberg/Goldman Sachs & Co.

       " 'Apple is reportedly in an ongoing discussion for revising its deals with music labels. The company is said to be looking to bag a discount on the streaming revenue cut charged by labels, now that Apple Music and iTunes both bring enough traction for music companies. Apple is reportedly looking to cut the profit revenue percentage of record labels from streaming, as their deals now expire by the end of June, and new deals need to be signed.\\n\\nBloomberg reports that Apple looks to bring its rate down to what competitor Spotify pays to its labels. In the initial days of Apple Music, the company reportedly overpaid record labels to get them on board. The music industry was vary that Apple Music would cannibalise their iTunes business – which was a major source of revenue. However, now that Apple Music has been live for two years, and hasn’t been as harmful to iTunes as expected, record labels are now warming up to the idea, albeit with reservations, the report adds.\\n\\nThe report also claims that record labels are still asking Apple to push iTunes in countries where streaming isn’t such a big deal. In countries like Japan and Germany, music is still bought and heard, rather than streamed. In developing and emerging countries, people still prefer to download than stream music.\\n\\nIn the current deal, Apple gave 58 percent of revenue generated from Apple Music subscribers to record labels, while Spotify has now reduced that margin to just 52 percent. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report states, “The labels are open to a reduction in Apple’s rate -- provided it’s also able to expand subscriber rolls and meet other requirements.”\\n\\nSpotify was able to bargain as it promised a growth in subscribers, and Apple may be using similar tactics to get music labels on board with the negotiations, the report adds.',\n",
       " 'Share\\n\\nThe so-called SensiVest is the creation of Israel company Sensible Medical. Using the same tech the military use for seeing through walls, it looks straight through the chest and into the lungs. It’s meant to be worn by the patient for 90 minutes each day and is designed for outpatient use — meaning that it can be used in their home, rather than the hospital. Wexner Medical Center is currently carrying out a randomized, clinical trial to test the SensiVest’s efficacy.\\n\\nSo far, things are looking good.\\n\\n“The vest is based on radar technology,” Dr. Rami Kahwash, a principal researcher involved in the study, told Digital Trends. “It uses sensors that emit electromagnetic waves which let it calculate the fluid content of the wearer’s lungs. That number is then transmitted to a secure website, where it can be accessed by physicians. If the patient is recording these numbers daily, then by the end of the week or month we’ll have a set of numbers that give us a good idea of the amount of fluid in their lungs.”\\n\\nThe SensiVest clinical trial is still underway, but a previous investigation suggested that use of the SensiVest can mean 87 percent fewer hospital readmissions.\\n\\nThat is not just about giving physicians an easier day, though. According to Kahwash, by the time patients present in the hospital, it can be too late to act. Studies have shown that the buildup of fluid in the lungs can actually start two weeks before patients seek help, which opens up a potentially lifesaving use for this technology.\\n\\n“The hope is that if we can track this trend of fluid in the lungs, we can intervene early on as soon as we see that the numbers are going up,” Kahwash said.\\n\\nAt present, patients do not see the numbers that the device gathers. That could change in the future, though. Kahwash hypothesized that, should the numbers be made available to the patient, doctors could also provide them with a manual algorithm — letting them adjust their medication dosage according to the numbers gathered by the SensiVest.\\n\\n“Perhaps that way we may eliminate the physician out of the cycle, which could result in more prompt interventions on a day-by-day basis,” Kahwash said.',\n",
       " 'Hillary Transue couldn’t imagine that anyone could take serious offense. In July 2006 she had created a MySpace page that mocked the vice principal of her high school in Mountain Top, Pa., by suggesting the woman daydreamed “about Johnny Depp in nothing but tighty whites.” The first shock for Transue, then 14, was that the vice principal notified the police and pressed harassment charges. But that was nothing compared to her disbelief when she appeared before juvenile judge Mark Ciavarella Jr. in April 2007. Expecting no more than a slap on the wrist, she and her mother, Laurene, hadn’t even hired a lawyer. Instead she got a harsh lecture from Ciavarella, who ended by announcing “adjudicated delinquent!” and banging down his gavel. Hillary was taken away in handcuffs, sentenced to three months in a boot camp. “The whole thing lasted about 30 seconds,” she says. “It was so surreal.”\\n\\nBut all too common in Luzerne County, as it turned out. Stunned by what had happened to her daughter, Laurene Transue began asking questions about the workings of Ciavarella’s court. She ultimately enlisted the assistance of the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia, which helped the FBI uncover an astonishing scandal: Ciavarella and another judge, Michael Conahan, pleaded guilty on Feb. 12 to $2.6 million in fraud and tax evasion in a kickback scheme that federal prosecutors say involved sending thousands of juveniles to two private detention facilities—even if it meant railroading teens for the smallest infractions. (Ciavarella and Conahan have denied that they were paid cash for kids.) On March 26 a Pennsylvania judge announced that the records of hundreds of kids sent away would be expunged, with the prospect that even more would be cleared in the months ahead. “It’s impossible to describe the level of outrage you feel,” says Marsha Levick, deputy director of the Juvenile Law Center. “There is nothing else in the history of the legal system like it.”\\n\\nCertainly Transue had never experienced anything like what she found at Camp Adams. (Prosecutors have not accused Camp Adams of being part of the kickback scheme.) On arrival she was given a pair of sweatpants, a T-shirt and used underwear. “It was raining, and it looked like a desolate campground in the middle of nowhere,” she says. “The first night was pretty horrible. I cried a lot.” She was allowed to speak to her family for only eight minutes a week. Laurene contacted the Juvenile Law Center, which furnished an attorney who got Hillary another hearing before Ciavarella. After a month Hillary was set free. But officials at the Law Center, appalled by Ciavarella’s treatment of Hillary, pressed their inquiry about why the judge seemed to have turned a key legal principle—which is to use incarceration of juveniles only as a last resort—on its head.\\n\\nThe investigators came across numerous cases of what appeared to be grotesquely severe punishment handed out by Ciavarella. One of them involved Charlie Balasavage of Wilkes-Barre, whose ordeal began in the summer of 2006 when he was 15 and his parents bought him a used motor bike from a cousin. A few weeks later, the police showed up at the house to inform Charlie that the bike had been stolen. The family explained they had no idea, but that didn’t matter—all three of them were arrested.\\n\\nThe charges against Charlie’s parents, Charlie Sr. and Joanne, were quickly dropped. But in January 2007 Charlie was summoned to appear before Ciavarella. Outside the courtroom parents and their children waited to be called in. The Balasavages soon realized that they were in for trouble. How? “That day I did not see one parent come out with a kid,” says Charlie, “and there were a lot of kids.” Sure enough, when it was Charlie’s turn, Ciavarella threw the book at him, sentencing him to six months at Camp Adams and having him led away in shackles. (Adults convicted of receiving stolen merchandise usually get probation.) Since then Charlie has been to more than half a dozen youth offender camps, two of which have been implicated in the kickback scheme. “You feel you’re in this wind tunnel,” says an angry Joanne, “a whirlpool, and you can’t get out.”\\n\\nParents felt powerless to stand up to the judges. “Ciavarella sold kids like they were cattle—black, white, it didn’t matter what color they were,” says Fredrick Johnson, whose son DayQuawn, 16, was thrown in a juvenile facility for three days in 2006. His crime? He had been given a subpoena to testify against a classmate who allegedly had a knife. DayQuawn, who was 13 and suffers from a learning disability, never told his parents and never showed up for the hearing, which led to his being hauled away from his school in handcuffs.\\n\\nAttorneys for the Juvenile Law Center discovered that kids who appeared before Ciavarella were sent to detention facilities 26 percent of the time, while the state average is between 8 and 10 percent. What’s more, a large number of kids were evidently encouraged to waive their right to have an attorney present. Prosecutors say Conahan even made sure authorities shut down a county facility for juveniles that would have competed with the private ones. There were rumbles about irregularities in Ciavarella’s courtroom, but for years nothing came of them. “In that courtroom you were presumed guilty,” says attorney Barry Dyller, who had clients before Ciavarella. “But whatever anyone’s suspicions, no one had actual evidence of wrongdoing.”\\n\\nUltimately another county judge, Ann Lokuta, took her concerns to the FBI, which contacted the Juvenile Law Center to learn what they knew. The feds then nailed Ciavarella and Conahan, who had used their loot to purchase, among other things, a $785,000 Florida condo. Since then the scandal has grown beyond the two judges, both of whom have agreed to sentences of more than seven years. Two other court underlings have pleaded guilty to corruption charges. Officials are still going through the records of as many as 2,500 kids who could have been wrongly incarcerated. To those who suffered at the hands of the judges, that is all well and good, but it hardly helps them get back a precious part of their childhood. “I don’t care if he goes away for seven hours or seven years,” Hillary Transue says of Ciavarella. “At least he can never do this kind of thing to children again.”',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Bruce Levine–\\n\\nCHICAGO (CBS) — The center field position is manned by potential All-Star players on both the north and south sides of Chicago. With Jason Heyward signed for eight years with the Cubs and Adam Eaton under White Sox control for six more years (the team holds club options in 2021 and 2021), it would appear neither team has to worry about center field in the near future.\\n\\nOn the other hand, both clubs would be stronger on defense with these two quality players in right field. Heyward is a three-time Gold Glove winner in right field. Eaton had a difficult 2015 season on defense after showing much better skills the previous year. Before the club dealt away Trayce Thompson to the Dodgers in a deal to acquire third baseman Todd Frazier, White Sox manager Robin Ventura said in early December that the competition for the center field spot would be open this spring.\\n\\nWith that as context, we now turn our attention back to Dexter Fowler, a free agent who has yet to find a new home after submitting a quality season for the Cubs in 2015. Fowler had a (full-season) career-low .346 on-base percentage, but that’s still a good number in comparison to the league average mark of .317. Fowler was tied for 51st in on-base percentage in all of baseball. Playing in a career-high 152 games, he also was fourth in the National League with 104 runs scored and had a career-high 20 stolen bases.\\n\\nFowler declined the Cubs’ one-year qualifying offer of $15.8 million and has since watched the market for outfielders — and center fielders, more specifically — grind on at a really slow pace. So, if this slow free-agent market continues, is either Chicago team an option for the 30-year-old Fowler on a short-term basis?\\n\\nThe Cubs would have to make a decision on moving an outfielder before bringing Fowler back as an everyday player. The assumption would be that 23-year-old Jorge Soler could be moved in return for pitching, in either the rotation or bullpen, before bringing on Fowler would be considered.\\n\\nFor the White Sox, the switch-hitting Fowler would give them some speed at the top of the order, a respectable on-base percentage ahead of their sluggers and left-handed pop in their home run-friendly ballpark. Of Fowler’s 17 homers last season, 13 came from the left side.\\n\\nFowler was a mixed bag defensively in 2015. Not known for great range in the past, his path to the ball improved in 2015. The Wrigley Field bricks also weren’t inviting to an impending free agent like Fowler, who played better defense in road contests.\\n\\nFowler’s work ethic was intense last season. Both he and teammate Anthony Rizzo had head-spinning strength training workout regiments before every game. The reps alone would have worn out some Olympic hurdlers.\\n\\nThe Cubs coaching staff implored Fowler to lead with energy and plate discipline. He responded by drawing a career-high 84 walks, while also striking out 154 times. Cubs manager Joe Maddon and bench coach/outfield coach Davey Martinez were extremely influential in Fowler’s successful season.\\n\\nFowler has been trapped in the free-agent outfielder mix this offseason. On Thursday, Denard Span signed a three-year $31-million contract with the Giants. This may or may not be good news for Fowler, who made $9.5 million in 2015. Getting more money on average annually after the Span signing may be difficult, but several teams still would like to sign a center fielder.\\n\\nAmong potential contenders, only the Nationals, Rangers, Mariners, Indians, White Sox and Cubs are really any kind of fit for Fowler.\\n\\nBruce Levine covers the Cubs and White Sox for 670 The Score and CBSChicago.com.

       " 'Lake Shore, the Jersey Shore-esque reality show based in Toronto, has just released its first webisode. Featuring a look at the audition process, one can only guess that this three-minute peek is designed to drum up some attention for a production that\\'s \"still in negotiations\" regarding television distribution.\\n\\nAnd a peek it is. Given that the members of the cast have yet to be selected, we mostly get to see people trying their best to look like they\\'re partying hard, despite the early hour of the auditions.\\n\\nBoasting about how very colourful everyone is, the show\\'s host, Susie Iliyan, walks us through a few forced interviews with those hoping to make the cut. Highlights include a dude flexing his pecs, multiple people offering un-ironic duckfaces, others sticking out their tongues (that means you\\'re confident, you know...), and a healthy dose of cleavage thrown in for good measure.\\n\\nThe whole thing is a tad painful to watch, which, I suspect, is mostly the point. When one tunes into shows like Jersey Shore, it\\'s precisely for such cringe-inducing moments. Intentional or not, people are captivated by such \"drama\" because it implicitly confirms their cultural and intellectual superiority. It wouldn\\'t be a stretch to say that this is the primary reason for the wild popularity of reality television in general.\\n\\nSo instead of railing about how dumb everyone looks and lamenting how hard they\\'re trying to look cool, the only complaint I really have with this first glimpse of the show is that it appears to fit into that old arc in which a Canadian show does a shitty job of copying an already popular U.S. production (JacLife meet the Hills).\\n\\nPotentially more troublesome, however, is the show\\'s desire \"to answer the question what happens when eight vibrant and volatile twenty-something Torontonians from different backgrounds, cultures and sexual orientations shack up?\"\\n\\nIs this really a question that requires answering? Doesn\\'t this happen all the time? Sure these will be eight strangers, but lines like this give the distinct sense that those responsible for Lake Shore hope that some sort of racial or cultural tension will fuel the drama of the show.\\n\\nThe saving grace of Jersey Shore, on the other hand, is that the characters\\' collective cultural background is treated as lightheartedly as it is stereotypically.\\n\\nIt\\'s doubtful that a similar dynamic is possible with Lake Shore. Hypothetically speaking, if each cast member were selected to function as a cultural stereotype, the result would be anything but a representation of Toronto\\'s diversity.\\n\\nQuite the opposite. To be a young urbanite living in Toronto is to be disinterested in what ensues when people of diverse backgrounds are put together under one roof. We already know the answer.

       " 'The United States has threatened to replace the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) unless the body stops criticizing Israel’s oppressive measures against Palestinians.\\n\\n“We are either going to reform this thing and make it reflect what it should be reflecting or we will withdraw our support for it,” US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told a House of Representatives’ Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Wednesday.\\n\\nHe said Washington would replace the mechanism with “other means” over its intermittent critical reports on the regime’s activities in the occupied Palestinian territories in specific and against Palestinians in general.\\n\\nIn the event US withdrew from the UNHRC, Washington would “approach human rights issues on a multi-lateral basis with partners who see it the same way we do,” he added.\\n\\nIn March, the Council passed a series of anti-Israeli resolutions, including a motion condemning Israel for its illegal construction activities in Tel Aviv-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem al-Quds, and the Golan Heights, which belongs to Syria, urging states and firms to avoid ties with Israeli settlements.\\n\\nLast week, the UNHRC issued a report, which offered to “advise and support” efforts to create a “blacklist” database of the companies working with the settlements so the countries seeking to boycott them would know them.\\n\\nA UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva\\n\\nBuilding on a threat\\n\\nAlso in March, the United States said it was considering ending its participation in the Council over the body’s “bias” and “obsession” with Israel. In a speech before the Geneva-based UNHRC, US envoy Erin Barclay said Washington “remains deeply troubled by the Council’s consistent unfair and unbalanced focus on…Israel.”\\n\\nThe United States is currently an elected member of the 47-state UNHRC, where its three-year term ends in 2019. According to the Council itself, any country wishing to revoke its membership would have to go through the General Assembly in New York.\\n\\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump is especially angry at a December resolution of the United Nations Security Council, which demanded Tel Aviv end illegal settlement activities in the occupied lands of Palestine.\\n\\nAiming for reports one by one\\n\\nEarlier in the year, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) published a report, accusing Israel of “apartheid.”\\n\\nRima Khalaf, the under-secretary general and executive secretary at ESCWA, subsequently resigned due to coercive measures used against her to withdraw the report. The world body finally withdrew the report under pressure from a drive spearheaded by Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon and endorsed by Washington.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nMost recently, however, ESCWA braved the prospects of renewed pressure by issuing another report accusing Israeli troops of using disproportionate force against Palestinians and in some cases of “extrajudicial executions.”\\n\\nIt said that Israeli forces had killed 63 Palestinians, including 19 children, and wounded an additional 2,276 Palestinians, including 562 children, between April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017.\\n\\nIt also cited the UN Committee Against Torture and its concern about “Israeli practices towards Palestinian detainees,” and said “no criminal investigation was opened into more than 1,000 complaints of torture or ill-treatment filed since 2001.”\\n\\nDanon said he would work to have the report removed, too.',\n",

       " 'In the twenty-first century there are now many people who consider zoos extremely cruel: remove wild animals from their habitats and put them on display in cages for people’s enjoyment seems really ruthless. What you may not know is that throughout history zoos have not only been famous for animals, but also to exhibit human beings (human zoos).\\n\\nThe human zoos in history\\n\\nOne of the first zoos we know of is that of the Aztec Emperor Montezuma, in Mexico.\\n\\nNot only it displayed various species of animals, but also albino people, dwarfs or humps.\\n\\nEven Columbus brought Native Americans back to the Old Continent to show them to the Spanish Court.\\n\\nDuring the Renaissance, however, the Medici family had a menagerie (a precursor of the zoo) in the Vatican that exhibited exotic animals, but also people of different ethnic groups such as the Moors, Tartars, Indians, Turks and Africans.\\n\\nThe human zoos in the modern age\\n\\nIt’s around 1870 that the human zoos began to become very famous. Human shows were organized in various European and American cities and obtained great success, often attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors.\\n\\nOne human zoo was also present during the first World’s Fair held in Paris in 1899.\\n\\nThe people, mostly put on display in cages and fenced areas, were people taken from the African continent or America and were kept with typical clothing or sometimes naked.\\n\\nThe purpose of these zoos was primarily to show the variety of human beings present in the world, sometimes classifying them as past evolutionary levels. Sometimes entire villages were rebuilt to show how the natives lived in different countries.\\n\\nOta Benga\\n\\nOne of the most famous people on display in a human zoo was Ota Benga, a Congolese pygmy who was kept in a fenced area with the company of a monkey.\\n\\nOta had escaped the massacre of his village by Belgian settlers because he was out hunting. On his return he was captured by slavers who later sold him to Samuel Phillips Verner, who was in Africa to look for subjects to be put on display in the zoo.\\n\\nVerner bought Ota in exchange for salt and clothes. Although it may sound strange, this was the salvation for Ota that otherwise would have ended up being used as a slave on plantations.\\n\\nThe boy and Verner established a strong bond and when Verner travelled back to Africa he brought with him. Ota however, no longer feeling he belonged to these people, decided to return to the United States.\\n\\nThe Hottentot Venus\\n\\nAnother star of the human zoo was Saartjie Baartman, also known as the “Hottentot Venus”.\\n\\nSaartjie was a Khoikhoi woman from South West Africa who had steatopygia, a condition of lordosis and strong predisposition to accumulate fat on the buttocks, typical of some African populations.\\n\\nShe was captured and sold to a London entrepreneur when she was twenty and was shown in various exhibitions, almost naked to show her body then considered very unusual.\\n\\nThe end of human zoos\\n\\nIn the first half of ‘900 some people began to feel indignant towards these human zoos and slowly they began to be abolished.\\n\\nThe last was abolished in Belgium in 1958 but the first was oddly abolished by Hitler, BBC reports.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nIn the spring of 2016, former CIA officer Evan McMullin spoke to the University of Pennsylvania\\'s Washington semester program about his views on the United States\\' ideological foundations. McMullin launched an independent presidential bid Monday. Photo via University of Pennsylvania\\n\\nEvan McMullin, the conservative Republican and former CIA officer making a late independent bid for the White House, is poised to get a boost from a new super PAC being formed by two GOP strategists with experience in third-party ballot access.\\n\\nKahlil Byrd, who served as chief executive of Americans Elect, a now-shuttered organization that sought to create a pathway for an independent presidential candidate in 2012, and Chris Ashby, a GOP campaign finance attorney who worked on that effort, are together launching a new super PAC called Stand Up America to support McMullin.\\n\\n\"We want to be the conduit for people to be able to stand up and not just support his candidacy, but the efforts of an independent to satisfy the American people’s need for something more than they have seen,\" Byrd told The Washington Post. \"We are down to the two major party candidates, yet people are still looking for someone else.\"\\n\\nUntil recently, Byrd had been serving as an adviser to Better for America, a nonprofit group that was laying the groundwork for a third-party candidate to gain ballot access this year. When he heard that McMullin was planning to run, Byrd resigned from the organization over the weekend so he and Ashby could launch the super PAC, he said. They did not discuss their plans with McMullin, Byrd added.\\n\\nIn the spring of 2016, Republican Evan McMullin spoke to the University of Pennsylvania\\'s Washington semester program about his views on the United States\\' ideological foundations. McMullin announced Aug. 8 that he\\'s running for president. (Penn in Washington)\\n\\nThe group faces a tight time frame in which to raise money and ramp up its operations. Byrd said the super PAC already has some financial commitments, which he declined to identify, adding that the organization plans to roll out a full political team later this week.\\n\\n\"The timeline is a quick one,\" Byrd acknowledged. \"We need to be active and operating at a high clip by the time we get to Labor Day.\"\\n\\nIndeed, McMullin\\'s late start puts him at a severe disadvantage, as he is entering the race long after ballot access has closed in many states. But both Byrd and Ashby said there was sufficient time for the first-time candidate to gain sufficient ballot access to put him in reach of 270 electoral votes, both through states still accepting signatures and others where his campaign could sue to gain access.\\n\\nAshby said the super PAC will not be involved in ballot access efforts, but will instead focus on voter outreach using \"all the tools at our disposal,\" including TV and digital ads, live events and grass-roots organizing.\\n\\n\"Our strategy will be focused on connecting and engaging the many millions of Americans who are hungry for another choice and an independent choice for president,\" Ashby said, adding: \"Anything is possible this year, and we think this is possible. We are going to run an aggressive, independent campaign.\"\\n\\nUntil Monday, McMullin, who was policy director for the House Republican Conference, had little public presence. But Byrd, who first met the former CIA operative in 2011 when he came to present a reform proposal on congressional gerrymandering to Americans Elect, said he believes McMullin\\'s independent candidacy will resonate.\\n\\n\"We’re at a moment where one of the significant parts of a candidate\\'s experiences that American voters are examining is foreign policy and understanding America’s place in the world, and Evan has lived that, as operative in CIA and more recently working in Congress,\" Byrd said, adding that McMullin is \"someone who is serious and stable and focused.\"',\n",
       " 'Doctors are calling Gilead Sciences’ new hepatitis C drug a “game changer.” The pill, called sofosbuvir, is more effective than comparable drugs, works more quickly and makes treatment less painful.\\n\\n“Suddenly, it’s realistic to think we can cure most patients with hepatitis C,” said Dr. Greg Fitz, president of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, in a news conference where Gilead presented research on sofosbuvir.\\n\\nBut patient rights advocates argue that the drug’s price tag — an estimated $84,000 per treatment — puts sofosbuvir out of reach for many.\\n\\nThe Food and Drug Administration gave the go-ahead on Dec. 6. Gilead will own the market in the United States for at least 20 years before generic drug producers can get in the game and bring prices down.\\n\\nBut in India, advocates for affordable medicine are fighting to block the pharmaceutical company’s patent. If they win, the country will be able to crank out low-cost copies of the drug for millions in India and other developing countries.\\n\\nIn the meantime, in Singapore last week, dignitaries from 12 countries met to hammer out a trade agreement that threatens to ban such lawsuits.\\n\\nAs part of the pact, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, US negotiators are attempting to strengthen pharmaceutical patents, lengthen monopoly protection beyond the typical 20-year limit and dismantle international laws that enable poor countries, where high costs may bar sick people from getting medicine, to develop cheaper alternatives.\\n\\nIndia was not represented at the negotiating table and isn’t slated to sign the deal, but experts say the outcomes of the talks could still have significant consequences for the country and the future of generic drugs.\\n\\nHepatitis treatment for all\\n\\nHepatitis C, an infectious disease that attacks the liver and often leads to cancer, is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact. Most often associated with intravenous drug use, infection can also be traced back to poorly sterilized medical equipment or inadequately screened blood transfusions.\\n\\n“You can pick it up at the dentist or during surgery,” said Leena Menghaney, the coordinator for Doctor’s Without Borders’ access to affordable medicine campaign in India. “The symptoms move slowly, so you may not know you are sick for a decade.”\\n\\nNinety percent of hepatitis C patients live in low- and middle-income countries. In India, the World Health Organization estimates as many as 12 million people may be chronically infected with hepatitis C. Nearly 96,000 Indians die from the infection each year.\\n\\nUntil now, doctors primarily have been treating the infection with two drugs: interferon alfa, which is given in weekly injections for 24 or 48 weeks, and daily tablets of ribavirin. The combination can cause debilitating side effects, including flulike symptoms, anemia and depression, and it only cures about half of patients.\\n\\nGilead’s new drug, a daily pill, boasts a 90 percent cure rate and much fewer side effects, Menghaney said. Because the treatment is administered orally and not intravenously, it wouldn’t require a trained doctor to administer — a perk that’s especially important in poor countries where healthcare workers are in short supply.\\n\\n“This drug could save millions of lives in developing countries,” Menghaney said. “It’s a complete game changer in public health.”\\n\\nEven before sofosbuvir came along, treatment for hepatitis C was out of reach for many in India, which the World Bank reports had a per capita GDP of $1,489 in 2012. One vial of the injectable drug interferon costs $350.\\n\\n“Patients sell their homes, their gold, everything they have to get treatment,” said Menghaney. “Some people even take out bank loans.”\\n\\nThe cost is prohibitive even for NGOs. Doctors Without Borders runs India’s only free-of-cost hepatitis C program. Menghaney said drug companies would not negotiate a deal with the NGO, so it has only been able to enroll three patients.\\n\\n“The treatment just isn’t scalable,” she said. “We need generic competition to bring down the prices.”\\n\\nThe Initiative for Medicines, Access and Knowledge, a legal group based in New York, is challenging Gilead’s patent on the grounds that sofosbuvir is based on an “old science.” India’s patent laws don’t consider new forms of a known substance to be innovative unless it improves efficacy.\\n\\n“India’s patent law doesn’t give monopolies for old science or for compounds that are already in the public domain,” said I-MAK director Tahir Amin in a press release. “We believe this patent on sofosbuvir does not deserve to be granted in India and have the legal grounds to prove it.”\\n\\nA recent study from Britain’s Liverpool University suggests a 12-week course of the drug could be produced for as little as $62 to $134.\\n\\n“It only takes a few grams of these drugs to cure hepatitis C,” study author Andrew Hill told Forbes. “Companies have a choice: continue treating a very small number of people with hepatitis C at a very high cost, or expanding access to these treatments, lowering treatment costs significantly, and working towards eradication of this disease.”\\n\\nIn response to the patent opposition, Gilead told PharmaTimes that it is committed to making sure hepatitis C treatments reach as many patients as possible.\\n\\n“As we did with our current HIV access program, we are working very closely with advocates in the communities that are affected by HCV to develop an appropriate access and pricing strategy,” Gilead stated.\\n\\nA regional trade deal with global impacts\\n\\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade deal between the US, Canada and 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is one of several regional and sub-regional trade negotiations that have sprung up in recent years as World Trade Organization talks have hit an impasse.\\n\\nUS leaders have called the TPP the first step in an attempt to import stricter rules into the World Trade Organization.\\n\\n“Our goal is for high standards for the Trans-Pacific Partnership to enter the bloodstream of the global system and improve the rules and norms,” said Vice President Joe Biden in a speech in April. “What we’re talking about is shaping a new standard that then becomes the metric by which all future trade agreements are measured.”\\n\\nAs part of the deal, US negotiators have attempted to crack down on pre-patent oppositions, like the one that has been filed against Gilead. In a draft of the trade agreement published by Wikileaks in November, the TPP forbade challenges to patents until after they were granted.\\n\\nDrug companies say stronger patent protection is necessary to allow them to recover investments and continue research. But activist groups like Doctors Without Borders argue that stricter intellectual property rules will delay the development of generic drugs and keep healthcare prices high.\\n\\nUnless India joins the TPP (which isn’t an unheard-of proposal), advocates for affordable medicine will still be able to file pre-grant oppositions, said Amitendu Palit, a senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore. India’s scientists can continue to develop generics and distribute them to Indians.\\n\\nBut, member or not, because India is the world’s biggest producer of generic medicine, the country’s economy would likely sustain a hefty hit if the trade agreement is passed as written, Palit said. TPP countries represent 40 percent of the world’s gross domestic product and a number of them import generic drugs from India. When the pact goes into effect, those countries will have to close their accounts.\\n\\n“When the TPP kicks in with much stronger intellectual property rules, Indian producers will be feeling the heat,” he said.\\n\\nThe TPP also includes an anti-counterfeit provision, which empowers customs officials to seize shipments of drugs they suspect to be counterfeit without a formal complaint. Because generic drugs are more susceptible to counterfeit, Palit said, even valid shipments from India are likely to run into roadblocks.\\n\\n“Say there’s a TPP country located between India and another country where generic shipments from India are travelling,” Palit said, “India’s trucks are going to become targets.”\\n\\nThe tension between India and US pharmaceutical companies is longstanding. India’s patent system is notorious for tripping up US patent holders. Each year, generic medicines companies based in India chip away a larger share of the US market.\\n\\nIn a landmark decision in April, India’s Supreme Court denied the pharmaceutical company Novartis AG patent protection for its cancer drug Glivec. A slue of hits to the pharmaceutical industry followed. Roche lost its patent for the hepatitis C drug Pagasys. Merck was denied a patent for asthma treatment Singlulair. Gilead’s HIV drug Viread and Pfizer’s cancer drug Sutent both failed to win patents.\\n\\nMembers of the Senate finance committee and a group of 170 House legislators this summer prevailed upon Secretary of State John Kerry to address the issue, saying Indian patent policies were undermining US business innovation.\\n\\n\"Since early 2012, India\\'s policies and actions have undermined patent rights for at least nine innovative medicines,” said Pfizer’s chief intellectual property officer, Roy Waldron, testifying before a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in July. “This is not only creating significant uncertainty in the market but it also undermines our ability to compete fairly in India, and our willingness to invest there.\"\\n\\nMore from GlobalPost: Secretive trade pact called \\'most harmful ever\\' for affordable medicine',\n",

Keep in mind that we’re reaching the point in the season where most roles are becoming clearly defined, thus a seemingly limited supply of waiver wire additions in deeper competitive leagues. If you’re a fan of my weekly rankings they will be published every Tuesday on ourand updated on a daily basis until kickoff. For one low price you also gain access to our daily NBA projections and private discord chat . Players appearing in my week 9 waiver wire article are owned in 50% or fewer of Yahoo leagues.To this point in his career, Damien Williams has been below average (not seeing over 4 YPC through three seasons), while doing most of his work in the passing game:With Jay Ajayi being traded to the Eagles owners should be scrambling to add the next man up in Miami, and while many depth charts say Williams, my money is on Kenyan Drake who Adam Gase anointed as the No. 2 running back back on October 6th . As you can see from Damien Williams 3 year stats he has more success in the passing game meaning Kenyan Drake should handle the early down work and goal line situations. In his only real work this season (week 8) Kenyan posted 6 carries for 22 yards against the Baltimore Ravens, and is now in line for 15+ carries per week (admittedly for one of the worst offenses in the NFL). SO WHY THE HIGH BID? This will be the question potential owners are asking, and the truth is you do not find starting running backs off the wire at this point in the season. Even in the event of an injury its likely the handcuffs around the league are owned. If you need a low end RB2 or weekly flex play, Kenyan Drake is the best bet for production assuming the Cowboys RB’s are all owned.By the time I’m finished writing this sentence Zeke’s suspension will probably be overturned again as this crazy saga of court battles continues. Elliott has 24 hours to final an appeal, which he almost certainly will do, so owners will have to follow the news closely. If the Elliott suspension is still expected to be upheld heading into Tuesday night Darren McFadden is a must add in all leagues. We still don’t know who the starter will be between DMC and Alfred Morris (in fact I’m holding both in my 12 team league). If you made me choose today, I’d go with McFadden as the guy, but if possible scoop up both as whoever fills the early down / goal line role will have solid RB2 value for 6 weeks.Juju Smith-Schuster drove the nail into Martavis Bryant’s coffin on Sunday night with a terrific 7 reception 193 yard 1 TD performance against the Detroit Lions, including a 97 catch and run that showed his explosive speed as he ran away from the Detroit secondary. Pittsburgh is on bye in week 9 so you’ll have to sit on this pickup for a week, however the schedule is positively juicy coming out of the bye with IND, TEN and GB all on the horizon. If you need a weekly WR3 and Juju is somehow still available he is the top waiver wire add heading into week 9Its surprising that Doyle is somehow still available in over 50% of Yahoo leagues as he has been racking up the targets from Jacoby Brissett. Over his past 3 games Doyle has seen an incredible 32 targets which has been converted to 25 receptions for 215 yards and 2 TD’s. Given the Colts poor defense they should be playing from behind plenty over the second half of the season, and Doyle appears to be Jacoby’s favorite target. If you need a TE and Doyle is somehow available scoop him up off waivers.As long time readers know, I like to follow the snap counts when scooping up WR’s off the waiver wire, however this is an interesting situation as Lockett is actually seeing more targets (Lockett 15 – Richardson 9) over the past 2 weeks. So the WR3 is seeing the superior targets, however Richardson is getting the red zone looks with 3 TD’s to Lockett’s 0 over the same time frame. I have to give the nod to Richardson here if you’re looking to acquire a WR off waivers thanks to Paul’s superior snap count and red zone looks. The only reason I don’t have Richardson as a must add is the notoriously fluky nature of touchdowns for guys not named Will Fuller.Things didn’t go exactly as planned for Doctson on Sunday against the Cowboys as he caught just one pass for one yard and a TD. The Redskins are quickly turning into the 2014 Chiefs who managed to go a full season without a WR touchdown. (The comparison here is meant for fantasy owners, in that there has been limited fantasy appeal at the WR position in WAS so far this season). The good news is that Doctson (50) had the 2nd most snaps to Crowder (56) so the targets should eventually materialize. If you are a Terrelle Pryor owner he now appears to be droppable as he has fallen to 4th on the depth chart behind Ryan Grant.Fantasy owners will be asking what has changed with Alex Collins from last week, and truthfully the answer is nothing. It was still a timeshare for the Ravens as Collins handled 18 carries to Javorious Allen’s 17 however Collins once again looked like the more explosive option as he went for 113 yards (while adding an additional 2 receptions for 30 yards). Unless we get word from Ravens practice that Collins is moving into the featured role I’d expect the timeshare to continue making Alex a risky boom or bust flex play thus the low suggested FAAB bid.Well here’s a surprise… Jordan Reed is injured again . Reed will likely be questionable all week with his balky hamstring so keep an eye out for injury updates. If he is ruled out before waivers open Vernon Davis looks like a nice one week plug and play against a Seattle defense that was just lit up by Deshaun Watson. Kirk Cousins has been consistently targeting his TE’s this season for big gains as evidenced by Vernon’s 17 catches for 292 yards (18.3 yards per catch). With injuries impacting Zach Miller, Charles Clay and Jordan Reed in recent weeks Vernon could be a viable option in deeper leagues with limited options.Fantasy owners have a way of ignoring guys who were on bye when waivers open so make sure you check to see if Marqise Lee (the WR1 for the Jags) is still available. Before their bye this past week Lee had 6 targets for 4 receptions and 72 yards. The week before that? 10 targets, 5 receptions and 83 yards. If you don’t want to be in a bidding war, or find yourself low on the waiver wire priority list take a look at Marqise as a viable WR3 for the 2nd half of your fantasy season.With McCown’s (25% owned also worth a pickup) solid play for the Jets Robby Anderson has slowly started to put together some consistency with 7+ fantasy points in 3 straight weeks including 2 straight games with a touchdown. Week 9 is no picnic as Anderson and the Jets will face the Bills, however their week 10 matchup with the Bucs looks much more favorable.

       " '🇺🇸 Happy Fourth everyone! ‘Murica Fuck Yeah! 🇺🇸\\n\\nIf you haven’t heard yet, we recently got a Ford Transit cargo van and are currently converting it to a camper van. It will be our ultimate ad-van-ture vehicle.\\n\\nThese past 3 weeks, we focused on learning about van flooring and building it. I watched countless YouTube videos and read many blogs to see the different options that were available out there and there’s a lot! We settled with the instruction of this particular blog/YouTube person. His step-by-steps for the flooring was greatly helpful in giving me an understanding of what needed to be done. There are many ways one can build a van depending on their needs. This is what we’ve done:\\n\\nInitial Setup\\n\\n2006 Ford Expedition\\n\\nWe always like the versatility of our SUV, the ability to sleep in the back & the small but convenient kitchen kit. The SUV itself was insulated enough for our need. As backpackers, we are accustomed to sleeping in cold weather and being comfortable. We used our time car camping in the SUV to give us a frame of reference of what we’d need for the van.\\n\\nWe are not planning on insulating the van to an extreme as we plan on being in areas where it’s warm enough. If we ever end up in cold weather, a small portable heat source, such as a Mr. Buddy heater, will work plenty for us.\\n\\n2017 Ford Transit Van conversion\\n\\nSound deadener\\n\\nFirst task was to install the ‘Sound deadener’ material to cover the wheel wells to reduce the noise while driving. The installation was easy as it was a peel and stick type of material. We can definitely tell the different when driving now.\\n\\nInsulating the floor\\n\\nWe purchased poly-iso board and laid it on the floor. One Two can of 3M 90 glue worked great to fix the boards to the van floor. I used ‘Great Stuff’ insulating foam to fill in the gaps between those boards and the van’s floor. I let everything dry overnight and cut the excess off to make the floor as even as possible the next day. We had to keep in mind if we lay anything thick on the floor, we would lose head room in the van. Bryan, being 6’3″, we wanted to keep as much height as possible. We also installed a thin cushion layer between the plywood and the foam boards that also acts low insulating layer to the floor. We used Reflectix and glued it down with the same 3M 90 can we had.\\n\\nPlywood for the floor\\n\\nI purchased 3 sanded 15/32″ plywood pieces and made paper templates out of builder paper of the wheelwells and van middle ribs. We were able to borrow a jig saw from a neighbor in the RV park. (Thanks Tom!) Measure twice and cut once! We have applied a light layer of shellac coating to the wood to provide a light protective coating.\\n\\nFixing the floor to the van’s body.\\n\\nFrom underneath the vehicle, we drilled holes through the van and our plywood floor. We fastened the bolt and sprayed an undercoating to prevent rust. The floor is now forever-ish affixed to the body of the van! The tutorial said to put in about 18 bolts. We realized that most of the areas that would be good to bolt down, were inaccessible underneath the van because of the different car parts like the gas tank, drive shaft and other parts (I’m clueless when it comes to car parts) etc…\\n\\nApplying vinyl sheet\\n\\nOn Monday, I got my vinyl glue and trowel out and started laying the glue on the plywood. Our trowel had large notches which dispensed a lot more glue than needed, yikes! I unrolled the vinyl sheet on top of the glue and used a piece of wood wrapped in a shirt to roll any bubbles out. Many still remained despite our effort. Most of the floor will be covered with furniture in the next few weeks so we’re not too worried. We applied a light layer of silicone around the floor where it meets the wall for added protection.\\n\\nFraming\\n\\nI bolted down multiple 2×1 wood beams to the metal wall of the van. This will serve as our main frame once we start building the furniture. We’ll screw the furniture to these beams. Cargo vans are built to be customized, it already had several 3/8″ holes in the wall that I was able to use to bolt my frame to.\\n\\nFloor Trim\\n\\nThe final task was to add the trims to the exposed sides of the floor. We chose step trims and carpet trim to finish. Initially, we wanted a silver trim but that changed when we saw this brass color that looked great with the flooring. We used a hacksaw and jigsaw to cut the trim and created the 45° angle where they meet.\\n\\nEt Voilà! The floor is now done and we can start partying working some more in there. We hit plenty of bumps in the road (HA!) but we’re happy with the results. There’s a lot more ahead of us but we’ll take a break and focus on backpacking and adventuring since we haven’t done that in FOREVER.\\n\\n*This is how we’ve done our flooring but there are other ways and material that can be used.\\n\\nCanada Day was on the 1st, so happy belated 150th birthday 🇨🇦 CANADA! 🇨🇦',\n",

       " 'We’ve spent the last month investigating many angles within virtual reality—from its implications on the web, to how VR can create peak emotional experiences on demand, to discussing whether it is okay if we prefer VR to our own physical reality.\\n\\nLast week, we brought the dialogue to Singularity University with the Future of Virtual Reality Event. After demos and during a panel discussion at the event, the speakers hit on an area that we have yet to cover in depth—learning and education.\\n\\nDuring the panel, Jazmin Cano, co-founder of VR gaming company Winistry and previously lead tech artist at Discovr Labs, guided the conversation to the subject of education and how we might use VR to create educational environments that are conducive for learners that thrive in more visual and immersive settings.\\n\\nPicture this: You’re a ninth grade student enrolled in a mandatory biology course, and science is not your forte. Every time you sit down in class and watch the daily PowerPoint lecture, you struggle to follow the teacher and walk out realizing you captured pages of notes, but no real understanding of the subject matter.\\n\\nIt’s frustrating.\\n\\nOne day, you find a VR headset sitting at each table, and your teacher explains that today you’ll learn about the inner workings of the human bloodstream. You put on the headset, and the next thing you know, you’re flying through the bloodstream. You see cells passing by, and there’s even a little guy guiding you through the session, explaining each variable you’re interacting with as it passes.\\n\\nIt turns out this scenario is already happening.\\n\\n“There’s actually one child from the children’s hospital who tried it, and he was dyslexic, so reading from pages was hard for him in the first place,” Cano said. “But being able to go into the body and learning that way, he was able to understand how the body works more than from just reading it. And that’s something that we think could really help a lot of people.”\\n\\nOne of the largest challenges facing education is the one-size-fits-all model that most curriculums follow. For the many students who are different types of learners—visual, experiential, spatial, kinesthetic—traditional classroom learning models leave them in the dark. The information simply does not stick.\\n\\nImagine taking tests in VR with a personal guide that adapted to the learning style of each user—reading exam questions to auditory learners, or creating a more peaceful test-taking environment for those who experience testing anxiety.\\n\\nCurrently, different types of learners are disadvantaged in the classroom and pigeonholed as low performers. Many times, however, it has nothing to do with the intelligence of the individual. The possibilities opened by bringing VR to the classroom for these students would literally be gamechanging—grade changing.\\n\\n“If I had learned science with VR, I would have been a straight A student.” – Ryan Pulliam\\n\\nWe’d love to hear from you: Tweet to us @singularityhub or to me @DigitAlison with your ideas and comments.\\n\\nImage Credit: Shutterstock.com',\n",
       " 'Iona Institute makes significant U-turn by registering with Standards in Public Office Commission\\n\\nThe Iona Institute has made a significant U-turn by finally registering as a third party with the Standards in Public Office Commission, just seven weeks after they made a declaration to the Commission that they did not consider that they had to register, and less than a week after Atheist Ireland challenged that decision in a letter to the Commission.\\n\\nThe Standards Commission has a supervisory role under the Ethics and Electoral Acts. A third party is a person or group, other than a political party of election candidate, that has accepted a donation for political purposes exceeding €100.\\n\\nIona’s U-turn means that one of two scenarios must have happened:\\n\\nScenario One: Coincidence\\n\\nBetween August 2006 and 4 March 2015, the Iona Institute never received any donations for political purposes exceeding €100. They then received their first ever such donation sometime between then and 23 April 2015, which by coincidence was just after Atheist Ireland had contacted the Commission about them.\\n\\nScenario Two: Incompetence\\n\\nBetween August 2006 and 4 March 2015, the Iona Institute did in fact receive such donations for political purposes. They did not understand their obligations under the law, even when the Commission wrote to explain them, and they only realised their mistake on 23 April 2015, just after Atheist Ireland had contacted the Commission about them.\\n\\nTimescale\\n\\nHere is the timescale involved in the Iona Institute’s U-turn:\\n\\nOn 25 January 2015, Atheist Ireland contacted the Standards Commission on our own initiative, and we received a registration form and explanatory notes for third parties. On 4 February we registered with the Commission, and the Commission told us that it would update its register of third parties as soon as possible.\\n\\nOn 20 February, The Standards Commission wrote to the Iona Institute (and to other organisations known to the Commission) and asked them to consider whether or not they should register as a third party with the Commission, and to confirm whether or not they had received a donation, given for political purposes, in excess of €100.\\n\\nOn 4 March, the Iona Institute responded to the Commission, and confirmed that they had not received any donations for political purposes that exceeded €100, and therefore they did not consider that any requirement to register as a third party with the Standards Commission arose.\\n\\nOn 17 April, Atheist Ireland wrote to the Standards Commission asking why three organisations were not registered with them (the Catholic Church, the Humanist Association of Ireland, and the Iona Institute). We gave the Commission examples of these organisations carrying out activities that are captured by the definition of political purposes.\\n\\nOn 20 April, the Commission responded to Atheist Ireland. They told us that, in the absence of concrete evidence that a group has accepted a donation, given for political purposes, in excess of €100, it is the Commission’s practice to accept a group’s declaration that it has considered it should register as a third party and the group’s confirmation that it has not accepted such a donation. The Commission added that, should any person have actual evidence (not hearsay) that a group has made a false declaration to the Commission then the Commission would be grateful to receive such evidence.\\n\\nOn 23 April, the Iona Institute registered with the Commission, and it now appears on the register of third parties. This means that the Iona Institute has now confirmed that it has accepted a donation, given for political purposes, in excess of €100, having told the Commission the opposite just seven weeks ago.\\n\\nLimits on Donations\\n\\nIf it is the case that the Iona Institute did not understand their obligations under the law, even when the Commission wrote to explain them, they might also want to familiarise themselves with some of the other limitations on donations that they can lawfully receive for political purposes.\\n\\nDonations include money, property or goods, free use of property or goods, free supply of services, discounts on usual commercial prices, profits from political fundraisers, or notional donations also known as donations in kind.\\n\\nThey cannot accept an anonymous donation for political purposes exceeding €100, or a cash donation for political purposes exceeding €200.\\n\\nThey cannot accept a donation, or donations from the same donor, for political purposes, in any calendar year exceeding an aggregate value of €2,500.\\n\\nThey cannot accept a donation for political purposes of whatever value, from an individual (other than an Irish citizen) who resides outside the island of Ireland.\\n\\nThey cannot accept a donation for political purposes from a body corporate or unincorporated body of persons which does not keep an office in the island of Ireland from which one or more of its principal activities is directed.\\n\\nThey cannot accept a donation for political purposes exceeding €200 in any calendar year from a corporate donor, unless the corporate donor is registered in the register of Corporate Donors maintained by the Standards Commission and other criteria are met.',\n",

       " 'I was looking for an unforgettable trip and I definitely got it!\\n\\n\\n\\na friend and I went to a weekend trip to LA to see what it got. we got to santa monica on saturday morning and spent the day on the beach, went to beberly hills and hollywood. we were looking for a place to stay since we didnt make a reservation. so we were looking for a place to stay in the hollywood 6 motel. but there wasnt any room for us. so we used our fancy GPS to find another one and sent us to Van Vuys. we got there again to the 6 motel, but we saw this other motels on the road. and the voyager motor inn got this good rate, so we went there. as other guys said in here. the first sight. looks like a place to have sex but we didnt realise the hole stuff. so we checked in, as long as we made it. there was this gang style guy coming into the hotel. it scared me, but i said ok. dont be a pussy, its just one guy, he might also be a normal person, not a gang guy. so we took our car and got into the parking. we didnt get the instructions to get into the building so we went to the cristal door on the parking entrace, and it was locked. went back to the parking trying to find a door and saw this couple whom I asked for the dorr. the guy barely looked at me and say I dont know where it is. so ok. i made a joke about it and walked to a blue door I found. so yeahp. we were in the building which didnt look as the entrace at all. it was a MAZE. there was a low light with all those corridors were really spooky, and after the gang look like guy, i was starting to be afraid it was not a good place. so we got to our rooms and the doors were really weak, and didnt want to open, and the phone was ringing. once I made it, i picked the phone up, it was the girl from the front desk. my friend had left his passport there, we needed to pick it up. so i got out my room again and there was a lady talling to my fiend, luckyly he didnt speak english, he didnt know what she was telling him. and i didnt know what was the deal. we went to the frontdesk, to pick the passport, we were there, and another gangstyle guy came in, so we picked the passport and walked to our rooms again. we saw two guys sitting there on the stairs whatching us. so we just walked and got into our rooms and before entering I joked \"close the door and dont open even if anyone knocks\". the room was small, didnt smell that bad, but it looked terryfing. I ripped off the blankets to check for any unwanted thing animal or not animal, but it seemed clean enough. checked on ever door for anything unwanted, since I was already frightened! everything seemed to be OK. so i just turned off the light and tried to have a sleep. I heard lots of noise, people fighting, children crying, loud music, Luckily no one knocked. the shower was not that that bad. Im not that special for hotels. Ive been to a bunch of hotels even in so rustic places, but this one definitely freaked me out. I tought someone was coming in to steal or kill me. and as I read other comments I really think we were lucky. My friend wasnt that freaked, until today we read the comments. I told him on sunday morning i just read about an killed guy on a motels parcking. So. at the end if you guys are looking for some extreme adventures get here. if you like a little bit more safety and peace. look for anotehr place.',\n",
       " 'because, of, you know, reasons. For those unfamiliar, Alignment is a personality trait characters possess in Dungeons & Dragons. But if you’re unfamiliar, you’re probably not going to get a lot of use out of this ramble, so, hrm… have a link to the new teaser for the upcoming Star Wars movie.*\\n\\nIf you stuck around anyway, you can think of alignment a bit like the Force. Each character in the game gravitates towards the light or dark side. Their connection to that inner drive towards compassion or cruelty not only influences the in-game actions they’re expected to take, but can also be detected (and manipulated!) through magic, restricts what types of roles the character can take in the world (only Good characters can traditionally be the holy warrior class called Paladins, for example), and in some cases even what equipment they can make use of.\\n\\nUnlike the Force, however, alignment’s measured in two axes, one from Good to Evil, determining moral outlook, and one from Lawful to Chaotic, determining the character’s response to the strictures of society. Both scales contain a third option—Neutral—for those characters who fall nearer the middle. Since each character is measured on both axes, there are nine total alignments a character can belong to: Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, Lawful Evil, Neutral Good, True Neutral, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Good, Chaotic Neutral, and Chaotic Evil.\\n\\nOr, in Harry Potter terms:**\\n\\nI’m of mixed feelings about Alignment. On one hand, I love it. It’s a role-play guide with associated mechanics, but those mechanics don’t hijack the action. The idea, that in a world where magic makes thought manifest, that one’s approach to the world and way of thinking has a metaphysical effect on her aura and her ability to interact with the arcane is a very compelling one, and one fully in keeping with many of the thematic underpinnings of sorcery. Furthermore, alignment forces players to consider their characters’ personalities at creation, and it provides a framework that they can always return to when the character is forced with hard decisions down the road.\\n\\n(It could be—and probably has been—argued that the alignment axes require players to reduce rather than consider their characters’ personalities, but I think that the axes tend to be fairly flexible, at least flexible enough that the good outweighs the bad. So far as providing inspiration and structure goes, anyway.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, I loathe alignment in its current form. For a variety of reasons.\\n\\nFirst, Good and Evil may have been fine back in the eighties (or the forties, when D&D arch-inspiration The Lord of the Rings was being written), but I’d like to think we have a more nuanced understanding of human behavior today. More appallingly, Good and Evil in D&D is often applied in ways that are regressive and frankly horrendous.\\n\\nBecause nothing says “Universally Evil Society” like a matriarchy of black-skinned individuals.***\\n\\nThe Lawful and Chaotic axis suffers similarly. And I love this axis. When I ran my sprawling, two-year epic campaign back in college, the struggle between Law and Chaos formed the backbone of the narrative. Part of the problem is that the term “Lawful” is just too loaded. There’s a connotation to “law” that equates it to “good.” This is reasonable in our society, since we generally expect the law to enforce the larger moral good. So we end up with a world where “Lawful” often means “civilized” and “Chaotic” often means “savage,” and all of the ugliness that logically follows.\\n\\nThere may be some problematic cultural signifiers here.****\\n\\nOn top of that, the assumption of the game is that player characters aren’t evil, which reduces the nine archetypes given above by a third.\\n\\nFinally, Neutral is boring. Neutrality is not a concept that drives character action or a guiding principle that inspires the kind of heroic action that D&D revels in.***** It’s an empty space. Characters are Good, Evil, or Not Either. They’re Lawful, Chaotic, or, uh, not.\\n\\nSo l quite like the intent of the system, but I think its implementation is pretty terrible.\\n\\nBut how do we fix it?\\n\\nGoing forward, I think when I run D&D (as if that’s a thing I do regularly) I believe I’m going to use a somewhat revised pair of axes. Feel free to steal them if they appeal to you and your group.\\n\\nThe First Axis describes a not only a character’s general disposition towards society, but how they go about responding to the world and solving problems. Some take careful, measured steps, while others are free-thinkers. Others take each situation as it comes, retaining a flexible approach to life’s challenges.\\n\\nOn the First Axis, characters are Orderly, Pragmatic, or Chaotic.\\n\\nThe Second Axis describes a character’s general approach to existing in the world and their personal tendency towards making, breaking, or protecting. Some respond to the world by being inspired by it, others by trying to take care of it, and others by imposing force upon it.\\n\\nOn the Second Axis, characters are Creative, Sustaining, or Destructive.\\n\\nNote that Destructive is value-neutral from a moral perspective. It simply means your default method of solving problems is by removing them. With pointy metal objects when necessary.\\n\\nI think that the combinations that result immediately inspire ideas for the kinds of characters that might fall into these categories:\\n\\nAn Orderly Creative character may be an architect or a lawmaker.\\n\\nAn Orderly Sustaining character might be a doctor or teacher.\\n\\nAn Orderly Destructive character may be a soldier or guard.\\n\\nA Pragmatic Creative character may be a scientist or undercover investigator.\\n\\nA Pragmatic Sustaining character may be a battlefield medic or ecologist. Or Druid, I suppose.\\n\\nA Pragmatic Destructive character may be a mercenary or private eye.\\n\\nA Chaotic Creative character may be a frenzied artist or revolutionary.\\n\\nA Chaotic Sustaining character may be a farmer or this guy:\\n\\nA Chaotic Destructive character may be a political saboteur or a berserker.\\n\\nI love these phrases. They’re active. They’re complex. They’re universal and elemental. Best of all, there’s no reason that these can’t have the same kind of impact on characters that the old Alignments did. A Circle Against Destruction could be incredibly useful. As could the spell “Sense Pragmatic.”\\n\\nI can’t wait to use these in a game. I hope you get something out of them, too.\\n\\nCheers,\\n\\nA\\n\\n*At some point maybe I should talk about my feelings on Star Wars.\\n\\n**From https://rantingsoftheninjarobot.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/harry-potter-alignment-chart/\\n\\n***That’s sarcasm, for my contextually-challenged readers.\\n\\n**** From http://digital-art-gallery.com/picture/15830\\n\\n*****In fairness, I once had a lot of fun playing a True Neutral wizard devoted to the deity of Neutral Magic, but a lot of that came out of the tension between the character’s devotion to universal balance (which is arguably a Lawful drive) and the rest of the party’s strong tendency towards Good.\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nLike this: Like Loading...

       " 'India is very keen to explore the shared future in energy network along with three key neighbouring countries, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal. These three countries have assured India at the highest level that it will abide with the Indian proposal to build energy networks.\\n\\nSimultaneously, there has also been positive signs of giving greater participation to Indian companies in Myanmar and Bangladesh’s energy sector. The way India has tried to improve bilateral relations at all levels with Myanmar and Bangladesh for the past few years, these countries are now ready to open their markets more Indian companies to do business. The Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan has visited Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal recently.\\n\\nOne of the major features of this network will be that every member country will be able to supply and fulfil the energy requirements of other participating nations. Its length will be approximately 7000 km and it will pass through Myanmar’s Sittwe (in the state of Rakhine) and Chittagong of Bangladesh besides most of the North Eastern states of India. To make this network a success, India wants a big stake in energy stores in Myanmar and Bangladesh.\\n\\nAccording to sources in the Ministry of Petroleum, the government of Bangladesh is soon going to block the private sector for exploration and excavation. These blocks are located in the most difficult areas of Bangladesh with petroleum reserves. Indian government company ONGC (Foreign) has bought two key blocks in Bangladesh in 2014 and is doing a good investment there. According to the sources, India has been given a high-level assurance in Bangladesh that the Indian companies will be given full support for this project. It was agreed that during the visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India in April 2017, that the Indian companies will invest $ 9 billion in the energy sector in Bangladesh.\\n\\nOn behalf of Bangladesh, India has been trying to get a share in the huge energy reserves of Myanmar for a long time. Due to China’s domination, India for a long time did not have massive success there, which might see a change now. During the visit of PM Narendra Modi to Myanmar earlier this month, there has been a lot of important talk about the energy sector. ONGC (Foreign) considers Myanmar as its potential attractive investment destination. The company has a stake in four blocks already, but its total production is extremely low.\\n\\nSEE MORE',\n",

The kids couldn't get too out of hand because mom was coming back and any kid would rather be greeted with a smile and a hug instead of a frown. One week, seven days, that's all she had to wait. It wasn't too bad, she had her sister and their dad and they liked to play with her, although her sister was a lot better at their games than their dad, but she would let dad play anyway, because mom always said to be nice to everyone. And she wanted nothing more than to make their mom proud.\\n\\nThe only problem was that she must have been having too much fun, because she lost track of time. She could have sworn it had been seven days since their mom left, but maybe she was just so excited that she counted ahead. She was pretty good with numbers, but even she could miss a 3 here and there. Silly mistake. She tried again, but after a little while she figured that she must have accidently counted naptime as a day. No problem. Mommy always kept promises, it hadn't been a week yet. Still, it concerned her how bad her math was. She learned how to count to seven ages ago, why was she having such trouble now? She tried for the longest time to figure out how she kept getting to 17 instead of seven, but nothing ever really seemed right. She decided she would ask mommy when the week was up and after she gave her traditional welcome back hug. Because everyone is supposed to keep their promises and mommy promised to be back in a week.\\n\\nHer sister, their father, and their uncle didn't seem to have the same amount of patience though. One night just before bedtime, he had come into the house. He looked sad, he probably missed mommy. She did too. He talked to their dad for a while in secret volume. Mommy always said that was bad, because they were supposed to share things with all the people they loved. Though sometimes, she would do it with her sister in the dark of their shared room.\\n\\nHe must have been mean to daddy, because their dad got really angry and yelled and called him a liar. It wasn't nice to yell at people, she knew that much. People don't listen when you yell. But it didn't seem like either adult cared about setting a good example. Daddy looked ready to hit him, but he just sat down on the couch really quietly and looked upset. Being called a liar must have really hurt his feelings, and plus she knew that she didn't like it when daddy yelled so clearly no one else did.\\n\\nSince mommy was gone she decided to take it upon herself to have them make nice. They were friends after all and friends shouldn't be angry at each other. She walked over to the couch and tried to climb up it. She was still too short, but their uncle laughed quietly at her and lifted her up and placed her in his lap. He smelled funny, but he ruffled her hair like he always did and smiled the kind of upset smile he used when he didn't want her to know he was upset. She gave him her best smile to make him feel better. He pulled her into a hug and held tight.\\n\\nHer sister had run into the room at the sound of all the yelling and asked what was wrong. The sound of a table being flipped was all the answer they were given. She wondered why their dad did that, the table didn't do anything wrong. Her sister looked worried and their uncle just ran his fingers through her hair. He sighed sadly and told them to come here, which she found weird because she was already here. Her sister slowly walked to the couch and climbed up, pretty purple eyes met her own silver ones. Her sister didn't know why everybody was so upset either. Arms shifted her so that she could their uncle in the face. He looked her right in the eye and told them that there was an accident. Well, less an accident and more a series of unfortunate events. Or so he said. Their dad made a bitter noise, but he didn't pay any mind to the interruption. He said that their mother wasn't coming home.\\n\\nHe was wrong of course. Her uncle was always a strange man, he was funny. But what he didn't know was that mommy always kept promises, and once a week was up he'd see. He was just being impatient really. Mommy once told her and her sister that when a person loves someone, nothing could keep them away. And mommy loved them, pure and simple. The only reason mommy wouldn't come home is if she didn't love them anymore, which was crazy because mommy also promised to love them forever, and mommy always kept promises. Her sister seemed confused. So little faith, but she really wasn't upset with her best friend. Sometimes on really long nights, she doubted it too. But not here, and not now.\\n\\nWords were thrown around the room for a little while, Grimm, dead, and hero, tended to be at the front. She didn't really understand what they were talking about. She just wondered why everyone was getting so upset. Even her sister was screaming. She didn't see the point, mommy would be back soon. She tried to tell her daddy this, but as their eyes met, something snapped. A face that was once sad, turned angrier than she had ever seen. The man who would play with her and carry her around on broad shoulders, laughing loudly the entire time, broke their eye contact and with a horrible scream and a crash, turned and punched through the wall of their living room.\\n\\nShe didn't know why daddy was angry with her. She couldn't remember doing anything bad, but maybe she had and she'd just forgotten or not known. The adults were always making up these rules and sometimes it was hard to remember them all. But still, she didn't like it when daddy was angry normally, but daddy had never been angry at her before. She didn't understand why this would be the time to start.\\n\\nHer uncle stood, setting her on the floor as he crossed the room and started yelling at their father who started yelling back. Her sister seemed frozen in terror, and her own eyes burned with tears. Chaos filled her home, and her tummy felt sick. Everybody was unhappy, but mommy always said that nobody should be sad or angry when they are home. And mommy's always right, mommy told her that much. She tried to tell them to stop fighting but no one listened to her. They probably didn't hear her over their yelling. She tried to raise her voice, but she couldn't be loud enough. Everything was too loud, it bashed against her ears and they hurt badly. It felt like someone was stepping on her chest. She couldn't breathe, the walls seemed to shrink. They tried to trap her and hold her down. Her head hurt and the world turned black at the edge of her vision. She pressed her tiny hands to her ears to drown out some of it. Nothing helped. She wanted her mommy. But mommy wasn't here. Not until a week was up.\\n\\nShe was shaking and tears blurred her vision. She wanted to run, get away from all of the yelling, find her mom. So she did. She ran away unnoticed by anyone. She found herself outside while screams echoed from the inside. Mommy would be coming back, and anyone who doubted it was a liar. She would wait forever if that was what it took.\\n\\nThe moonlight lit up the ground like daytime. It wasn't right, somethings just were never supposed to happen. Daytime was daytime and nighttime was nighttime that was how the world worked. Day would follow night, winter would follow fall, and her mom would come back. She felt cold as frustrated tears flowed down her face. Her uncle was pulling a mean joke and she wanted him to stop, it wasn't funny. It was making daddy and her sister upset. Once the week was up, mommy would yell at him for being mean.\\n\\nShe fell sleepy pretty quickly, it was way past her bed time and the yelling soon stopped leaving only the silence of the night to creep upon her. She couldn't be sure but she could have sworn that she saw a figure in red at the line to the woods. She thought it might be her mom, but the figure was gone as soon as she double checked. She decided that she should get inside anyway. Mommy could be mad if she was found outside this late after bedtime. She would double check in the morning.\\n\\nShe tiptoed around the living room. Their father and their uncle, had gotten out the adults only drinks and were staring at the floor. Everything smelt funny. She went to her room, only to find that her sister wasn't there. No biggie. Her sister was probably getting ready for bed. She went over to the bathroom but it was empty. Strange. She needed to find her sister, so they could go to bed, mommy wouldn't like it if they were still up at this hour. She walked the hallways, it was really quiet now, usually there was at least some noise going on. She didn't like it.\\n\\nShe eventually, found her sister up in their parents' room, curled under the covers, and sobbing. She didn't like it when her sister was upset, it made her feel bad. She was too short to climb up on her own, but she was smart. Mommy said so. Eventually, she managed to stack boxes to help her up. She crawled over to where her sister was hiding and got under the covers next to her. It felt weird being there without mommy or daddy, but she pushed the feeling away. Her sister was more important. And it smelt like mommy and daddy so that would have to do. She wiped away a tear from her sister's face with her thumb like mommy did whenever she cried. Her big sister pulled her into a hug and held her there really tight, like she was a stuffed bear. She didn't mind her sister's hugs, for the most part she loved them even when they were a bit too tight. What she didn't like about this hug was that her sister was crying into her hair which was kinda gross, but it was more that the reason for the hug was that her sister was upset. She didn't like that. Her sister was the brave and strong one, not her. If anyone was supposed to be crying, it should be her, not the other way around. That's just how it worked. Big sisters didn't cry, but then again neither do adults, but their daddy and uncle were breaking that rule too. They all must really miss mommy, but she did too. She was just the only one who believed mommy kept promises.\\n\\nShe supposed that just this once she can be the big sister. Or at least try, she was too small to play the part right, but she figured it didn't matter that much. She wrapped her arms around her sister and burrowed closer into the warmth. She closed her eyes and let the darkness carry her away to dreamland to wait for mommy. Everything would be okay in the morning. After all, mommy promised to be back. Once the week was over, they'd see.\\n\\nAN; and that's that. maybe next time I should consider doing something happier. puppies maybe. meh, que sera sera. either way, hope you liked this. please leave a review if you have time. ensia.\",\n",

       " 'Venezuela is stepping up efforts to combat shortages and rising places so families can have a merry Christmas complete with 12-cent sacks of sugar and 50-cent chickens.\\n\\nPresident Nicolas Maduro announced Friday that he is deploying hundreds of inspectors to enforce the government\\'s price regulations, which set the cost of everything from milk to toothbrushes artificially low.\\n\\n\"Today we deploy, and in November and December you will see that we have guaranteed a happy Christmas for the people,\" he said during televised remarks.\\n\\nThe move is part of expanded effort to combat chronic shortages, smuggling, and runaway inflation that are putting great stress on consumers in the socialist Latin American country. The new initiatives come as Maduro\\'s approval ratings have plunged into the low 30 percent range, and his party prepares for congressional elections next year.\\n\\nMaduro recently announced that his administration had taken over warehouses where \"bourgeois criminals\" were hoarding food and medical supplies. He also increased the maximum prison sentence for smugglers to 14 years.\\n\\nOfficials say the state has arrested more than 1,000 smugglers since Venezuela began closing its border with Colombia each night.\\n\\nThe administration blames shortages on black-market vendors who buy groceries at government-regulated prices and illegally resell them for high profits and on an \"economic war\" it says is being waged by hostile, speculating companies. Critics say the problems are the result of excessive government intervention in the economy and smuggling that is tacitly endorsed by security forces.\\n\\nThe new inspection team will be responsible for verifying that prices remain below government-issued caps at supermarkets as well as at stores selling shoes, toys, appliances and hardware, among other goods. Maduro promised to be \"relentless\" in tracking down and punishing violators.\\n\\nCaracas Chamber of Commerce head Victor Maldonado said the inspections will do little to right the distortions in the oil country\\'s economy and ensure happy holidays.\\n\\n\"There is a huge crisis of confidence in Venezuela,\" he said.

       " 'Balls have been raising puffs of dust, edges have sometimes failed to carry to the keeper, and only once in eight innings has 250 been surpassed, but although these are alien conditions, Australia have clinched the ODI series the \"Australian way\", according to the acting captain David Warner.\\n\\nThe victory in the fourth ODI was the visitor\\'s most comprehensive on tour, as they ran down Sri Lanka\\'s 212 with six wickets in hand and 19 overs remaining. Aaron Finch had set the chase off apace with a 18-ball fifty, which featured three sixes and eight fours. His share of a 5.3 over opening stand which yielded 74 runs, was 55. Warner was 18 off 14 balls at the other end, eventually making 19 from 16.\\n\\n\"It\\'s always awesome to have one of your players go off like that and for me it is more of a watching tour to be honest,\" Warner said. \"I\\'ve been up the other end or in the dug out watching the guys go about it. But it\\'s fantastic - I love that Finch comes out and plays his game. That\\'s how we play. That\\'s the Australian way. We have always played that way, and as I said to the guys today, you almost know what your role is. The first 10 overs was the new ball and we had to make the most of it.\\n\\nChandimal laments Mathews injury The injury to Angelo Mathews contributed significantly to Sri Lanka\\'s loss at Dambulla, acting captain Dinesh Chandimal said. Mathews had injured his right calf while batting in the 27th over of the innings, and retired hurt shortly after. Though he later returned to the crease, his running was significantly hampered, and he did not take the field. Mathews was one of two seam bowlers in Sri Lanka\\'s XI. \"Angelo is one of our major threats with the ball,\" Chandimal said. \"Without him it\\'s a major setback. He always gets us a wicket or two. He will have a CT scan tomorrow, but at the moment he looks unlikely to play in the rest of the tour.\" Chandimal also defended the selection of 18-year-old opening batsman Avishka Fernando, who had not played any senior cricket before this match, and was out second ball. \"Avishka has scored a lot of runs in the under-19 team, and was batting really well at training. Danushka Gunathilaka, whom he replaced, wasn\\'t batting that well.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s about getting a good start in these conditions and make use of that new ball when we\\'re batting, because otherwise you see what happens when the ball gets old - it starts turning square.\"\\n\\nGeorge Bailey top-scored for Australia for the second match in a row, converting Finch\\'s start into a win with a 85-ball 90 not out. He had again been impressive against Sri Lanka\\'s spinners, using his feet often, and using the sweep and reverse-sweep better than any Australia batsman has done on the tour.\\n\\n\"We had to learn to adapt,\" Warner said. \"Look at the way George Bailey came in and reversed and swept and backed his game plan. The way he has played in the subcontinent in the last couple of years, his form has been outstanding, and the way he finished it off today was superb.\"\\n\\nIt was Australia\\'s attack that perhaps played the more definitive role in the match, however, dismissing Sri Lanka for a total captain Dinesh Chandimal suggested was at least 40 runs below par. John Hastings was the visitors\\' major weapon, taking a career-best 6 for 45 to follow his 2 for 41 on Sunday. Hastings was especially successful through the middle overs.\\n\\n\"He\\'s been a very good bowler for a long time now and he\\'s a very cagey one - you have to respect him,\" Warner said of Hastings. \"I know when I\\'ve played against him in the past, he\\'s just so hard to get away. In these conditions he is very challenging to go after, and it showed tonight. His skills were fantastic and there\\'s probably a reason he got a personal best.\\n\\n\"The other string to his bow is that he can hit a long ball. We look around our team and our squad that we have had the last two years - we\\'ve got some very good allrounders in Australia. I think we\\'re in a very good paddock and that\\'s the fantastic thing about Australian cricket.\"\\n\\nAlthough his team has won the series, Warner was critical of the surfaces that have been prepared this series. He said he would rather see pitches like the one at Trent Bridge, on which England made a record 444 on Tuesday. Sri Lanka\\'s ODI venues have been consistently low-scoring over the past decade. A score of over 300 has never been successfully chased down on the island.\\n\\n\"It\\'s hard to gain momentum when the wickets prepared are like this,\" Warner said. \"I speak from an Australian cricketer\\'s point of view - we\\'re about growing the game. When it comes to one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket you like to see more of a contest where you\\'re scoring over 300 runs and you\\'re chasing down totals. Sitting back last night and watching England score 400, then coming out here, busting our backsides for both teams scramble to 200 - it\\'s probably not ideal for people coming out here to watch that kind of cricket.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a little bit disappointing from our point of view because it\\'s not the way we like to play. We like to play an aggressive brand of cricket. We like to entertain the crowd. So far, it\\'s been very difficult to try and do that. From the Sri Lankan spectators\\' point of view - for them I\\'d like to see fours and sixes and big hits. At the moment it\\'s probably not that way.\\n\\n\"When you see games like the England match last night - that\\'s what I love about cricket. I love that kind of atmosphere, and that\\'s why as a youngster I went to watch the game. But if you come here and you play five games like that, on wickets like they have here at the moment, it is going to be very, very tough to draw a big crowd all the time.\"',\n",

In early 2000, she stated plainly: \"I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman.\" She quickly clarified that she was strongly supportive of civil unions, but maintained her stance against same-sex marriage well into her term as senator.\\n\\nIn 2006, she told gay rights activists that she would support same-sex marriage if it was introduced in New York. However, she still expressed greater comfort with \"states making the decisions.\"\\n\\nThroughout the 2008 presidential campaign, Clinton remained opposed to same-sex marriage. She did come out and support repealing portions of the Defense of Marriage Act -- a law her husband signed in 1996 that prohibited same-sex couples from accessing certain benefits.\\n\\nIn 2011 Clinton declared, \"Gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights,\" and following her resignation in February 2013, she quickly came out in support of the growing marriage equality movement, saying LGBT Americans should be treated as \"full and equal citizens, and they deserve the rights of citizenship. That includes marriage.\"\\n\\nWhile Hillary Clinton has certainly warmed to the gay community during her political career, Bill Clinton\\'s implication that Hillary has supported gay rights throughout the years is false.\\n\\nEx-Attorney General Eric Holder\\n\\nReality Check: Eric Holder on crime and incarceration stats\\n\\nBy Sonam Vashi, CNN\\n\\nHolder ran through several statistics on the criminal justice system, and we\\'re going to unpack them, one by one.\\n\\n\"At a time when our justice system is out of balance, when one in three black men will be incarcerated in their lifetimes ...\"\\n\\nWe\\'ve looked at this claim before . This figure comes from the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice think tank, released a report in 2013 with this conclusion. However, that report, which was submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, was based on 2001 data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Since then, incarceration rates for black males have decreased by about 23% between 2001 and 2014.\\n\\nWhile the \"one in three\" figure may be outdated, it\\'s clear that black males have disproportionately high imprisonment rates -- ones that are 3.8 to 10.5 times higher for all ages than white males and 1.4 to 3.1 times higher than Hispanic males, according to the BJS. Holder\\'s claim is mostly true.\\n\\n\"And when black defendants in the federal system receive sentences 20% longer than their white peers, we need a president who will end this policy of over-incarceration.\"\\n\\ntrue, at least for black males, according to a 2013 report from the U.S. Sentencing Commission.

Between December 2007 and September 2011, federal judges gave sentences to black men that were 19.5% longer than those given to white men for similar crimes.\\n\\n\"Now, as attorney general, I launched sweeping reforms of our federal criminal justice system and reduced its reliance on draconian mandatory minimum sentences.\"\\n\\ntrue.

Holder is well-known for making criminal justice reform a central part of his tenure, and he saw mandatory minimum sentences, which set minimum binding prison terms for certain crimes, as a civil rights issue. In 2015, Holder touted that federal prosecutors sought mandatory minimum sentences less often after his reforms and bringing fewer prosecutions for illegal drugs.\\n\\n\"And as a result, we cut the federal prison population and the crime rate -- together -- for the first time in more than 40 years.\"\\n\\nThe FBI\\'s Uniform Crime Report measures violent crime, which includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. In 2014, the violent crime rate was the lowest it has been since it peaked in the 1990s.\\n\\nAnd in 2014, the federal prison population decreased for the first time since the 1970s, by 2%, according to numbers from the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\\n\\nHolder is correct in saying that both measures went down simultaneously for the first time in decades, but his statement is missing some context. Violent crime hit a small uptick last year, according to preliminary numbers from the FBI, and it\\'s on the rise so far this year, according to a midyear violent crime survey . Additionally, as we noted for a claim for President Barack Obama last week, the overall violent crime rate has been steadily declining since the 1990s.

While the 2014 decrease is notable, it doesn\\'t come close to reversing that larger trend (there were more than 214,000 inmates in federal prisons in 2014, 769% more than the 25,000 federal inmates in 1980).\\n\\nFor missing all of that context, Holder\\'s claim on the decrease in violent crime and incarceration is true, but misleading.\\n\\nEx-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright\\n\\nReality Check: Trump\\'s appreciation for dictators\\n\\nBy Sonam Vashi, CNN\\n\\nAlbright pondered Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\\'s statements on world leaders.\\n\\n\"Donald Trump also has a strange admiration for dictators -- Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin. When asked about Putin, Donald Trump said, and I quote, \\'In terms of leadership, he\\'s getting an A,\\'\" Albright said.\\n\\nTrump has said many things about many people, but Albright is taking his statements a bit out of context.\\n\\nEarlier this month , Trump commended Hussein\\'s killing of \"terrorists\" in Iraq -- but also said Hussein was a \"really bad guy.\"\\n\\n\"He was a bad guy -- really bad guy,\" Trump said. \"But you know what? He did well. He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn\\'t read them the rights. They didn\\'t talk. They were terrorists. Over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism.\"\\n\\nFor Kim, Trump said in January, \"You have to give him credit. How many young guys -- he was like 26 or 25 when his father died -- take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden -- you know, it\\'s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture and it\\'s a cultural thing, he goes in, he takes over, and he\\'s the boss. It\\'s incredible.\"\\n\\nBut Trump prefaced his statement by saying Kim was a \"maniac,\" and added that, \"We can\\'t play games with him. Because he really does have missiles. And he really does have nukes.\"\\n\\nAnd in September, Trump said of Putin , \"I think in terms of leadership, he\\'s getting an A.\" But that was when Putin and Obama met in New York. The rest of Trump\\'s quote read, \"and our president is not doing so well. They did not look good together.\" The quote was comparative to Obama and meant to be critical of the U.S. President.\\n\\nTrump clearly has a more flippant way of referring to world leaders than many politicians, but it is unfair for Albright to cite his statements without the proper context. Albright\\'s statement is true, but misleading.\\n\\nFormer Vermont Gov. Howard Dean\\n\\nReality Check: Dean on health insurance expansion\\n\\nBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoney\\n\\nDean, a doctor, praised the work Clinton and Obama did to expand health insurance coverage.\\n\\n\"When President Obama took office, he picked up the fight, and with the Affordable Care Act passed, we expanded insurance to 20 million more people. Today, 90% of Americans are covered and we have made so much progress,\" he said.\\n\\nMore than 90% of Americans have health insurance now. The number was 90.9% in 2015, according to the latest federal data.\\n\\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in May that 20 million people have insurance because of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. This includes those who obtained coverage on the Obamacare exchanges -- just more than 11 million people -- and from other provisions of the law, such as allowing children to stay on their parents\\' insurance until age 26.\\n\\nWe rate Dean\\'s statement true.\\n\\nReality Check: Mike Pence\\'s record\\n\\nBy Chip Grabow, CNN\\n\\nDean went after Trump\\'s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, criticizing him on several points.\\n\\nStarting with Pence\\'s record on health care, Dean said: \"Mike Pence voted against expanding the Children\\'s Health Insurance Program which Hillary helped to start. Mike Pence voted against requiring insurance companies to cover mental health and addiction treatment. Mike Pence voted to end Medicare as we know it.\"\\n\\nAn analysis of Pence\\'s voting record on each of these shows Pence did, in fact, vote against expanding the Children\\'s Health Insurance Program in January 2009. Pence also voted against a bill that would\\'ve required insurance companies to treat mental health and addiction treatments the same as they do physical benefits. And Pence did vote against a bill that would have overturned President George W. Bush\\'s veto of legislation that would have expanded Medicare coverage.\\n\\nDean also criticized Pence\\'s position on tobacco and cigarettes, saying: \"I hear Gov. Pence missed the memo, but they do, in fact, cause cancer and no amount of tobacco company contributions can change that, Governor.\" Dean was referring to an opinion piece Pence wrote in 2001 when tobacco legislation was being debated in Congress.\\n\\nPence wrote: \"Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\\'t kill. In fact, two out of every three smokers does not die from a smoking-related illness and nine out of 10 smokers do not contract lung cancer.\" As far back as 1964, the U.S. Surgeon General stated that \"smoking was a cause of human cancer and other diseases.\" Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says nine out of 10 lung cancers are caused by smoking cigarettes.\\n\\nAnd Dean\\'s reference to Pence accepting contributions from tobacco companies? According to the National Institute on Money in State Politics , Pence received a total of $75,000 from tobacco companies between 2009 and 2016.\\n\\nBased on the analysis on Pence\\'s voting record and data on contributions Pence received, we rate Dean\\'s claims true.\\n\\nCalifornia Sen. Barbara Boxer\\n\\nReality Check: Boxer on America\\'s standing under Clinton\\n\\nBy Ryan Browne, CNN\\n\\nBoxer praised Clinton\\'s 2009-2013 tenure as secretary of state during her speech at the DNC, crediting her with restoring America\\'s global popularity.\\n\\n\"We saw her strength, we saw, we saw her leadership when as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton restored America\\'s standing in the world. You remember that, after the Bush administration,\" Boxer said.\\n\\nBut Pew polls, comparing the favorability rating of the United States in 2008 versus the year Clinton stepped down in 2013, paint a very mixed picture.\\n\\nOf the 19 countries for which Pew has data , U.S. favorability improved in 13 countries. But the United States actually became less popular in six nations during that same period: China, Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, Poland and Lebanon.\\n\\nIt would also be difficult to attribute the change in favorability, either positive or negative, to Clinton alone, as the 2008 election of Obama is widely seen as helping to boost U.S. standing globally. Additionally, U.S. favorability improved even more in 11 of these countries in the years after Clinton left office.\\n\\nIt is impossible to attribute the changes to Clinton entirely, because American favorability actually improved in a majority of polled countries after she left office and the United States became less popular in six countries during her tenure. We rate Boxer\\'s claim false.\\n\\nNew York Sen. Charles Schumer\\n\\nReality Check: Clinton fighting to prevent NY factory closure\\n\\nBy Lisa Rose, CNN\\n\\nSchumer suggested Clinton single-handedly persuaded the executives at a nuclear engineering company to keep open their plant in Schenectady, New York, preventing local layoffs.\\n\\n\"Hillary listened to the factory worker at the Bechtel plant in Schenectady, worried sick that his company was leaving town,\" Schumer said. \"Hillary got tough. She read the corporate honchos the riot act until they agreed to keep their plant open, saving his job and many others.\"\\n\\nClinton was very active in lobbying Bechtel but Schumer overstated Clinton\\'s role. The campaign to help the workers was actually a group effort. Schumer himself lobbied Bechtel Plant Machinery management. So did Rep. Michael McNulty, Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Schenectady Mayor Brian Stratton. Eventually, they persuaded executives to keep the facility open but the compromise involved staff reductions. Bechtel agreed to keep 130 workers employed in Schenectady but another 130 jobs were cut through retirements and transfers to the company\\'s campus in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nSchumer\\'s claim that Clinton saved the plant is true, but misleading. She played a role in persuading the company to stay in Schenectady but she had help from other politicians, including Schumer himself.\\n\\nThere\\'s another asterisk: A year after the compromise was reached in 2007, a Bechtel spokesman said the company was still transferring jobs from Schenectady to Pennsylvania but the moves would occur \"over time,\" according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\\n\\nEx-NYPD Det. Joe Sweeney\\n\\nReality Check: Clinton\\'s record on 9/11 first responders\\n\\nBy Sonam Vashi, CNN\\n\\nSweeney focused on Clinton\\'s record caring for the 9/11 first responders. \"Within 48 hours of the towers falling, Hillary introduced a bill -- signed into law -- that helped first responders get the benefits they earned easier and faster,\" Sweeney said. \"Then, she pressured the (Environmental Protection Agency) to launch a new task force and led congressional hearings until the EPA admitted the air hadn\\'t been safe.\"\\n\\nTwo days after the 9/11 attacks, then-New York Sen. Clinton introduced a bill that expedited payments of benefits to public safety officers killed or severely injured in the terrorist attacks. The bill was unanimously passed on the same day and became law on November 18, 2001.\\n\\nClinton also led criticism of the EPA for its reassurance about the air quality near the World Trade Center after the attacks, when it was later found that hazardous toxins were released by the towers\\' destruction.\\n\\nFive months after the attacks, Clinton and Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman held hearings in New York to examine the possible health hazards from the dust at the disaster site. Clinton and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg organized efforts to address public complaints about environmental issues around ground zero, and Clinton pressured the EPA to join the task force.\\n\\nSoon after, it became clear that the EPA had downplayed the risks of the air quality around the World Trade Center just after the 9/11 attacks.\\n\\nClinton clearly pursued care for her constituents affected by the 9/11 attacks, so Sweeney\\'s statement is true.\\n\\nNew York Rep. Joseph Crowley\\n\\nReality Check: Trump profiting off 9/11\\n\\nBy Kate Grise, CNN\\n\\nCrowley accused Trump of profiting after 9/11 rather than stepping up to help those affected by the terror attacks.\\n\\n\"Where was Donald Trump in the days and months and years after 9/11?\" he asked. \"He didn\\'t stand at the pile. He didn\\'t lobby Congress for help. He didn\\'t fight for the first responders. Nope. He cashed in. Collecting $150,000 in federal funds intended to help small businesses recover -- even though days after the attack Trump said his properties were not affected.\"\\n\\nDid Trump really take money earmarked for small businesses?\\n\\nAccording to a 2006 investigation by the New York Daily News, 40 Wall Street LLC, a Trump-owned business, collected a $150,000 grant to cover losses.\\n\\nAfter 9/11, the Empire State Development Corporation, awarded more than $550 million to businesses with fewer than 500 employees through the Business Recovery Grant program. The ESDC did not use annual revenue to determine small-business status as the federal government generally does.\\n\\nThe New York Daily News\\' review of ESDC records showed that 40 Wall Street LLC, through which Trump owns the building at that address in New York, reported having 28 employees and $26.8 million in annual revenue on the grant application.\\n\\nIn an April statement to Time magazine addressing the small-business grant he received, Trump said, \"It was probably a reimbursement for the fact that I allowed people, for many months, to stay in the building, use the building and store things in the building. I was happy to do it and to this day I am still being thanked for the many people I helped. The value of what I did was far greater than the money talked about, much of which was sent automatically to building owners in the area.\"\\n\\nIn an interview with a German TV reporter at ground zero a couple of days after the attacks, Trump said he had a couple of hundred men heading to help with cleanup efforts and that he had been down to the site himself, despite Crowley claiming that Trump never went to \"stand at the pile.\"\\n\\nTrump said during a primary debate this election season that he did indeed visit the site.\\n\\n\"Thousands of people killed and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup probably in the history of doing this. I\\'m in construction. I was down there, and I\\'ve never seen anything like it,\" Trump said.\\n\\nTrump has referenced going to ground zero after the attacks in other interviews as well.\\n\\nTrump\\'s role in lobbying Congress or fighting for first responders after 9/11 is unclear, but during the Republican National Convention last week, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Trump often helped \"when police officers were hot, when firefighters were hurt, when people were in trouble, he came forward and he helped, and he asked not to be mentioned.\"\\n\\nPhilip Kirschner, a 9/11 first responder, told Breitbart News in May that he believes Trump was behind the flight that transported him from Florida to the Cleveland Clinic when his health was declining in 2011.\\n\\nWe rate Crowley\\'s claim that Trump received a $150,000 grant earmarked for small businesses recovering from 9/11 as true. We rate his claim that Trump was nowhere to be found post-9/11 as false, because Trump said at the time he visited ground zero and Giuliani has said Trump helped \"every time New York City suffered a tragedy.\"\\n\\nNew York Rep. Nydia Velazquez\\n\\nReality Check: Velazquez on female-owned businesses\\n\\nBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoney\\n\\nOn the historic day when Clinton became the first female presidential nominee of a major party, Velazquez hailed America\\'s female entrepreneurs.\\n\\n\"Women-owned and women-operated small businesses are the fastest growing group of entrepreneurs in America today,\" Velazquez said.\\n\\nWomen are creating new firms at a rapid clip. Between 2002 and 2012, the number of female-owned businesses grew at a rate 2.5 times the national average, while employment in female-owned companies increased at a rate 4.5 times that of all firms, according to the most recent statistics available from the National Women\\'s Business Council, a federal advisory council.\\n\\nThe rate of growth for female-owned businesses is almost four times the rate of male-owned companies.\\n\\nThe number of businesses owned by women of color has been soaring. In 2002, there were fewer than 1 million minority female-owned firms, or 14% of female-owned firms. A decade later, there were nearly 3.8 million firms or 38% of female-owned businesses.\\n\\nOver that decade, non-minority female-owned firms grew by 9% in number, while minority female-owned business increased by 315%.\\n\\nAn annual report conducted by American Express backs up these statistics. Between 2007 and 2016, the number of female-owned firms has grown at a rate five times faster than the national average, according to the 2016 State of Women-Owned Businesses Report.\\n\\nSo we rate Velazquez\\' statement as true.\\n\\nMassachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark\\n\\nReality Check: Clark on gun violence\\n\\nBy Chip Grabow, CNN\\n\\nIn remarks supporting Clinton, Clark spoke to Clinton\\'s ability to take on special interests, including what she called \"the big-money gun lobby.\"\\n\\nClark cited a statistic that \"91 Americans are killed by gun violence every day.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2010 and 2014 (the latest year for which the CDC has data), an average of 32,964 people were killed by firearms each of those years. That equates to about 90 people killed by a firearm each day.\\n\\nHowever, that average includes suicides, unintentional deaths and incidents with undetermined intent as well as violence-related firearm deaths (homicide and legal intervention). In 2014, 11,409 people were killed in gun violence-related deaths by homicide or legal intervention. The CDC reports 586 unintentional deaths by firearms that year, and they also report 270 deaths where the intent was undetermined.\\n\\nSuicides in 2014 accounted for almost two-thirds of the deaths by firearms.\\n\\nSo, more than 90 people did die each day on average in 2014 from a firearm injury, not all of those deaths were what the CDC classified as \"violence-related.\"\\n\\nVerdict: True, but misleading.\\n\\nFormer Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin\\n\\nReality Check: Harkin on disability employment\\n\\nBy Ali Foreman, CNN\\n\\nWhen the Americans with Disabilities Act passed the Senate, Harkin spoke loudly -- without saying a word. The Iowa senator famously delivered his 1990 floor speech on inclusivity and discrimination in American Sign Language. During the second night of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, an audience of delegates and spectators signed along with him. Harkin taught the crowd how to sign \"America\" while drawing attention to a continued lack of employment for disabled Americans.\\n\\nHarkin praised the 1990 act\\'s successes, but noted its failings, saying, \"When, 26 years later, 70% of adults with disabilities in America aren\\'t in the workforce, it\\'s time to take action.\"\\n\\nThe Department of Labor confirms that Harkin\\'s claim about employment disparity for the disabled is true. However, his 70% statistic is low. In the month of June, nearly 80% of all disabled Americans did not participate in the workforce. This percentage is noticeably high, particularly when compared to the 31% of non-disabled Americans who last month weren\\'t part of the workforce.\\n\\nSince 1991, disabled Americans have seen a sharp decline in labor force participation and employment. Analysts attribute this slip, in part, to an aging population. However, discrimination still plays a role in employment for the disabled. Data from the 2010 Census show an increasing wage gap for disabled workers, who on average get paid $9,000 less annually than their non-disabled coworkers.\\n\\nWe rate Harkin\\'s claim as true but note that the 70% of disabled Americans out of the workforce that he cited should be upped to 80%.',\n",

       " \"You'd hardly say that the horror theme running through this series of Doctor Who has been an undercurrent, but in Mummy On The Orient Express, it bubbles right to the fore. As the Doctor tells us early on, there are many trains that have taken the name the Orient Express, but there's only one in space. And that's where we find ourselves for the vast bulk of the episode. It just happens to be the one where a Mummy is wreaking havoc.\\n\\nPenned by Jamie Mathieson, making his Doctor Who debut, Mummy On The Orient Express thus mixes in solid ingredients. There's an Agatha Christie-esque mystery, with a bunch of passengers who get drawn into what's going on. It also has a play with the Universal horror movies of old - as does director Paul Wilmshurst, who we're coming to shortly - with the Mummy itself a really convincing and impressive creation. And it chucks in Frank Skinner, playing, well, Frank Skinner in a hat, for good measure. There's a song from Foxes at the start too, for people who like songs from Foxes.\\n\\nIf it sounds like eclectic ingredients we get here, then somewhat inevitably it's a bit of an eclectic episode. It doesn't quite mash together perfectly, but you're a long way from being shortchanged. There's certainly a little dab of Voyage Of The Damned about it, but it's the central conundrum of the Mummy, what it's doing, when it's doing it and why it's doing it that remains the thrust of the episode. Time is important, too.\\n\\nWhat's disappointing - and we're treading enormously carefully to ensure we give nothing away (you can look for subtexts here as much as you like, but you won't find them) - is that it doesn't quite pick up the ramifications of the brilliant, yet divisive, Kill The Moon in the way it might have done. We're at the two-thirds stage of the series right now, but there's no sense that Doctor Who is coming in for its landing. That's not a fault of the contained story within this episode, we should note. In fact, there's an argument it's not much of a fault at all. Yet it's an inevitable reaction to the episode, after what happened last week.\\n\\nThat said, where Mummy On The Orient Express works is as a good, mainly standalone episode of Doctor Who. It's one that could have easily sat earlier in the run as here quite happily enough, but that's no problem. Capaldi holds this one together, and the main guest star, the aforementioned Skinner, isn't likely to trouble the BAFTAs, but is clearly part of the fun.\\n\\nOne person who should trouble the BAFTAs though is Paul Wilmshurst. Doctor Who series 8 hasn't been shy of very strong directors, but his work in this episode and Kill The Moon is of real merit. Mark him as a name to watch, because all the signs are there that he has a good feature or two in his future. More from him in Who as well please.\\n\\nWe'd like more from Jamie Mathieson too. He keeps his story contained, cares about what he's referencing, and puts together a good, solid 45 minute horror puzzle. At times not out of place in Russell T Davies' era of the show, Mummy On The Orient Express occasionally chugs, but still works perfectly well. Capaldi also remains one of the best casting decisions Doctor Who has made in some time.\\n\\nFollow our Twitter feed for faster news and bad jokes right here. And be our Facebook chum here.\",\n",

I don’t know... I don’t know anything about that.”Israel’s 2016 NGO law requires nonprofit organizations that receive more than half of their funding from foreign governments to report this fact each year to the registrar in the Justice Ministry.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this month he wants to make the NGO transparency law stricter. Critics view the current NGO law as an infringement on civil liberties.Bundestag deputies slammed Schäfer’s anti-Israel statements, the Bild reported.Lawmaker Thomas Feist of the Christian Democratic Union said likening Israel to China and Russia is “divorced from reality,” and the comparison “is damaging for the bilateral relationship between Germany and Israel.”Jürgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for the CDU/CSU parties in the Bundestag, said: “Such a comparison is insensitive.We should make it unambiguously clear who Germany’s partners and allies are – the free democratic, constitutional states.And, without question, Israel and Hungary belong to those states, not China and today’s Russia.”Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who is a Social Democrat, has faced criticism for an increased hostility toward Israel. He has previously called Israel an “apartheid regime” and last month hosted an Iranian cleric who called for Israel’s destruction.Gabriel declined to meet Netanyahu’s request to cancel meetings during his recent visit to Israel with two NGOs critical of the government.

He further added that they were upgrading their systems and equipment so that they could meet standards as per the industry.\\n\\nThe spokesperson continued further by saying that they regularly support their customers despite the fact that all happened due to technology, this support is associated with advice and updates such as giving them chances of upgrading to Hub 3.0 which had a stronger security.\\n\\nThe research was conducted on popular smart gadgets and devices such as Bluetooth toys, smart padlocks, and wireless cameras. Some of these devices appeared difficult to hack, unlike others. Among the 15 tested devices, 8 were found to have at least one security flaw.

There are always people who hate. Maybe he is a former athlete who failed, or maybe he’s just jealous. But this man has made a big mistake. He had one life before making this statement, and he will have a different life after it. He is spreading falsehoods.\\n\\n“Doping at Juventus was over when Zlatan arrived.

All the clubs Zlatan has been at know he doesn’t even take aspirin.”\\n\\nKarlsson, who said he had no evidence against Ibrahimovic, stood by the claim when approached by Expressen, saying he had been speaking at a conference discussing “how widespread doping is … And Zlatan increased weight very quickly [at Juventus].

But the service is not releasing the information in this instance because “this has been designated a ‘National Security Case’,” a Navy official told USNI News on Friday.\\n\\n“A ‘National Security Case ’ is one which: to any serious degree, involves the compromise of a military or defense advantage over any foreign nation or terrorist group; involves an allegation of willful compromise of classified information, affects our military or defense capability to successfully resist hostile or destructive action, overt or covert; or involves an act of terrorism,” according to a manual of trying classified military cases.\\n\\nThe cases are tried under an additional set of rules than normal courts-martial due to the sensitivity of the evidence involved in the proceedings.\\n\\nWhen contacted by USNI News, U.S. Fleet Forces spokesman Capt. Jack Hanzlik did neither release the name of the officer nor any other details of the case.\\n\\nAnother Navy official told USNI News, “NCIS and FBI are still investigating the details of this case and therefore we cannot provide any additional details at this time.”\\n\\nThough heavily redacted — without dates or locations — the charging document spins a narrative in which the accused allegedly transported secret information out of the country without permission and then lied about his whereabouts when he returned to duty. The charging documents allege the O-4 successfully committed espionage twice and attempted espionage on three other occasions.\\n\\nService officials also did not specify the country to which to which the officer passed along the secrets or to which he traveled.\\n\\n“I could not tell you out of respect for the ongoing investigation,” the official said.\\n\\nIn addition to the accusations related to transmitting secrets to a foreign power, the officer was also accused of violating military law by patronizing prostitutes and committing adultery.\\n\\nThe lieutenant commander is currently in pre-trial confinement at the Naval Consolidated Brig Chesapeake, Va. and is currently assigned to commander, Patrol and Reconnaissance Group, according to the service.\\n\\nMaritime surveillance is an increasingly important national naval asset as potential U.S. adversaries like Russia and China have grown in military strength and sophistication.\\n\\nIn the last several years the U.S. has introduced several new aerial surveillance platforms, notably the Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft and the unmanned Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton long-range surveillance aircraft. Both aircraft are key to the U.S. military rebalance to the Western Pacific.\\n\\nThe last major incident of espionage by an active duty member of the Navy was the case of John Walker – a Navy warrant officer and submariner who for 18 years passed reams of military secrets to the Soviet Union before he was finally caught in 1985.',\n",

Yet there was still a “shame” clinging to the entire debate.\\n\\nWe have to break that shame and stigma attached to addiction and to those who were making a “heroic” recovery and effort to “re-brick” their lives, he said.\\n\\nMr Ó Riordáin said achieving better outcomes for those in treatment was vital if we were to improve their quality of life.\\n\\n“Every recovering drug user should have a care plan, which provides a definite framework for addressing their needs. This means all the agencies working together with a common vision on recovery,” he said.\\n\\nThe new drugs strategy would provide an opportunity for Government departments and agencies, the community and voluntary sector and elected representatives to “re-commit to the partnership approach which has been the cornerstone of our drugs policy up to now”.\\n\\nThe Minister announced the appointment of John Carr as the independent chairman of the steering group which will oversee the development of the new strategy.\\n\\nAddressing the conference, President Michael D Higgins said so many problems, including drug addiction and the effects of climate change, fall “most heavily and first” on those in society with the least capacity to deal with them.\\n\\nMr Higgins said there could be very few people in Ireland today whose lives had not been touched by addiction in some form or other.\\n\\n“It is estimated that for every individual directly affected by addiction, at least eight other people’s lives are affected, including partners, children, parents, grandparents, siblings, colleagues and friends,” he said.\\n\\n“The abuse of drugs and other substances continues to contribute to a wide range of health, social and behavioural problems across a wide spectrum of Irish society but we are, thankfully, moving towards working with those affected by drugs misuse with the respect and compassion they deserve.”\\n\\nThe conference, entitled Our Communities, Our World - A Drugs Policy that Works, marks the 20th anniversary of the Dublin-based organisation Citywide.\\n\\nMr Higgins noted the beginnings of Citywide were “rooted in a Dublin where drug taking had entered the lives of a second generation of young Irish people, and where a heroin epidemic was infiltrating and destroying many disadvantaged and marginalised communities”.\\n\\n‘Health challenge’\\n\\n“The transmission of AIDS and Hepatitis C was presenting an increasing public health challenge, while the growing availability of cocaine, ecstasy and other drugs was putting more young people at risk.”\\n\\nTwo decades on, the situation remained challenging. He said a report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction last year found that the rate of drug-induced deaths in Ireland in 2011 was the third highest in Europe and four times the EU rate.\\n\\nIt also found that, while heroin and cocaine related deaths had decreased, non-heroin opiate-related deaths involving substances such as methadone, codeine and other prescription opiates had increased.\\n\\n“These are worrying facts and, behind the stark figures and statistics lie the many lives ruined, futures lost, and families ruptured by harmful drug use,” the President said.\\n\\n“There are also the many sad and individual stories of those whose potential and possibilities have been diminished through their addiction to drugs; stories of mistakes and regret, of lost opportunities and vanishing hopes, of the hurts they have inflicted on others and that have been inflicted upon them.”\\n\\nHe said a main theme of his presidency had been to build “an inclusive Republic - one in which all citizens are treated with equal dignity and respect and are empowered to participate in our democracy”.\\n\\n“As a society we have made progress in realising equality for many groups - for example through the marriage equality referendum earlier this year; but discrimination, marginalisation, and stigmatisation persist. If we are to achieve the goal of a true Republic and give expression to the vision of universal human rights, then we must seek out and embrace those of our fellow citizens who are most vulnerable and suffer the greatest exclusion,” he said.\\n\\nThe President said drug users and those affected by addiction were often in a position of exclusion and denial of citizenship.\\n\\nHe said: “They are often regarded as being outside or even below the community of rights-holders in our society. Their addiction - a medical and social condition which causes them suffering and impairment - is used as a basis to dehumanise drug users.\\n\\n“That dehumanisation takes the form of stigmatisation and derogatory language; and it leads to a denial of services, a lack of voice, and even, on occasion, is used as a justification for victimisation.”',\n",

A so-called critical mass of inhabitants was needed to attract the services, businesses and restaurants required to liven up the downtown core, particularly on evenings and weekends.\\n\\nAs part of the 1997 downtown plan, the city offered developers an incentive of $4,500 for each of the first thousand residential units created in the area.\\n\\nSoon, a number of historic warehouses along the street were converted to trendy loft-style condominiums such as the Cobogo, Excelsior and Phillips Lofts.\\n\\nBarry Kaiser bought a condo in the Phillips Lofts upon returning to his native Edmonton in 2002, after 18 years of living in Bermuda, Guatemala and Boston.\\n\\nKaiser, who once lived in a renovated piano factory, was attracted to the historical aesthetic of the building, which once was earmarked for the wrecking ball.\\n\\nBut still, the Cecil Hotel cast an unsavoury shadow over the street.\\n\\n\"From about 11 o’clock at night to about six in the morning, it was a different street,\" he recalled.\\n\\nThe closure of the Cecil Hotel in January 2003 is seen by many as the single most important moment in the street’s modern history.\\n\\nYears of neglect finally prompted city inspectors to cite the property for health violations.\\n\\nWhen the doors closed, the patrons who caused so much trouble moved on, and a real estate lawyer turned developer stepped in to buy the property.\\n\\nThe tipping point\\n\\nShortly after Cecil’s demise, however, residents in the area had a new fight to wage.\\n\\nPlans for the new Century Condominium and a proposal to move the Baccarat Casino to 104th Street and 104 Avenue convinced residents that if they didn’t take action, the flavour of the street would be lost forever.\\n\\n\"Here, you’ve got probably the most beautiful street in downtown Edmonton and you’re going to put a casino at the end of it,\" Kaiser remembered thinking.\\n\\nKaiser banded together with other residents to fight the proposals. The group created a website, attended city council meetings and hung banners outside the lofts which read \"Save our Street.\"\\n\\nThe efforts paid off. In early 2004, council defeated the Baccarat Casino development by a 7-6 margin.\\n\\nShortly afterwards, with the help of Kaiser and others on the street, the city enacted new design guidelines that would compel new developments to reflect the historical elements of the warehouse district.\\n\\n\"There was a realization that we had a community downtown,\" said Kaiser.\\n\\n\"It was a crystallization moment and really that casino win, everything since has been going in the right direction.\"\\n\\nEnter John Day\\n\\nWhenever people in Edmonton talk about successful urban developments, John Day’s name inevitably comes up.\\n\\nDay is well known in the city as one of the developers behind the construction of a new building on the northeast corner of Whyte Avenue and Calgary trail, the renovation of the Garneau Theatre and the upcoming remake of the Kelly-Ramsay building on Rice Howard Way.\\n\\nDeveloper John Day bought the Cecil Hotel in 2003, eventually replacing it with a building that complements the historical elements of 104th Street. (CBC)\\n\\nFive months after the Cecil closed its doors, Day and a partner purchased the property and demolished the hotel, destroying the street’s final link to its seedy past.\\n\\n\"When people saw the Cecil Place hotel come down, they thought, gee, maybe this isn’t going to be such a dangerous, scary place around here anymore,\" Day said.\\n\\n\"I think people started to feel more positive about it.\"\\n\\nThinking the street could benefit from the addition of a grocery store, Day convinced Sobey’s to sign on with one of their new urban concept stores, which opened in May 2008.\\n\\nThe building is now fully leased but Day says starting construction with only one tenant was risky.\\n\\n\"It was two-thirds built on spec. I’m not sure I want to do that again,\" he said.\\n\\n\"As I drive by other people’s buildings that were vacant, I’m thinking, boy, what were you thinking in doing this? But it ultimately worked out.\"\\n\\nCritical mass\\n\\nAround the same time Day’s architects were pouring over blueprints, Reza Mostashari was looking to acquire the parking lot on the west side of 104th Street, between the Cecil and the Century condominium.\\n\\nThe young president of Langham Developments had just finished his Omega Condominium on 99th Avenue and 105th Street and was looking for a new project.\\n\\nSitting in the 30th floor show suite of Icon II earlier this month, Mostashari said he was drawn to the historical feel of the street.\\n\\n\"I knew the city was really pushing to urge development in downtown, bring people in downtown,\" he said.\\n\\n\"And I like sites like this because you have a lot of latitude to design something that’s interesting, unique, with some good looks, architectural merit.\"\\n\\nReza Mostashari, the president of Langham Developments, stands on the balcony of a penthouse on the 35th floor of the Icon II Tower. (CBC)\\n\\nMostashari bought the land in mid-2005 and decided to go with a two-tower concept to maximize the density of the site.\\n\\nThe 30-storey Icon I was completed in 2009, the second tower, five stories higher, was finished in 2010.\\n\\nToday, the two towers rise from a base of street-fronting stores, built to reflect the architecture of the older surrounding buildings.\\n\\nWhile it was initially difficult to meet rigorous design standards in the historic area, Mostashari says the task was soon manageable.\\n\\n\"Once we looked at it, it actually made sense,\" he said. \"To be honest with you, I think it was a good thing for us.\"\\n\\nMore changes in store\\n\\nThe 104th Street development has taken on new momentum in the past few years.\\n\\nAfter moving to the street in May 2004, the now-popular downtown farmers market has expanded to cover two blocks.\\n\\nThe Blue Plate Diner and Devine Wines -- two of the earliest businesses to take a chance on the street -- have now been joined by a bubble tea shop, an Irish pub, a high-end menswear store, several wine bars and a retailer specializing in gourmet olive oils and balsamic vinegars. Almost all are independent and local.\\n\\nAnd more changes are in store for downtown.\\n\\nThe old post office on 104th Avenue west of 97th Street will be soon be torn down to make way for the new Royal Alberta Museum.\\n\\nJohn Day’s Kelly-Ramsey project is raising hopes that Rice Howard Way can reach its potential as a pedestrian-centred magnet in the centre of downtown.\\n\\nAnd of course, the new arena has sparked hopes for a new entertainment district.\\n\\nAlso on the radar are projects covered by the Community Revitalization Levy (CRL), which could have a profound impact on downtown.\\n\\nDeveloper incentives were successful in bringing residents to the 104th Street lofts and similar measure is proposed under the arena CRL.\\n\\nThe arena CRL proposes a $12 million incentive program that would give developers $12,000 grants for the first 1,000 housing units in the area, with 10 per cent built to accommodate families.\\n\\nHowever, the incentive is not recommended in the initial phases of funding, and Coun. Ben Henderson believes downtown development may have reached a point where that kind of measure may no longer be needed.\\n\\nInstead, Henderson suggests improved sewer and water lines may have a greater impact.\\n\\nHenderson also thinks a proposed park at 105th Street and 102nd Avenue could serve as an important hub for family-friendly developments and prevent people from leaving downtown once they have kids.\\n\\n\"We’ve known from other cities there’s ways to create really kind of exciting opportunities as well that are not suburban for those people when they do have families,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I think that’s going to be the next big trick that we have to pull off.\"',\n",
       " 'Every day, adult video super-aggregator PornHub recommends a dozen or so scenes to those who visit its homepage. They typically go something like this (or involve some variation thereof): A naughty schoolgirl is seduced by her teacher (for misbehaving, naturally); a couple of straight girls are seduced by each other (for the first time ever); and/or a stepmother seduces her step-daughter (for some impromptu fauxcest).\\n\\nAll of this girl-on-girl action isn’t merely anecdotal either. In its annual January data dump, PornHub reported that once again, “lesbian” was the top search term of 2016, beating out “MILF,” “threesome” and even “teen.” The same was true in 2015. And almost true in 2014, when it fell a spot to the second most searched term of the year.\\n\\nThe “why” probably seems obvious: Two women are better than one, four breasts are better than two, etc. The lack of another male in the picture also means there’s no sense of competition. And of course, watching two women together plays directly into the ever-present male fantasy of being at the center of a threesome. But the experts say it’s more nuanced than that — i.e., unlike boy-girl scenes, girl-girl scenes stir the male libido not because of their sheer body-part count, but because they tend to linger on subtle movements like understated writhing or finely drawn o-faces.\\n\\nAdditionally, many men of a certain generation — let’s call it the Howard Stern Generation — came of age at a time when two women making out or having sex was becoming both ubiquitous and mainstream. They may have heard it referenced on the Stern show, seen it in clandestine copies of Hustler or Penthouse or watched it in movies (see: Wild Things, Cruel Intentions and Showgirls) right as their hormones were kicking in, full force.\\n\\nAll of which makes lesbian porn kinda quaint, especially in a modern porn era filled with extreme feats of face-fucking, anal sex and double penetration. “Porn is inching its way into being socially acknowledged,” says Bree Mills, an award-winning director and producer at Girlsway Films, which specializes in lesbian content. “Not necessarily acceptable, but fewer and fewer people are saying ‘I never watch porn.’ [Lesbian] is one of the most common entry points for people who are curious. They might not want to say, ‘Hey, I’m into Gaping Anal Princesses 4,’ but they might say, ‘Yeah, I like the pretty artistic erotic scene with these young female lovers.’”\\n\\n“Pretty artistic erotic scenes” are also all about lingering kisses and more body-to-body contact. Plus, performers’ faces tend to be shown more frequently during the act, which, if they’re doing their job, are conveying pleasure. (Same goes for the sounds they’re making.) These details are what actually turn men on, says Shannon Chavez, a clinical psychologist and certified sex therapist — not the prevailing wisdom that they only want to see gynecological-like closeups and hardcore P-to-V pounding.\\n\\n“Biologically, men’s sex response is wired to focus on what I call micro-expressions — a smile, a moan, a slight body movement,” she says. “That’s why it’s important to them to make a woman orgasm during sex. If a woman is enjoying it, the man is going to have a heightened arousal. His body is going to respond more.”\\n\\nThis factors into a guy’s porn preference through a highly intricate neurological process known as pairing. The first time a person experiences sexual arousal—whether from porn, a glimpse of flesh or something more abstract — that experience becomes lodged in their brain and associated, in one way or another, with their sexual desires.\\n\\nThat’s not to say that those connections are always — or ever — straightforward. “It’s not A+B=C,” says Cindy Michel, a psychotherapist who specializes in sex therapy. “It varies. For some men it might be, ‘I remember getting hard looking at this girl doing this,’ or ‘I remember watching two women together and something about it piqued my interest.’”\\n\\n“I call it the arousal template,” Chavez adds. “It’s any emotion that stirs you. If we’ve been programmed to think something is wrong or naughty, that can be arousing. That can spark your whole sexual response.”\\n\\nWhich brings us back to Howard Stern and his painstaking descriptions of two women kissing in his studio as well as Wild Things and Cruel Intentions, where Denise Richards and Neve Campbell and Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair spent more time kissing each other than their male co-stars. Not to mention Jennifer Connelly and Kristy Swanson in Higher Learning; Gina Gershon and Elizabeth Berkley in Showgirls; Gina Gershon (again!) and Jennifer Tilly in Bound; Willow and Tara in Buffy the Vampire Slayer; Liv Tyler and Alicia Silverstone in Aerosmith’s Crazy; Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy; Britney and Madonna; Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis in Black Swan, Santana and Brittany in Glee.\\n\\nIf that’s not pairing in the making, what is?\\n\\nThe somewhat amusing irony of girl-girl’s popularity among the modern straight male, however, is that even as real lesbianism has become an accepted part of mainstream consciousness, most porn scenes still depict straight male fantasies rather than actual lesbian sex.\\n\\nTo begin with, women performing in mainstream lesbian scenes tend to look more like imaginary archetypes: long hair, big breasts, small waists, fake nails. “There are very few girls who have gone out of their way to look like a male fantasy that identify as lesbians,” says director, producer and actress Lily Cade, who calls herself “Porn Valley’s Gold Star Lesbian.”\\n\\nStraight women performing lesbian sex also often don’t look that into it — something female viewers tend to notice more than male viewers. “The difference between men and women is, I can get around the physical, but they can get around the emotional,” says Cade. “I will have a bad time if the girl is gorgeous but not really into it, whereas if a girl is [gorgeous but] unhappy, guys can get it up anyway. It’s harder for them if a girl isn’t attractive.”\\n\\n“I don’t know if you can say the female gaze looks different,” she continues, “but it definitely feels different.”\\n\\nAbove all, the lesbian sex positions men favor are more fantasy than reality. Obviously, there’s no one way that women have sex with each other, just like there’s no one way hetero couples or gay men have sex with each other. In fact, there are as many ways for lesbians to have sex as there are lesbians in the world. But some things still stand out. For instance, Cade says, scissoring makes an appearance in mainstream lesbian porn much more than it tends to IRL. “I’ve had girlfriends who like to grind — that’s a real sex act — but it’s rare,” she says.\\n\\nOverall, lesbian porn for lesbians is less focused on body parts and sex acts than it is on relationships and specific scenarios. “We create this universe with characters, like what you would see on a mainstream soap opera,” says Mills of Girlsway Films. “When I’m producing, I’m thinking, How can I create a story with different dynamics and cast performers that really enjoy performing with other women?”\\n\\n“Women are often looking for the type of thing that’s happening,” adds Cade. “Like, the woman is going to want to see office exploitation sex [for example], and is less likely to be just a fan of big butts jiggling.”\\n\\nWomen who identify as lesbians also want to see people onscreen who look like their peer group. Cade points to examples like the queer porn site CrashPadSeries.com, which features performers who “a lesbian could see and be like, ‘This could be my fantasy girlfriend.’”\\n\\nErika Lust, a director who was among the first women to create what’s now known as feminist porn, accomplishes this by careful casting and incorporating as much realism as possible into her scenes. “What you find with the majority of porn is that there’s a disconnect from reality,” she explains. “When I film lesbian scenes, the focus isn’t on the fact that they’re lesbians, it’s on the good sex they’re having. I direct them from my female perspective, and I explore female sexual wants and represent female sexual desire and pleasure.”\\n\\nAs far as why straight men might be satisfied with porn that’s more performative than real, Cade suggests — somewhat jokingly — that it might have to do with their level of discernment. “What I discovered is that men aren’t that picky,” she says. “I don’t want to be offensive, but they’re not. They’re satisfied with the terrible porn that’s out there. All you need to do is have, like, attractive women.”\\n\\nEven so, she believes that most people do want to see real sex in which both partners are enjoying themselves. The catch is that when it comes to two women being together, most hetero men have never borne witness. “I think everyone is looking for it be real,” says Cade, “they just don’t necessarily know what real is.”\\n\\nThen again, the fact that straight men are so easily pleased is in many ways a win-win for Cade. “Women don’t buy porn in anywhere near the volume that men buy it,” she says. “So when my work reaches the audience I made it for, I describe it as, I took straight men’s money and made subversive lesbian porn with it.”',\n",

Now the duo plan on building on what they’ve achieved with their own brand.\\n\\nIntended to be a vehicle for a variety of artists and not just exclusively The Prototypes, Get Hype is set to develop in the coming months. As with everything they’ve done since exploding into the scene with Cascade six years ago, they’re doing things their own way by their own rules… They’ll be giving away MP3s of all releases and proceeds made through other means will go directly to the artists to support them making music in the future.\\n\\nThe first release will drop on July 1. We get the feeling it might be called Rocket Gunz Blazin’ but we might be wrong. Read on and get hyped yourselves….\\n\\nWhy now?\\n\\n\\n\\nChris: The time feels right. Starting a record label and being in charge of our own music is something we’ve always wanted and now it just feels like we could go out on our own and actually make it happen, We also have an amazing team of people around us right now that all believe also. It’s a special time.\\n\\nNick: Yeah we’ve been signed exclusively twice now and we feel like it’s time that we were in total control of everything we do… The way music is right now I feel you will see this from a lot of other artists also. We’ve got a clear vision of where we believe the label can go and what it can achieve. We’ve never felt so ambitious and determined to make it work.\\n\\nHow does this affect your releases on Viper?\\n\\nChris: We are still apart of the family, they are a great label and have helped us massively over the last two years and we respect that. Ultimately, we just want total control and total freedom over our creativity.\\n\\nNick: Viper saved us when things weren’t going so well for us in 2013 and bought us back in to the scene really. We will always be affiliated with them in one way or another but it’s time to spread our wings and hopefully help other acts succeed along the way.\\n\\nWhat are we actually getting hype for first?\\n\\nChris: RocketGunzBlazin’ is what you’re getting!\\n\\nNick: We just wanted to add that ALL of our releases on ‘Get Hype’ will be available for FREE in MP3 format directly from our website…all you have to do is join our mailing list, you will only have to do this once and then when new music is released it will be there waiting for you completely FREE.\\n\\nChris: This is something we felt strongly about & we want to give back to the listener and have better support for the artists. We want as many people to hear the music and have the best means of supporting our artists.\\n\\nNick: Musically, anyone that knows our sound and music will know it’s pretty big, bashy and in your face but I think the next batch of music we have is gonna really firmly imprint that sound on everyone and the label will be at the forefront of everything we do from now on.

       " 'Analysis Of Pirated Oscar Movies Shows They\\'re Almost All Available... In HD (And Not From Screeners)\\n\\nfrom the because-of-course dept\\n\\nBut here’s the thing: screeners are stuck in the last decade. While we’re all streaming HD movies from iTunes or Netflix, the movie studios almost universally send screeners by mail on DVDs, which is forever stuck in low-resolution standard-definition quality. A small handful are sent in higher-definition Blu-ray.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis year, one Academy member received 68 screeners — 59 on DVD and only eight on Blu-ray. Only 13% of screeners were sent to voters in HD quality.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a result, virtually any HD source is more prestigious than a DVD screener. And with the shift to online distribution, there’s an increasing supply of possible HD sources to draw from before screeners are ever sent to voters.\\n\\nOf this year’s 36 nominated films, 34 already leaked online in some form — everything except Song of the Sea and Glen Campbell: I’ll Be Me.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut only 33% of those were leaked from screeners, down from a high of 89% in 2003 and 2004.\\n\\nAs we\\'ve mentioned in the past, every year for over a decade, Andy Baio scours the internet to see what Oscar-nominated movies have been put online (the answer is usually almost all of them). He started this back in 2004, when the MPAA laughably claimed that the very first \"screener\" copy of a nominated movie had been put online. Baio realized that it was hardly the first and there were many more. His latest analysis is up and it shows that, yet again, nearly all nominated movies are available. He\\'s actually kept the details of every year\\'s search in a big Google spreadsheet There are some interesting findings in the data, including thatmuch any more. For years, the MPAA -- which still can\\'t get over its piracy obsession -- insisted that screener leaks were a huge problem. Back in 2003 the MPAA wanted to ban screener DVDs entirely , which pissed off a bunch of filmmakers who feared that their films wouldn\\'t get voted on for the Oscars. Since then, they\\'ve focused on ridiculous proprietary systems that would only play on special DVD players -- which just pissed off viewers . In the last few years, they\\'ve just focused on watermarked DVDs, which means that when the videos inevitably leak, they can be tracked back to whose copy leaked -- like Ellen Degeneris\\' copies last year.But, as Baio notes, in the online release market, screener copies aren\\'t good enough:And of course, the data also shows that cammed copies (someone sitting in a theater with a camera filming it) are virtually non-existent here. This is another issue that we\\'ve covered for years, with the MPAA famously making up numbers out of thin air concerning how big a \"problem\" it was. But, of course, the quality on those copies suck, and so people focus on HD, which they inevitably get.As he notes, with the MPAA stupidly focused on screeners, they think they\\'re winning the battle, because here\\'s the percentage of actual screeners leaked:So, I\\'m sure the content protection team at the MPAA are all excited about this. They\\'re vanquishing the screener piracy monster. But as Baio points out, that\\'s bullshit, because just as many films are leaking, but in HD quality from HD sources instead of screeners:While this year\\'s figure is currently 89%, there\\'s a decent chance it will go higher before the Oscars happen. As Baio notes, 44% of the films this year are HD sources, not from screeners or from retail releases.In other words: all this effort from the \"content protection\" team at the MPAA yields absolutely no benefit at all.\\n\\nFiled Under: andy baio, copyright, dvds, hd, movies, oscars, piracy, screeners\\n\\nCompanies: mpaa',\n",

       " 'B. Frank Earnest chokes up twice during our afternoon together at Richmond’s Hollywood Cemetery. The first time, he’s describing his ritual of placing a fresh Confederate flag on the grave of his ancestor, Capt. Eusebius Fowlkes. The stone is only a marker. Fowlkes’ remains were never recovered from the field where he rode alongside Col. J.E.B. Stuart, the “Knight of the Golden Spurs,” before being killed in the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31, 1862. Earnest takes pride in the fact that his forefather fought on horseback. His people were horse breeders. In the Confederate army, unlike the elitist Northern one, joining the cavalry was just a matter of showing up with your steed.\\n\\nAccording to family legend, Fowlkes implored his loved ones to care for his gravesite upon his demise, but they abandoned that charge when they couldn’t find a body. It took a little more than a century for Frank Earnest to realize his ancestor’s wishes. In 1978, he says, he erected a memorial to Fowlkes and adorned it with the banner of the doomed republic. For 39 years, he has phoned his cousin in Texas whenever he’s gone to pay his respects. That cousin died in July, Earnest tells me, his voice breaking. Edwin Ray, a longtime friend of Earnest’s who’s come along for the visit, turns to me and murmurs, “You see, for us, it’s all about family.”\\n\\nAs we walk through the graveyard, a burial ground that dates to 1847 and houses the bodies of 22 Confederate generals and thousands of Confederate soldiers, the air seems to shimmer with a hint of the occult: The South will rise again. The septuagenarian Earnest, a retired electrician and Vietnam veteran, has made it his life’s work to preserve a bygone era. He wears a dark suit speckled with Dixie-themed regalia, and his aubergine truck boasts the license plate “CF,” for “Confederate Frank.” When I’d explained on the phone who I was and what I hoped he’d show me, he offered to pick me up at the train station in Richmond, telling me to look for “a friendly older gentleman with a full gray beard and a big belly.” Now, in the cemetery, my tour guide sounds more melancholy than merry. Earnest suffers from a lung condition that can make breathing difficult, and he’s hoarse and cranky from talking to reporters all week.\\n\\nHe points out the great granite pyramid, 90 feet high, dedicated to the troops in gray in 1869. He says no one could figure out how to install the capstone until a convict traded the solution for a pardon. We pass Gen. George Edward Pickett, who, Earnest recounts, fell in love with the young Sallie Anne Corbell while preparing to march on Gettysburg. After Pickett’s disastrous offensive, his bosses granted him time off to get married. The devoted men of Virginia removed the carriage horses from their traces and fastened themselves in to pull the general and his bride to the train station. We linger at the mausoleum of Jefferson Davis, whom my escort refers to as “the president.” “You probably don’t like President Trump, and to be honest I’m not too thrilled with President Obama,” he tells me. “But like it or not, they were president, and President Davis was our president.” I must look skeptical. “Aren’t you the folks who want to go around giving everyone a participation trophy?” he snaps.\\n\\nFrank Earnest of the Virginia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans stands at the base of the Robert E. Lee memorial on Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia. Katy Waldman/Slate\\n\\nThe bronze effigy of Davis winks in the sunshine, a participation trophy if I’ve ever seen one. Earnest, meanwhile, has withdrawn once more into the 19th century. Not among these dead, he intones, is Davis’ son Jim Limber, a black boy freed and then adopted by Davis’ wife. “Union troops took Jim Limber away” when the first couple of the Confederacy retreated to Danville, Virginia, he says mournfully. “They didn’t think it was right to have an African child in a white family. But I tell people that we Southerners were way ahead of President Obama: We put a black in the Confederate White House.”\\n\\nI’ll learn later that the horse thief who placed the stone atop Hollywood Cemetery’s pyramid was not pardoned but “transferred,” that the fairy-tale image of Pickett’s soldiers pulling his coach to the railroad has no basis in reality, and that Mrs. Davis plucked Jim Limber from his home without much thought while the circumstances surrounding the child’s disappearance during the Civil War remain murky. In telling a series of made-up stories about the South and its standard bearers, Earnest was just doing his job. He serves as heritage defense coordinator and spokesman for the Virginia division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a group that has avowed to teach “the true history of the War Between the States, especially in these times when our heritage is under constant attack.”\\n\\nOn the national level, the SCV—an organization that dates back to 1896—describes its mission as seeking to preserve “the history and legacy of these heroes so that future generations can understand the motives that animated the Southern Cause.” The sons, though, are not content merely to protect the sanctity of those monuments that have already been built. The group, which counts some 30,000 members in 800 “camps” across the United States, is responsible for funding the majority of the 31 Confederate icons constructed in the U.S. since 2000. Through fundraising, lawsuits, press events, and vigorous Facebooking, they are riding once more in defense of Dixie, promulgating a romantic vision of the Old South even as historians and activists try to tear that vision down.\\n\\nAs the conversation around Confederate memorials—what they stand for, and whether they should stand at all—grows increasingly turbulent, the SCV sees itself as a home for those Donald Trump described in his post-Charlottesville press conference as “very fine people”: patriots who might march alongside Klansmen and neo-Nazis in defense of a statue yet who disavow bigotry and violence. With monuments tumbling to the earth in Baltimore, Orlando, Louisville, and elsewhere, these self-appointed protectors of Southern heritage find themselves balanced on a moral high wire. Can you love Stonewall Jackson and shun white supremacy? Can a neo-Confederate be a “very fine person”?\\n\\nEarnest is savvy enough, in the wake of August’s white nationalist violence, to understand why approximately 17 different press outlets have dialed his number in recent weeks. Standing at the foot of Davis’ icon in Hollywood Cemetery, both of us sunblind, he pauses like someone about to throw down his winning card.\\n\\n“I like to think that Dr. Martin Luther King would have wanted these statues to stay up.”\\n\\nThe myth of Dixie has long served as a kind of racism laundry service. Most of the country’s Confederate statuary wasn’t built until the first third of the 20th century, as part of an advertising campaign for white supremacy. The monuments, many of them commissioned by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, sold “separate but equal” by shrouding racism in sepia romance, glorifying a status quo in which Southern whites didn’t have to sit next to black people on the bus or compete with them for jobs.\\n\\nMass-produced cheaply in Northern factories and shipped down South by railroad, likenesses of John Pelham, Nathan Bedford Forrest, Raphael Semmes, and Patrick Cleburne incarnated a tenuous moral argument, one that went something like: We don’t disrespect black people. We’re just reveling in the courage of those who took up arms against Lincoln’s aggression. We stand not for hate but for heritage. But the statues stood for both, united in an inextricable skein. Why else connect Jim Crow to Jefferson Davis?\\n\\nThis foregrounding of political agenda over artistic vision explains the casual approach to design, construction, and assembly. Monuments were crafted from budget materials (zinc, bronze), fastened loosely to their plinths (making them easier for protesters to drag down), and styled generically, as if their creators couldn’t be bothered to imagine a pose other than “parade rest.” Last month, I called them “bargain-bin racist tchotchkes.” They felt, then and now, like the perfect emblem for Trump himself—lazy effigies that ascribed glory to a sordid, white supremacist past.\\n\\nWhile the United Daughters of the Confederacy slowed its building frenzy in the latter part of the 20th century, Lost Cause statues—a granite monument to gray-clad soldiers in South Carolina, a stele at a courthouse in Tennessee—continued to rise. Consider the Confederate Memorial of the Wind in Orange, Texas, a circle of 13 columns (for the 13 Confederate states) festooned with 32 regional military flags and eight fluttering iterations of William Thompson’s stars and bars that is currently under construction on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. (Yes, really.) These newer projects were sponsored by chapters of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.\\n\\nIn the last few decades, Earnest’s society has retooled itself into the propagandist arm of a vanished regime. Once a haven for history buffs and genealogical researchers, the SCV now champions Dixie “heritage,” often in the courts. The group has pursued lawsuits against local governments for planning to remove Confederate monuments, against the state of Texas for declining to offer Confederacy-themed vanity plates, and against a Virginia school for chastising a “young lady wishing to express her pride in her Southern heritage by wearing Confederate themed clothing.” Like the government it exalts, the SCV is loosely organized: Regional branches do the legwork of raising money for new sculptures, lobbying private landowners to instate them, swarming city council meetings, and organizing festivals and unveilings. They also maintain several lively Facebook pages, on which you can browse through photos of historical re-enactments, order an official SCV blazer, sign up to clean Confederate headstones, and read slanted press coverage of the culture wars.\\n\\nAfter white supremacists paraded through Charlottesville in August to protest the removal of a Robert E. Lee memorial, the sons felt compelled to distance themselves from the thugs whose hateful rampage left a counter-protester dead. The SCV’s chief of heritage operations, Carl V. Jones, told me that “the events in Charlottesville had nothing to do with us.” Jones’ Virginian compatriots had initiated a legal battle with the city over the statue, he says, but not because they viewed it as a racist rallying point. In a statement released shortly after the march, Jones repudiated “attempts by any group that advocates hatred, bigotry, or violence toward others to use our symbols.”\\n\\nSince the late 1980s, the SCV charter has forbidden its members from associating with hate groups. Before that prohibition was codified, the sons’ moderate wing had accused moles from the secessionist, white supremacist League of the South of corrupting their “historical honor society.” (The ensuing conflict led to the creation of a splinter sect, Save the Sons of Confederate Veterans.) Yet in practice, the supposedly kinder, gentler SCV seems more interested in protecting antebellum insignias from the predations of political correctness than in wresting the stars and bars from the hands of racists. (None of the SCV’s lawsuits, for instance, target neo-Nazis for polluting the Confederate name.) “The memory and reputation of the Confederate soldier, as well as the motives for his suffering and sacrifice, are being consciously distorted by some in an attempt to alter history,” the group’s website reads. Jones’ post-Charlottesville statement is more explicit; in it, he “denounce[s] the hatred being leveled against our glorious ancestors by radical leftists.”\\n\\nFor the past few weeks, I’ve spent hours on the phone and in person listening to the Sons of Confederate Veterans tell me that everything I think I know about their forebears is wrong. If the Civil War was not about slavery, then what was it about? Taxes, naturally. Freedom and self-determination. It was about Lincoln sailing hostile ships into the sovereign waters of South Carolina, provoking Confederate forces into firing the first shot. The president said it himself in his first inaugural: I have no purpose to interfere with slavery, no lawful right, no inclination. Lincoln invaded for the sole purpose of maintaining properties belonging to the U.S.\\n\\ngovernment. He invaded because the South was too beautiful and proud and powerful. Did you know that the Emancipation Proclamation of 1862 was conditional upon the South not rejoining the Union? Did you know that slavery was legal in the North? Only 6 percent of Southerners ran large plantations with multiple slaves. The Civil War was about brotherhood. Jefferson Davis understood that secession would mean the end of slavery, and he was fine with that. Southerners opposed slavery—even the slave owners!—but they wanted it to end on natural terms. It was about God and family. Have you heard of the Missouri Compromise? The Civil War was about honor.\\n\\nIn this poetic narrative, the South seceded from the Union to enshrine states’ rights in law, with race forming a distant second or third consideration. The SCV isn’t fighting to protect a set of historical facts about the Civil War so much as it’s fighting to control who interprets those facts and assembles them into a bildungsroman for the nation. The fantasy of the Lost Cause is a dream of white American innocence, one in which slavery is elided or explained away.\\n\\nEven if slavery represented only one marginal point of contention between North and South—a view that no serious scholars would entertain—it still taints Dixie’s cause with irreducible evil. The Sons of Confederate Veterans see their legacy differently. To them, the South was no more complicit in perpetuating a system of human bondage than the North. “We’re historians,” Jones told me when I asked about the disconnect between his views and those of a growing number of Americans. “We don’t denounce the symbols, but we do denounce what people think they stand for.”\\n\\nThe Sons of Confederate Veterans occupy an increasingly disorienting position. As monuments to the Old South fall like dominos and racial tensions flare under a president seduced by the music if not the lyrics of white nationalism, these men find themselves insisting on Robert E. Lee’s nobility even as they dutifully rebuke the Ku Klux Klan. It is not easy to argue, in this moment, that a memorial to Gen. John Bell Hood—whose forces nearly destroyed the Union army at the Second Battle of Bull Run—does not celebrate a regime dedicated to hatred and oppression.\\n\\nFor clarity on the tolerance question, Jones encouraged me to speak to the SCV’s “multiple” black members. When I asked for names, he could only come up with Nelson Winbush, an 88-year-old retired assistant principal from Kissimmee, Florida. Winbush, who as perhaps the lone black affiliate of the SCV boasts his own Wikipedia page, did not reply to my request for comment. But the Tampa Bay Times reports that his enslaved grandfather was pressed into fighting for the Confederacy; the younger Winbush has been known to sing at public events that “black is only a darker shade of rebel gray.”\\n\\nThe sons want us to extend to our white forefathers a grace that black people haven’t seen in any American century.\\n\\nI did talk to Neil Block, a white SCV commander (the organization favors military titles) from Huntsville, Missouri. Block, emphasizing that he spoke for himself rather than his camp or the organization as a whole, denounced what he termed the “lawlessness” in Charlottesville. (The SCV, incidentally, awarded then–Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio its “Law and Order” prize in 2011.) “We put a man on the moon, and there they are whapping on each other like a bunch of squirrels,” Block complained. In folksy, rambling sentences full of the same warm and misplaced equanimity I’d heard from Jones, he proposed that liberals and conservatives are engaged in a fruitless tug-of-war over the past. “You cannot judge history,” he said. “The only history you can judge is your last breath. There’s nothing that happened yesterday that can’t be whitewashed or blackwashed or tarred and feathered. We didn’t talk enough 150 years ago. Everyone was just scrapping over a dime. And now they’re at it again.”\\n\\nIt’s hard to resist the aw-shucks charm of an old man calling for fair-mindedness, communication, and the suspension of judgment. But the Sons of Confederate Veterans are not annalists meekly tending to antique gravesites. They are activists in the guise of pacifists, seeking to impose their views on a country that has not yet wrestled with its racial sins. As we (finally) contemplate discarding the symbols of our nation’s most wretched episode, the SCV wants to extend to our white forefathers a grace that black people haven’t seen in any American century.\\n\\nThey have their work cut out for them. The 2015 murder of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, by Dylann Roof—a white supremacist fond of wrapping himself in the stars and bars—made the Dixie legend feel less nostalgic than poisonous, a lure for racist lunatics. Ten days after the shooting, activist Bree Newsome scaled a 30-foot pole outside the South Carolina State House and tore down the battle flag. Statues have fallen in New Orleans, and one was boisterously toppled in Durham, North Carolina, while another was vandalized by night in Kansas City. The Washington National Cathedral recently exiled two stained-glass panels picturing Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson from its nave. (Church leaders decided that the windows, installed in 1953, did not represent “an appropriate part of the sacred fabric of a spiritual home for the nation.”) At a moment when even NASCAR has sped away from the stars and bars, B. Frank Earnest and his colleagues are feeling lonelier than ever, if no less convinced of their ancestors’ innocence, and their own.\\n\\nEarnest’s capsule history of the Lee memorial on Richmond’s Monument Avenue unspools as indignant poetry. Defeated Virginians knew how difficult it had been for their general, the grandson of one of Washington’s lieutenants, to take up arms against the Union. Desperate to honor the man who strove to defend their hallowed land at tremendous personal cost, Southerners decided to raise a statue. The parts were cast in France and shipped to Richmond in 1890. Upon their arrival, a crowd of 10,000 loaded those parts into four wagons and dragged them to the spot where Lee stands today, on a broad, tree-lined stretch of road. Monument Avenue is full of Confederate heroes just like him. “And all of that just to irritate the blacks!” Earnest marvels facetiously.\\n\\nThe voices of Confederate sympathizers are no longer the only ones, or the loudest ones, in the conversation about which icons should rise above our cities. Levar Stoney, the black mayor of Richmond, put together a commission to examine removing “rallying point[s] for division and intolerance and violence.” Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe wants to see the memorials taken down and relocated to museums, while Republican gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie advocates placing them in “proper historical context.” Lee and his bronze, granite, and marble brethren were installed at a time when white people controlled the stories we told about our collective past.\\n\\nThe voices of Confederate sympathizers are no longer the only ones, or the loudest ones, in the conversation.\\n\\nEarnest isn’t interested in relaxing his chokehold on those narratives. He prefers to excuse the South swiftly so we can all go back to venerating it. “I’m not saying slavery wasn’t an issue,” he says. “It was an evil that should have been ended, and thank God it was.” But he explains that the peculiar institution amounted to “a national sin, not a Southern sin,” one for which the Confederacy was unfairly scapegoated. He reminds me that slaves first arrived on this country’s shores in ships flying the American flag. “If slavery was a drug and Southerners were users,” he insists, “the Northerners were the dealers.” And setting aside that false equivalence, was human bondage really so terrible? “I agree with the South’s cause,” Block told me on the phone, repeating himself when I noted that the South’s cause included the propagation of slavery. “It can’t be all bad or the black folks wouldn’t have put up with it.” Earnest’s friend Edwin Ray glowingly detailed the “close ties of affection” binding owners and chattel. “It’s a myth that slavery was always violent and evil,” he said.\\n\\nRay ventured this to me, a white woman, without a whiff of aggression or confrontation. He and his colleagues are well-practiced at imprinting a willful, bottomless naiveté over unimaginable cruelty. They present as compassionate—big guys with big beards and big hearts—but choose to ignore the crimes of the Old South in order to revere their ancestors in peace.\\n\\nHollywood Cemetery in Richmond Katy Waldman\\n\\nThe sons have made a moral bargain: They will dehumanize black Americans to the degree necessary to pretend that every pro-Confederacy argument wasn’t rendered moot the minute the South decided to fight for its slaves. They have also made a vow: to heave the racist past into the present, erecting new monuments and holding new ceremonies. Their charm and gentility is part of their strategy. How could a message of celebration and honor possibly hurt anyone?\\n\\nAt a time when a growing number of Americans see their cause as hateful, the sons do not appear willing to reckon with why that might be. “When should the slaves have been freed?” I asked Ray, after he complained about the rancors and disruptions of a hasty Reconstruction. “When they died,” he answered.\\n\\nThe second time Frank Earnest gets choked up, he is talking about his dad. “One of the lowest times of my life was when my father died,” he tells me. The elder Earnest was felled by his own lung condition less than 12 hours after driving to the hospital as a precaution. At the funeral home, the director asked Earnest about pallbearers. “We had grandsons and nephews,” he remembers. “But there were two or three rows of Sons of Confederate Veterans sitting behind us, and my sister said: ‘What about them?’ And they just all rose at once.”\\n\\nBehold the best version of the SCV: a band of brothers who’ve taken a solemn pledge to watch over monuments, graves, memories, and one another. “These are our dead,” Earnest says, gesturing at the 18,000 carefully tended tombstones of Confederate soldiers that dot the field below us. “Some came back by boat, some by train. There’s a lot more to our story.”\\n\\nAs he invokes the ghosts whose reputation is his life’s work, I again feel the air tremble with superstitious expectation. But the gravestones in Hollywood Cemetery don’t tell the full story either. In the Confederate age, Earnest explains, black men and women were interred elsewhere, in private and often unmarked tombs. They paid the cost of the Dixie fantasy, and their descendants are paying the cost of the sons’ nostalgia for it.\\n\\nPublished Sept 25, 2017, 5:54 AM ET',\n",

       " 'Donald Trump wants to run the American government. He has no prior experience in politics or government service, pointing instead to his career in business. But as the operator of mostly privately owned companies, Trump has primarily been in it just to enrich himself. A more illuminating aspect of Trump the businessperson was his stint as chair of a public traded company — a scenario in which he was supposed to be the steward of not just his own interests but those of the company’s shareholders.\\n\\nWhat happened over the course of his decade at the helm of Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts is that he ran the company into the ground, immiserating shareholders while walking away with enormous bags of cash for himself.\\n\\nThanks to a leaked copy of his 1995 tax return, the basic story fact that Donald Trump built a mini empire of Atlantic City casinos that crashed and burned in the early 1990s is now well-known. What’s not yet well-understood by the public is the even more important story of what happened next. As Russ Buettner and Charles Bagli write in Wednesday’s New York Times, 1995 was also the year in which “Trump began the transaction that would eventually free him from his financial travails.”\\n\\nMom-and-pop investors who had the misfortune to put their confidence in Trump lost nearly everything. But as a performance of low cunning, his stewardship of THCR really did verge on genius. The company itself was a dumpster fire, losing money every year Trump served as chair. But he managed to personally pocket $44 million in salary and bonuses. Even more egregiously, he offloaded personal debts onto the corporate balance sheet and had the public company purchase services ranging from bottled water to plane flights from Trump’s privately held enterprises.\\n\\nAlong the way, he bankrupted the company and all but completely wiped out the value of its stock. If you want to be generous to Trump, the saga shows that he really does have some impressive business skills. He spun gold out of worthless casinos in a declining resort town with a dazzling efficacy.\\n\\nIf you want to be less generous, you see that the one time Trump’s leadership skills were put to the test as an agent of middle-class people’s economic well-being, he ripped those people off ruthlessly and unapologetically. As president, Trump would be a custodian of the American people’s interests — just as he was of THCR shareholders’ interests as chair. And unless he’s had a drastic change of heart, he’d be an incredibly ineffective one.\\n\\nDonald Trump’s stock market con\\n\\nStocks were to the 1990s what junk bonds were to the 1980s and single-family homes to the 2000s — the hot asset class that got so hot it increasingly attracted naive middle-class investors hoping to make a quick buck, and unscrupulous financial actors hoping to make a quick buck off the naive investors.\\n\\nIn Trump’s case, stock mania was a golden opportunity to get out from under the legacy of his disastrous performance as an investor in the early 1990s.\\n\\nTrump emerged from his companies’ bankruptcy still in possession of his key assets but saddled with debts that he had personally guaranteed. What\\'s more, as David Cay Johnston writes, in order to carry forward the tax value of his billion-dollar loss after receiving relief from some of his debts through bankruptcy, Trump would have had to agree to give up certain valuable commercial real estate tax breaks that are typically central to CRE deals.\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, to maximize the value of his holdings Trump needed to find a way to sell casinos to people who didn\\'t know anything about the nuances of real estate tax law. The mom-and-pop stock investors of the mid-’90s were the perfect suckers, and they bought into the Trump Casino & Hotel Resorts IPO to the tune of $140 million.\\n\\nThe company’s sole asset at the time was the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, and the IPO money was supposed to be reinvested in the company. But Trump Plaza was already indebted, so one of the first moves made with the new equity was to pay down the debts — debts that Trump had personally guaranteed, meaning that company money was used to relieve not just a company debt but a personal debt owed by Trump himself.\\n\\nTrump tunneled money out of the public company\\n\\nHaving hooked a parade of marks, Trump’s next move was to tunnel as much money as possible out of the public company and into his pockets. One easy way to do that was for Trump to have the company he controlled buy things he owned personally.\\n\\nThe public company bought the Trump Castle casino from Trump, for example, for $490 million, a price that James Sterngold reported at the time “was based on optimistic profit projections and was about $100 million too high.” Trump also paid himself $880,000 for brokering the deal.\\n\\nChristina Binkley reported on April 11, 1997, on Trump’s obscene pay package for himself:\\n\\nDonald J. Trump received a $7 million pay package in 1996, including a $5 million bonus and a 71% salary increase, despite a more than 70% drop in the shares of Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc. from their high last year. In addition to his bonus, Mr. Trump, the company\\'s chairman, received a salary of $1 million and another $1 million to cover services rendered by Mr. Trump\\'s privately held companies to Trump Hotels, according to the company\\'s recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n\\nThe company’s share price dropped because it was unprofitable. And it was unprofitable because it ended up assuming $1.7 billion in debt as part of its acquisition of formerly Trump-owned enterprises. Trump was, in essence, paying himself a high salary for the trouble of running a company whose main purpose was to take enormous bad debts off his personal balance sheet and shift them over to the company.\\n\\n“Other than the stock price, we\\'re doing great,\" he told Binkley.\\n\\nBut Drew Harwell’s analysis of the company’s financial records this June shows that the tunneling took on a more extreme scope. In addition to assuming Trump’s personal debts and paying him an exorbitant salary, Trump’s public company was a heavy purchaser of services from Trump’s privately held companies:\\n\\nAs the company spiraled downward, it continued to pay for Trump’s luxuries. Between 1998 and 2005, it spent more than $6 million to “entertain high-end customers” on Trump’s plane and golf courses and about $2 million to maintain his personal jet and have it piloted, a Post analysis of company filings shows. Trump also steered the company toward deals with the rest of the Trump-brand empire. Between 2006 and 2009, the company bought $1.7 million of Trump-brand merchandise, including $1.2 million of Trump Ice bottled water, the analysis shows.\\n\\n“A shareholder who bought $100 of DJT shares in 1995 could sell them for about $4 in 2005,” Harwell concluded. “The same investment in MGM Resorts would have increased in value to about $600.”\\n\\nThe company went bankrupt, and shareholders saw the value of their remaining stake further reduced as creditors seized a large share of the equity. Trump himself was a major shareholder, so he lost out in the bankruptcy. But since the unsustainable debts had previously been owed by him personally, it was a huge net win for Trump even as his investors took further losses.\\n\\nThe art of the deal\\n\\nThe basic facts of this story have been widely reported over the years and revisited as part of the 2016 campaign. They haven’t managed to worm their way into the main campaign narrative, however, because they paint a somewhat complicated picture.\\n\\nTrump himself is obviously not eager to call attention to his huckster history. For the Clinton campaign, it probably makes more sense to focus on the idea of Trump as an incompetent rich kid losing daddy’s money than on his shrewd and complicated swindle. What’s more, Clinton’s husband was president at the time of Trump’s most egregious offenses, and revisiting the way he bilked investors is a reminder that Clinton-era financial regulators were not nearly as protective of middle-class investors as they should have been.\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is, however, that whatever mistakes Trump has made in his career, the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts episode was a tour de force. The total sum Trump netted — not just in terms of salary and fees but in terms of cash paid to his other businesses, personal debts canceled, and overpriced assets bought — is incalculable. And while it would be a mistake to say it was all perfectly legal (there were money laundering fines, securities law violations, campaign finance fines, etc.), it was legal enough to work.\\n\\nFor voters, of course, the question is what side of the table you’re sitting on. Trump now says he’s going to put his skills and shrewdness to work on behalf of the American people, striking great bargains for us vis-à-vis China, Mexico, Japan, and our NATO allies. But of course Trump’s investors thought the same thing. Any casino enterprise is inherently a con; it’s just that they thought the gamblers were the marks and they were in on the con. In the end, the joke was on them. But Trump says it’s different this time.\\n\\nWatch: Trump hates lies, but can\\'t tell the truth',\n",
       " 'For the ultimate Japanese food experience, sushi or ramen are certainly the top picks. And while sushi covers all the flavors of the ocean and even some less traditional meaty options, ramen remains a steady choice between four main soup stocks: miso, soy sauce, pork and salt.\\n\\nOf course, more individualistic and unnatural ramen shops exist around Japan, but never before had we heard of a ramen restaurant specializing in sea urchin ramen.\\n\\nUntil now.\\n\\nJapan and especially Tokyo is a mecca for foodies. But wandering the streets looking for a good place to eat will quickly overwhelm you.

Sounds like a place that has a lot of seafood!\\n\\nThe menu won’t let you down, as you don’t often see ramen featuring clam, lobster and crab, so perhaps we are witnessing the birth of a new fishy fad.

Intended use is for aerial video and first-person view (FPV) flying.(Picture shows all the parts - camera is not included, and this is model here is only the back cage. Check the 3D model to see it. For the complete kit you have to order the back cage , the front lid , the servo cage and the mounting arm . You will also need 3x MKS470 servos, and a 16mm x 8mm ball bearing, not shown)Video demonstration:- the current version has been slightly improved from the version in the video (I strengthened some of the elastic parts and improved the balancing). The gyro control board is my own design and currently not available yet. I will post an update once it is. The IMU is my design as well, and is available here.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are welcome to order this design now, but be aware that it\\'s still somewhat \"beta\". Whatever you do with it is entirely your own risk and responsibility, I unfortunately cannot make any claims towards its usefulness, stability or safety...I would recommend, before you put this on a flying contraption, consider using a safety string to attach the camera to the plane somehow. GoPro cameras are very robust inside their waterproof case, but not quite so robust without that protection. They don\\'t like crashing into the ground (and trust me, I know - as is probably obvious from the picture of my camera... in all fairness, it did mostly survive...)For the complete kit you have to order the back cage , the front lid , the servo cage and the mounting arm . The bearing at the top is a 16mm outer, 8mm inner diameter ball bearing, available from many places. Hobbyking sells those as well.I will possibly modify the mounting bracket in the future and also offer one with a smaller bearing... this one is total overkill! :)The servos that will fit are the MKS DS470 (available e.g. from Hobbyking). They do have a little play, but they are very smooth and by far the fastest servo I\\'ve seen in that size and price class. I\\'m still on the lookout for different servos that might be a bit smoother.Assembly:1) Press the servos onto the mounting bracket and the flexible arms of the back cage. What works quite well is to carefully push it on just a little (best to put the printed piece onto a flat surface, and gently push the servo in just a bit to align). Then use a screw (maybe with a washer to spread the force), and slowly pull the arm onto the crown. You only have to do that once, it\\'ll be a tight, smooth fit afterwards.Remove the servos again after this step.2) Mount the 3 servos on the servo mounting frame. Start with the yaw servo (the vertical one in the middle).The yaw servo crown has to face downwards (might be a bit fiddly). Make sure the crown of the yaw servo is aligned with the little stub axle on the opposite side. The two roll/pitch servos have to be inserted so that the crown faces the camera (towards the flat side of the mounting arm).3) Press the mounting bracket onto the yaw servo crown, and put in the screw to hold it in place. On the opposite side, press in the 16mm/8mm ball bearing.4) Carefully push the disk-shaped closure knob into the cylinder at the top of the camera back cage. You might need to rotate it a bit to ease it into place5) Push the flexible arms of the back cage onto the two roll/pitch servos, and fix with screws.--: Seems the MKS has too much gain for the yaw axis, and tends to oscillate a bit with all that weight swinging around. They are fine for the Pitch/Roll arms. I\\'m still looking for a small servo with high speed, smoothness and no (or little) play... Suggestions are of course welcome!!-- The servos are still a very tight fit into the control arms and the bracket. I already made it a bit larger, but still not enough. What works quite well is to carefully push it on just a little (best to put the arms onto a flat surface, and gently push the servo in just a bit to align). Then use a screw (maybe with a washer to spread the force), and slowly pull the arm onto the crown. You only have to do that once, it\\'ll be a tight, smooth fit afterwards.',\n",
       " 'At the end of the Pleistocene mammoths of Northern Eurasia used to experience chronic mineral hunger. As a result they became extinct due to geochemical stress arising on a background of deep abiotic changes in ecosystems. Most likely they were receiving not enough of essential chemical elements. This hypothesis was developed by TSU paleontologists and based on a large-scale, 15-years long research. Detailed information you can find in an article of Sergei Leshchinsky, Head of Laboratory of Mesozoic and Cenozoic continental ecosystems, TSU Faculty of Geology and Geography. This article was published in Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences.\\n\\nResearchers around the world try to find out causes of extinction of the most prominent representatives of late Pleistocene megafauna - the mammoths. There are two main versions: 1) changes in microclimate and anthropogenic pressure, and possibly simultaneous effect of both factors. There are other much less popular theories of their extinction: 1) infectious diseases or 2) fall of celestial bodies. However, hardly anybody has paid attention to geochemical changes of environment where Mammuthus primigenius lived.\\n\\nInvestigating remains of late mammoths, we frequently find obvious signs of skeletal diseases such as: osteoporosis, osteofibrosis, osteomalacia (softening and bending of bones), arthrosis, and other joint diseases - says Sergei Leshchinsky. He also underlines that articular surface of extremity bones of some individuals are not only harmed but damaged and mutilated by these diseases. As for osteoporosis, in separate collections we found it in 90% of cases.\\n\\nThese diseases resulted in high traumatism of the animals; they got sprains and fractures even at very low loads. Mammoths with broken limbs or spine could not take food in sufficient quantities and could not follow herd. Such individuals died soon hunted by predators. As a result - the nature was stronger than the giant animals, and mammoths became instinct.\\n\\nFrom 2003 to 2013 Sergey Leshchinskiy analyzed over 23,500 bones and teeth of mammoths of Northern Eurasia to identify the symptoms of enzootic diseases. The destructive changes were revealed with the help of a magnifying glass (×10), in polished sections and histological sections under a stereomicroscope (magnification upto200×) and a scanning electron microscope (magnification upto10,000×), as well as by roentgenoscopy and densitometry.\\n\\nWe investigated mammoth bones and teeth, discovered in beast solonetzs lacustrine-alluvial localities of Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic.\\n\\nThe beast solonetz is the Russian term for a ground surface area characterized by a high content of certain macro- and microelements; as such it has a broader interpretation than \"salt lick\", \"mineral lick\" and \"mineral source\". Within the confines of the beast solonetz, animals eat soil and rocks and drink mineralized water from springs to maintain homeostasis, which is equivalent to the definition of \"lithophagy\".\\n\\nMost of chemical elements are vital necessary for animals to retain health condition of skeleton, muscles, skin, hear, and others. Part of animals is doomed if they fail to satisfy a mineral starvation in time.\\n\\nLithophagy or geophagy practiced by primates is a com¬mon phenomenon in modern animal life; there is no doubt, therefore, that the mammoth was the largest of all lithophages in the Late Pleistocene of Northern Eurasia. This assertion is also confirmed by the frequent availability of mineral sub¬stances in the gastro-intestinal tract of mammoth carcasses and their coprolites, sometimes reaching 90% of their mass.\\n\\nAt the highest moment of mineral starvation they became some kind of activity hotbed of mammoths and other large mammals. The particular vulnerability of mammoth in mineral starvation can be reflected in specific mammoth \"cemeteries\" of the late Pleistocene.\\n\\nTSU researchers found mass destructive changes in mammoth bones and teeth up to 70% or more of total number of remains in different collection. In most cases different destructions accompany one another which may indirectly show the same reasons of such consequences. In collection of some excavation areas (Krasnoyarskaya Kurya, Kraków Spadzista Street) probably the most common disease is osteoporosis. We can see rarefaction in all age groups including infant mammoths what means that disease development began in prenatal period since females suffered from mineral starvation. Above all since bone resorption in osteoporosis may be mild marked outwardly; it means that real proportion of remains with signs of osteodystrophy is likely to be higher than can be detected at a superficial examination.\\n\\nWhy did mammoths and other large herbivores with large skeleton experience strong geochemical stress of Pleistocene?\\n\\nAt that time there was a considerable expansion of acidic and acidic-gley geochemical landscapes, resulting in a drastic deficiency of Ca, Mg, Na, P, I, Co, Cu, Se, Zn and other vital chemical elements. The change in habitat is closely associated with the drastic replacement of favourable Ca-Mg-Na landscapes with acidic and acidic-gley ones. The latter reached its maximum range by the end of the Pleistocene, and are still the predominant landscape in most of Northern Eurasia today. This transition can be explained by the general neotectonic lift, which was subsequently followed (17-10 ka BP) by changes in the macroclimate, which became more humid and warmer. As a result, coastal lowlands were flooded and central areas were swamped (degrading permafrost being one of the reasons). The soils of the high plains and foothills were heavily leached due to a lowering of the ground water levels and increased precipitations. In this situation only rare beast solonetz could have served as geochemical oases where the large herbivores could satisfy their mineral hunger. However, by the early Holocene there may have been an insufficient number of these oases to support the viability of isolated mammoth populations. A similar abiotic scenario may be drawn for North America, where mammoths went extinct at the same time.\\n\\nMammoth body size decrease and massive destructive changes in their bones and teeth indicate negative impact of the abiotic environment. Osteoporosis, osteomalacia, diseases of the joints indicate a metabolic disorder of alimentary nature.\\n\\nThe analysis of the clinical picture of the diseases deserves special attention -how rapidly did the disturbances in homeostasis and the formation of osteodystrophy occur in unfavourable geochemical conditions? Based on this study, it appears that the destructive changes developed rapidly: extensive bone pathologies such as those found in the Taymyrskiy mammoth or in the Shestakovo-Kochegur, Berelyokh, Lugovskoe and Krakow Spadzista Street mammoth populations are incompatible with along developmental period. Under conditions of smaller and fewer geochemical oases and predominantly snow or acidic swampy-ground waters as drinking water in the winter, the \"later\" mammoths may have suffered from chronic mineral deficiency for 6- 10 months a year.\\n\\nIt is highly probable that this severe natural condition lasted for more than 15 thousand years and may have proven fatal for the largest representative of the terrestrial fauna at high latitudes, - Sergey Leshchinskiy said. - The wool lyrhinoceros and cave bear may have suffered the same fate. Other large herbivores (bisons, horses and deer) have overcome the Holocene border, perhaps due to their greater mobility, although with a significant reduction of habitat and population size. Large cats and hyenas went extinct probably because of drastic reduction of nutritional resources at the time of the disintegration of the single \"mammoth\" ecosystem.\\n\\nThe very high percentage of skeleton pathologies suggests a high murrain among mammoths, irrespective of anthropogenic impact, which could not lead to this species extermination throughout its huge territory. Man was a witness and one of the participants in the natural process of the Pleistocene megafauna\\'s extinction.\\n\\n###',\n",
       " 'Paul Lee.\\n\\nJust-ousted ABC Entertainment chief Paul Lee spent much of his nearly six years at the network preaching the gospel of “sticky” programming — shows that permeate the pop culture past prime time, generating viewer loyalty and engagement not fully measured by their overnight Nielsen numbers. It’s not that Lee (who was replaced by Channing Dungey, previously ABC’s drama chief) gave up looking for big audiences; he just argued that broadcast networks needed to be more cablelike in choosing series with the ability to resonate beyond any given time slot. For much of his reign, the strategy worked: Factoring out sports and focusing just on scripted series, Lee’s ABC — with buzzy fare such as Scandal, Once Upon a Time, and Black-ish — regularly competed for first in prime time among key demographics and boasted a heavy concentration of the upscale (read: rich) viewers advertisers love. ABC seemed to be a model for how a broadcast network could shine in a world of 400-plus scripted shows. And then came the season from hell.\\n\\nIt can’t be overstated just how much has gone wrong for ABC since the 2015–16 TV season began last September. Save for Sunday freshman Quantico, the Disney-owned network struck out with its new series orders. Subpar Dallas karaoke Blood & Oil lasted just a few weeks before getting the hook. After big-budget biblical epic Of Kings and Prophets was mysteriously pushed from its planned fall launch, the network had to scramble to get serial-murderer mystery Wicked City on the air; it promptly flopped. ABC also (intentionally) rushed its promising reboot of The Muppets, moving from pitch to series in barely six months. The result: After a huge premiere, ratings dropped as audiences rejected a show whose producers clearly hadn’t had the time to fix a number of inherent flaws. ABC then doubled down on the dumb by hiring a new showrunner for Muppets and making her rush a reboot of the reboot earlier this month. Viewers didn’t even show up to check out the changes. Lee was no doubt under enormous pressure to make a big Disney property work, particularly since the presence of The Muppets on ABC’s fourth-quarter schedule helped build advertiser buzz for the network’s fall schedule. But rushing was ultimately a big mistake.\\n\\nBeyond a weak crop of new development, this season has also been a hellscape of disturbing declines in ratings for a slew of established ABC hits. While the Rhimes-produced TGIT block still works as a whole, Scandal and How to Get Away With Murder are down 15 percent and 27 percent, respectively, this season. These declines aren’t disastrous — particularly given the nearly universal declines hitting network TV of late — but they’re a sign that even the mighty Rhimes isn’t immune to the forces of gravity. More worrisome is the big year-to-year drop for long-reliable procedural Castle: After finally hitching its two leads, the show has lost nearly one-third of its under-50 audience this season. And ABC can’t be happy about the unexpectedly large viewership dive for the usually stable Sunday night anchor America’s Funniest Home Videos, which has shed a quarter of its young-adult audience since replacing longtime host Tom Bergeron. Once Upon a Time has also taken a massive hit, though that’s partially because last year’s numbers were inflated by a hugely popular Frozen-related story line.\\n\\nThen, most recently, there’s been the audience reaction to three sophomore series Lee optimistically renewed last spring with the hope they’d be able to build viewership with a little more time: Marvel’s Agent Carter, Galavant, and American Crime. Rather than grow or at least stabilize, Carter and Galavant have lost fully half of the already small number of viewers they averaged a year ago, and are also certainly destined for cancellation. And while Crime is doing a bit better — it’s down 25 percent, with some of that erosion due to no longer having the advantage of a Scandal lead-in— it hasn’t (yet) capitalized on rhapsodic reviews and its season-one Emmy wins.\\n\\nAll three shows have been hurt by the fact that they returned in January, when ABC was in the middle of what it calls its “gap” months — that time when big guns such as the TGIT dramas and Dancing With the Stars are off the air. Overall ratings for ABC plunged in December and January, which meant many viewers probably had no idea the sophomore shows were back. Lee can be criticized for not having a good plan in place for managing these gap months, but, really, all networks are struggling to make sense of the new realities of scheduling. Reruns don’t work anymore, shows are producing fewer original episodes, and audiences like to binge-watch some shows. A bigger, more valid critique of Lee was that he renewed perhaps one too many of his favorite low-rated shows. The auspices and reviews for American Crime made a second season a smart choice, but bringing back both Galavant and Agent Carter when neither did all that well last year? That seemed … odd.\\n\\nThe New York Times, which broke the news of Lee’s departure, reported that he and his boss, Disney-ABC TV group chairman Ben Sherwood, clashed over Sherwood’s desire to see ABC program fewer “sticky” shows and a few more meat-and-potatoes hours. (The Wall Street Journal hinted at a similar struggle last month.) And indeed, ABC’s biggest shortcoming right now is the lack of even a single hit procedural drama, along the lines of NBC’s Chicago hours or CBS’s multiple cop franchises. Castle filled this role ably for many years but clearly is coming to the end of its natural life. ABC actually had a promising procedural last season — Forever — but it killed it mostly because the show was produced by a non-Disney studio (which means the Alphabet didn’t stand to share in any long-term profits). It’s completely understandable that ABC has been focused on duplicating the Rhimes-perfected formula of sexy, serialized, and, yes, “sticky” storytelling with shows such as Quantico, Secrets and Lies, and, possibly, the upcoming thriller The Family. But there’s also something to be said for the more traditional case-of-the-week form of TV, particularly since such shows don’t have to take off months at a time and can draw in viewers who haven’t seen every single episode. If Sherwood really did make this case, it’s hard not to agree with him.\\n\\nStill, despite being hit by a perfect storm of awfulness since the fall, there’s also a very strong argument to be made that ABC under Lee has actually performed very well, particularly in this era of audience erosion and the shift to nonlinear viewing via streaming and DVRs. Thanks to Lee, ABC either established or improved upon several major centers of strength in its schedule:\\n\\n• Shonda Rhimes’s Thursday dramas, despite experiencing some turbulence of late, remain a collective juggernaut among younger women. Scheduling them together under the TGIT banner was a genius move, and the marketing of the night has been brilliant.\\n\\n• ABC retains what is by far the most successful night of broad-appeal comedy on TV with its Wednesday block of half-hours. Its family-comedy brand has only gotten stronger with 2015 mid-season addition Fresh Off the Boat, which has established a beachhead on Tuesday nights. True, Modern Family continues to fade, but like CBS’s The Big Bang Theory, it’s still a huge hit. And, unlike the Eye’s non-TBBT comedies, the rest of ABC’s Wednesday comedies are all big, healthy hits that make sense together. Lee pushed to make ABC’s comedies reflect America’s diversity, and it has paid off handsomely. (Of course, he also killed Cristela, Happy Endings, and Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23 way too soon. #NeverForget.)\\n\\n• Sunday night’s Quantico was arguably the most successful new series launch last fall, rocketing into Nielsen’s top 20 among adults under 50 without the benefit of a big lead-in. (NBC’s Blindspot has a bigger audience, but it’s also gotten a boost from following The Voice.)\\n\\n• On Mondays, Dancing With Stars draws big (albeit older) audiences in the fall, while The Bachelor attracts millennial eyeballs in droves. Both franchises predate Lee, of course. But he and his team have arguably helped strengthen them and extended their runs.\\n\\n• And over the summer, ABC shocked the TV industry with the massive success of the Steve Harvey–hosted Celebrity Family Feud, one of the few new unscripted hits to be launched by a broadcast network in recent years. After a misguided attempt to rebrand ABC’s reality division by bringing in a former E! network executive, Lee deserves credit for giving current ABC unscripted boss Robert Mills the freedom to go after broader audiences. It’s worked.\\n\\nGiven the many positive accomplishments that can be credited to Lee over his five-and-a-half-year run at the network, his ouster Wednesday seems likely to end being seen as less about his record at producing results and more about a personality clash with Sherwood. Disney in general, and the ABC TV Group in particular, are known for their incredibly cutthroat corporate cultures. The man Lee replaced, former ABC boss Steve McPherson, was forever battling his boss, Anne Sweeney, who herself ended up “resigning” and was replaced by … Sherwood. While ABC’s recent bad run of luck can’t be entirely dismissed, it seems Lee’s ultimate undoing was the result not of a bad development season, but rather an inability to manage up.',\n",
       " 'Share\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo-nonsense club sounds from an anonymous trio.\\n\\nIn a 2012 profile piece, Kristan Caryl was left groping for information on the Berlin-based production outfit ItaloJohnson. 18 months later, we\\'re still unsure what to tell you. The group\\'s overriding message (which they communicated through a \"spokesman\" via email) was a desire to let the music do the talking. So let\\'s focus on that. ItaloJohnson have just released the eighth instalment in their self-titled vinyl series. Its three simple, arresting hardware jams are very much a continuation of the series\\' overall vibe. \"We don\\'t have a master plan or a special old-school ideology,\" they told Caryl. \"We just do the stuff as we like it, just go with the flow.\" There is an air of functionality attached to ItaloJohnson\\'s music, but little touches like the vocal on the third release\\'s A-side, or the synth-strings on the fifth release\\'s B-side make their tracks more than just DJ tools. They\\'ve also stepped out of their self-contained world a couple of times recently, turning in bumping remixes for Hotflush (The White Lamp) and Tsuba (Spencer Parker).\\n\\n\\n\\nItaloJohnson\\'s low-key approach may frustrate the press sometimes, but it hasn\\'t harmed their DJ careers. So far in 2014 they\\'ve played Berghain, Trouw, Concrete and Corsica Studios, and have a set at Dimensions festival in Croatia on the horizon. Their style is a straightforward but hypnotizing meeting between house and techno, which shines through brightly on this week\\'s RA podcast.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat have you been up to recently?\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have been playing quite a lot lately, and we\\'ve met a whole bunch of decent and interesting people, and have been hungover in many inspiring places. We crafted a remix for Hotflush and, not to forget, just finished working on our 8th release, which we\\'re really happy about. It\\'s been a while since our 7th release.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow and where was the mix recorded?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe three of us met up on a Sunday in April with our packed record bags. We recorded the mix in one go with two Technics 1210 and an Allen & Heath mixer. We also put the biggest speakers we could get into one of our living rooms to generate some kind of a club feeling—the neighbours really loved us for that. We just totally forgot about a crowd. Next time we will definitely hire one.\\n\\n\\n\\nCan you tell us about the idea behind the mix?\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are two crucial factors that lead us to record the mix in this particular way. One of the aspects is the selection and the arrangement of the tracks. The other one is how we mixed and recorded the piece.\\n\\n\\n\\nConcerning the selection it was important for us to give the listener a hint of each and every one of our styles. Some of the tunes are declared evergreens to us that we always wanted to present in a podcast, others are supposed to show our emotional side, and yet others are manifesting our more dry and repetitive bias. Something that was really important to us was to compile a mix that could have been recorded some years ago or could maybe be recorded in some years—something as timeless as possible according to our standards. The way we mixed and recorded the whole thing should give the audience an idea of the aesthetic that forms our DJ styles. It surely can be described as a club-oriented mix.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do you usually approach three-way DJing?\\n\\n\\n\\nWe usually hold some kind of a phone conference not to bring the same records. We also make sure as death that the clubs are providing more than just one bottle of booze for us. While one of us is mixing the others are celebrating—how should it be otherwise. Apart from playing back-to-back-to-back pretty much everything is off-the-cuff decisions and other fortunate accidents.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs there a mood or feeling you try to evoke in your sets?\\n\\n\\n\\nOur sets are naturally quite long and improvised. From the starting point of the set we are taking the people by the hand, trying to generate a setting in which everything is possible. For instance, this could be an ecstatic, fist pumping house moment, which is rather often the case. On the other hand there is definitely the hard-hitting techno moment that can flow into a repetitive and infinite loop sound, which is causing a meditative state of mind. In the end the actual hidden agenda is being an essential part of the ceremony and merging with the crowd.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are you up to next?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe very next upcoming thing is ItaloJohnson #08, which will be released on May 5th. This year we will seriously try to release more than just one record, since it was only one last year besides an essential remix for Spencer Parker. We are really looking forward to spring / summer time, playing a number of shows in attractive venues like fabric, Space and Dimensions Festival. Another highlight for us will definitely be playing at Trouw one more time before they have to shut down—sad as it is. Nevertheless we will try to spend as much time as possible in the studio. Still trying not to reinvent the wheel.',\n",
       " 'You’ve probably seen the headlines announcing that by 2020 the United States will pass Saudi Arabia as the world’s largest oil producer, and that by 2030 North America will be a net exporter of oil. The International Energy Agency, representing 28 of the world’s richest countries, comes to that conclusion in its annual report, World Energy Outlook 2012. Most of that expansion will come from non-traditional sources — especially shale oil and tar sands.\\n\\nLorne Stockman of Oil Change International draws our attention to another of the report’s conclusions, one that hasn’t been widely reported. The IEA notes that with every passing year it is harder to believe that average global warming can be kept below 2°C – the level at which scientists say catastrophic climate change will become avoidable. And it says:\\n\\n“No more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the 2°C goal.”\\n\\nThat’s not the opinion of some flaky tree-hugger. It’s the considered judgment of the world’s leading authorities on energy. If we don’t leave at least two-thirds of oil in the soil, the climate will boil.\\n\\nHow is the industry responding to this?\\n\\nStockman points out that the Alberta Tar Sands alone has enough projects producing, under construction and approved “to blow well past the climate limits prescribed by the IEA.” What’s more, the oil industry has still more tar sands projects waiting regulatory decisions, “leading to a possible trebling of production capacity over and above the IEA limit.”\\n\\nIn other words, no matter what happens elsewhere, if we don’t shut down the Alberta Tar Sands, the world is cooked.\\n\\n———\\n\\nIan\\n\\nMore from my notebook',\n",

No, he’s running for president, and the president isn’t in charge of the business decisions of private companies.\\n\\nIt’s Not Government’s Job to Employ You\\n\\nIt’s never a happy thing to see people fired (although the Mexicans living in or around Monterrey might be happy about new job opportunities), but 20 million people are laid off or discharged per year. It’s a fact of life. Former NBC CEO (and current CNN president) Jeff Zucker said “Nobody is entitled to any job” when rumors of his eventual dismissal were circulating in 2010.\\n\\nMany want to try to use the government to solve an individual’s problems.\\n\\nBut many Americans and their elected officials assume government should do something to help find a job for us or take care of us in the event that we lose a job. Whether it is extending unemployment benefits indefinitely or threatening to slam 45 percent tariffs on imported products put together by people we don’t think deserve a job because they aren’t Americans, the idea is the same: Many want to try to use the government to solve an individual’s problems.\\n\\nEconomists and columnists have pointed out the practical problems with Trump’s and Sanders’ proposals. More than doubling the minimum wage would increase prices and make it harder for companies to hire. Jared Bernstein, who served as Vice President Joe Biden’s top economist, said it didn’t make sense to be implemented across the country. One-quarter of the employees at Carrier’s Indianapolis plant made $1 per hour less than Sanders’ proposed minimum wage. Increasing it could hasten job loss.\\n\\nMost manufacturing job losses have been due to greater efficiency, not outsourcing.\\n\\nIncreasing our tariffs astronomically would similarly raise prices on consumers and violate World Trade Organization rules and start a trade war. We live in a globalized world, and many products, like computers and smartphones of brands Trump likes to mention, have international supply chains. Most manufacturing job losses have been due to greater efficiency, not outsourcing. Ball State Professor Michael Hicks, quoted in an Indianapolis Star article about Carrier’s plant closing, said 90 percent of manufacturing job losses are due to productivity increases.\\n\\nHe also said the other 10 percent was due to outsourcing. It’s true that, while global trade is generally good for America’s economy and for the average American, some studies have shown that in the short term it can have negative impacts on some groups of Americans by displacing jobs.\\n\\nFreedom Means Running Your Own Life\\n\\nIt’s not the government’s role to solve that problem. As Frederic Bastiat wrote in 1849, “Government is and ought to be nothing whatever but the united power of the people, organized, not to be an instrument of oppression and mutual plunder among citizens; but, on the contrary, to secure to every one his own, and to cause justice and security to reign.” A government’s principal role from a moral and just standpoint is to protect the rights of its citizens to live their lives in a free state. What we do with that freedom is up to us.\\n\\nMike Rowe, host of “Somebody’s Got to Do It,” wrote about getting fired from QVC and rejected by hundreds of gigs, noting that successes and failures are part of life:\\n\\nFrom 1984 to 1990, I auditioned for at least 500 jobs. I booked less than a dozen. That’s one ‘yes’ for every fifty ‘no’s.’ In 1993, after losing my steady job at QVC, (deservedly,) I returned to the freelance life. For the next eight years, I lived in New York and Hollywood, and auditioned for no less than two thousand gigs. I booked roughly three-hundred of those. In other words, I did very well. But along the way, I was rejected two or three times a week. That’s every week, for the better part of a decade. That’s a lot of rejection.\\n\\nLike Occupy’s Schultz and many recent college grads, Rowe missed out on a dream job earlier in his career: “The Daily Show.” After doing two rounds of auditions in two years, he was passed over both times—first for Craig Kilborn, then for Jon Stewart. But he wrote in 2015, “Reading it [the second rejection letter] today though, I can’t believe how lucky I was to have been rejected. It was a critical step in a long series of failures that got me to the sewer, where my redemption awaited, and a new level of job satisfaction that I frankly, never imagined.”\\n\\nWhen Rowe was fired, he didn’t ask government to step in and give him “his job” back. He didn’t have the president promising he wouldn’t face competition from Jon Stewart at auditions. Competition is the hallmark of capitalism.\\n\\nThere will be struggles in life. Maybe you might even think it is unfair at times. Life is not a cakewalk. But we must work hard to overcome adversity. Throughout history humans have shown exceptional fortitude to survive and prosper in circumstances much tougher than having to change jobs and move. People can and do find new jobs every day. It’s a mark of bad character to demand the fruits of other people’s labor rather than fulfilling your responsibility to support yourself.\\n\\nYou Can Get Yourself Employed\\n\\nSince at least 2012, new jobs have been created each month at a rate surpassing job separations. In December 2015, there were over 60,000 new job openings in both the construction and nondurable goods manufacturing industries. Even as 58.8 million people left a job in 2015, 61.4 million people began a new job.\\n\\nGovernment regulations increase the cost of hiring, taking around a third of every new employee’s salary off the top with taxes and red tape.\\n\\nBob Funk, the founder of leading employment company Express Employment Professionals, told the Wall Street Journal during the height of the recent recession, “Anyone who really wants a job in this country can have one.” Unfortunately, too many people aren’t willing to put in the work to find one. Sometimes that is as easy as showing up on time, being responsible, following directions, and passing a drug test, which Funk says are all you need to get a full-time U.S. job quickly. Other calculations show that if you work full-time you will not live in poverty. So, in other words, essentially every American is capable of supporting himself and his family.\\n\\nToo many people are “functionally unemployable,” Stephen Moore wrote of his interview with Funk, because they have chosen to not fulfill the basic job prerequisites of showing up on time, working steadily, and passing a drug test. Directors of temp agencies say between 10 and 25 percent of applicants they work with can’t even pass a drug test.\\n\\nState representatives in Ohio said some counties have tens of thousands of jobs open for months but “staying on unemployment or in a treatment program is often preferable to an out-of-work individual over gainful employment.”\\n\\n‘Staying on unemployment or in a treatment program is often preferable to an out-of-work individual over gainful employment.’\\n\\nIf some people feel overly discouraged about the prospects of finding a job, that could be because of a number of factors, including hurtful messages put out by media, society, and government. Politicians and groups have been proclaiming for years that government should be able to protect everyone, exaggerating the difficulty of finding a new job at the same time they exaggerate the capabilities of government.\\n\\nAt the same time, government regulations increase the cost of hiring, taking around a third of every new employee’s salary off the top with taxes and red tape. Wouldn’t it be nice to earn a third more than you currently do? Thank meddling politicians and the people who voted themselves a part of your wallet for the fact that you don’t. Finally, the education system isn’t doing a good job of preparing students or setting expectations for what is needed in the real world. As Rowe has said, “We’re churning out a generation of poorly educated people with no skill, no ambition, no guidance, and no realistic expectations of what it means to go to work.”\\n\\nForce Can’t Bring the Jobs Back\\n\\nTime magazine’s Martha C. White recently reported on the persistent large gap between many open positions and the skills of people looking for jobs who might otherwise fill them: “Jobs are going unfilled as a result, which hurts companies and employees. The annual global Talent Shortage Survey from ManpowerGroup finds that nearly 1 in 5 employers worldwide can’t fill positions because they can’t find people with soft skills” (such as showing up on time and following simple directions).\\n\\nTo wield the kind of power, unheard of in American history, to be able to compel a company to open shop in America would have disastrous consequences.\\n\\nBut now Trump says, “We’re gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries,” and “I will bring the jobs back,” and “I heard last night that Ford is moving back to the United States — they may not do that deal [which they decided to do in 2011]. I get credit for that.”\\n\\nTo wield the kind of power, unheard of in American history, to be able to compel a company to open shop in America would have disastrous consequences Trump doesn’t want voters to consider. Just as governments can use power for good, they are easily tempted towards self-interest, corruption, and abuse of the citizenry. Unlimited power entrusted in the hands of a megalomaniac, who considers himself the most important man in the world, who personally attacks companies and individuals he dislikes by name, could easily be used for ill against the leader’s enemies.\\n\\nEven just in terms of forcing companies to open shop in America, such actions would violate the rights of the owners and investors of corporations. As a businessman whose products were made overseas, surely Trump knows capitalists have rights, too, to invest as they see fit. No jobs exist naturally. They are only offered by companies. What kind of a company would want to ever hire anyone in America if government held them responsible for the perpetual employment of every single person they ever hired?\\n\\nPoliticians like Trump, Sanders, and Clinton promise something to us for nothing. But even in politics, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. If a politician doesn’t tell you who is going to be paying for something that is “free,” you ought to be scared.\\n\\nBastiat wrote that the idea of a government that claims to offer something for nothing “is chimerical, absurd, childish, contradictory, and dangerous. Those who parade it, for the sake of the pleasure of accusing all governments of weakness, and thus exposing them to your attacks, are only flattering and deceiving you, while they are deceiving themselves.”',\n",

Taking the overdone notes of \"selfish loner must experience life threatening peril to change\" and mixing them with every possible college stereotype, Happy Death Day cannot help but be everything it is expected to be and this is its strongest advantage. It just can\\'t resist being a thoroughly enjoyable horror romp from start to finish.\\n\\nTheresa AKA “Tree” is a self-centered party girl who is murdered by a masked killer en route to yet another party. She re-awakens on her birthday, reliving the same fateful day over and over again, forcing her to confront her personal demons in order to once and for all break her temporal curse and expose her killer\\'s identity. Scott Lobdell’s script keeps the twists and turns spinning within a kinetic vortex. Jessica Rothe\\'s Tree glides through each repeat, shedding layer after layer of shallowness to reveal a brilliant core of empowerment. While Bill Murray\\'s lovable rogue\\'s key to salvation lies in love, Rothe\\'s heroine has to fight at every turn and the film is best when everything takes a backseat to her smile inducing embrace of circumstance. Everything is neatly telegraphed, but it is her journey that provides most of the film\\'s magnetic viewing experience.\\n\\nRachel Matthews supports as Tree\\'s villainous Sorority president, a walking embodiment of every meme ever written on the subject. Israel Broussard stars as Tree’s possible love interest, but even this angle is sidelined for the main event. This is the double-edged sword of the film. On one hand, it could have been interesting to see Tree fatalistically indulge in her predicament, but Rothe, and Landon are having too much fun, and while this keeps everything within Happy Death Day at surface level, it is an above board, comfortably ridiculous place to find oneself. Toby Oliver lenses the film, keeping Rothe in almost every frame. While this tactic was nerve wracking in mother!, here it is yet another dollop of camp that only enriches the film\\'s slim running time. Each sequence is framed in a manner that allows the viewer to gain a new piece of the puzzle before Tree’s inevitable re-demise.\\n\\nThe perils of an Uber driver\\n\\nIn theaters tomorrow, Happy Death Day is a hilarious, cringe filled mixture of comedic horror and coming of age conventions.

Fred Buckman, formerly of Consumers Power, PacifiCorp and Shaw Group will replace Rick Wills as chairman of the board.\\n\\nA handful of teams around the world are pursuing fusion technology as a way to provide carbon-free power that produces little waste and has minuscule fuel requirements by recreating here on earth the fusion reaction that fuels the sun.\\n\\nThe task is anything but easy. The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project in France has already cost $14 billion and will not produce a full-blown fusion reaction until 2027. The project is run by a seven-nation consortium.\\n\\n“When it comes to innovation, bigger is not always better,” said Mowry, the newly appointed CEO. “You only need to look at the aerospace industry and the success that Elon Musk and his SpaceX startup have had in creating reusable rockets. NASA was unable to achieve that in half a century with tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars.”\\n\\nGeneral Fusion’s reactor works by containing hydrogen plasma fuel in magnetic suspension and then compressing it with an array of massive pistons, which pushes the temperature of the fuel to 150 million degrees Celsius. The trick is to create a fusion reaction — merging the nuclei of hydrogen atoms — that releases more energy than it takes to create.\\n\\nThe piston-based reactor is designed to create bursts of energy lasting thousandths of a second, rather than maintaining a continuous plasma reaction with enormous energy requirements like some larger projects.\\n\\n“When you look across the fusion landscape, there are some interesting ideas, but I have a tough time seeing how they translate into a practical power plant,” Mowry said. “General Fusion’s approach makes this more of a solvable problem.”\\n\\nHeat recovered from the bursts in the GF reactor is used to generate electricity in the same way as conventional nuclear power plants, but without the long-lasting radioactive waste.\\n\\nGeneral Fusion and its partners — including Chrysalix Energy, GrowthWorks Capital, Cenovus Energy, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and the sovereign wealth fund of Malaysia among others — have already sunk about $100 million into the project.\\n\\n“We are about to transition from a lab-scale type of development to an integrated prototype, a demonstration machine, so the company will step up to the next level and the financing we require will increase commensurately,” said Mowry.\\n\\nThe dollar value of the next round of financing will be determined as GF management “sharpens its pencils” and maps out the next stage of the engineering and development program over the next three to six months.\\n\\nrshore@postmedia.com',\n",

       " 'SpaceX has an announcement to make. Curiously, it chose to hide it in the fine print, but here goes...\\n\\nSpaceX is taking reservations for Mars.\\n\\nHold on a minute...\\n\\nYou may think that you\\'ve already heard this news before. One month ago (almost to the day), Elon Musk famously penciled in \"2018\" as the date SpaceX will launch its first Red Dragon space capsule to Mars. Specifically, the company will use its new Falcon Heavy lift vehicle to carry a specially designed Dragon 2 spacecraft to Mars, then land said capsule vertically on the Red Planet, firing SuperDraco thrusters to brake its descent.\\n\\nFrom that position, SpaceX\\'s Red Dragon would theoretically be able to relaunch from Mars, where the gravity is less than 38% of Earth normal, and return to Earth -- fuel permitting. (That\\'s not Musk\\'s plan, however. He\\'s running this mission himself, and paying out of pocket, just to collect information in preparation for subsequent manned and unmanned missions to Mars.)\\n\\nBut that\\'s not what we\\'re talking about today. Today, we\\'re following up on our review of SpaceX\\'s latest update to its space-launch price list, which came out earlier this month. As we discussed yesterday, the first and most obvious change that SpaceX made to its price list was a price increase of $800,000 on plain-vanilla Falcon 9 satellite launches to Earth geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). Prices are going up 1.3%, and cargo capacity is increasing 13.4%.\\n\\nThe more Earth-shaking -- or perhaps Mars-quaking -- change is this: SpaceX has added a new line item to its price list. It now publicly advertises the transportation of a \"payload to Mars\" as one of its \"capabilities & services.\"\\n\\nShipping and handling are extra\\n\\nSpaceX now charges $62 million to lift 5.5 metric tons of cargo to Earth GTO. Ninety million dollars will buy you transportation of up to eight metric tons to GTO. But now, SpaceX offers a third option: It says it can transport up to four metric tons of cargo to Mars aboard one of its Falcon 9 rockets -- or 13.6 mT aboard the new Falcon Heavy once that rocket begins operations.\\n\\nNote that SpaceX describes these capabilities in a line separate from its \"standard payment plan\" price of $62 million for a Falcon 9 launch, or $90 million for the Falcon Heavy. The company isn\\'t promising any specific price tag for the Mars launch service, and is not offering to send you, or anyone else, specifically, to Mars. The company is only offering to transport cargo at this time. But even so, it\\'s a unique service.\\n\\nIn every sense of the word\\n\\nI don\\'t use \"unique\" lightly. Right now, and probably for the foreseeable future, SpaceX really is the only private company advertising the capability to send payloads to Mars.\\n\\nGovernmental organizations such as NASA, the European Space Agency, the Soviet Union, and later Russia, have all sent landers to Mars. Some of them even landed intact. What SpaceX is promising to do, though, is send cargo to Mars -- say, a Mars rover of your choosing and building -- land it safely, and land it in a manner that could, conceivably, permit it to come back home again.\\n\\nAmong private companies, this truly is unique. Granted, other companies are following SpaceX\\'s lead in developing rockets that can launch, land, and then launch again. Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) is developing a reusable rocketship it calls ADELINE, which can launch into space, then fly back to land on an airstrip. Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), through their joint venture United Launch Alliance, are developing a system for landing rockets by deploying parachutes after reentry, then snagging the \\'chutes by helicopter and delivering them to the ground.\\n\\nWhat\\'s SpaceX\\'s endgame?\\n\\nBoth Airbus\\' idea and the one being floated (get it?) by Boeing and Lockheed Martin have merit in a terrestrial sense. Reusable rockets should enable cheaper launches of Earth satellites, because you wouldn\\'t be building an entirely new rocket for each launch, then throwing it away and building a new one for the next launch.\\n\\nReusable rockets will therefore make satellite launches much cheaper here on Earth -- but for SpaceX, that\\'s only a side benefit. The real objective is making Mars landings -- and Mars launchings -- possible.\\n\\nBut here\\'s the thing: Airbus\\' plan, and Boeing and Lockheed\\'s, as well, depends on the presence of an established infrastructure to support rocket relandings -- airstrips in Airbus\\' case; helicopters for Boeing and Lockheed. The problem is that both landing strips and helicopters are in pretty short supply on Mars. If you want to land there, and have any hope of relaunching, then SpaceX\\'s system is the only way to go.',\n",

       " 'Bing has been unceremoniously dumped by Facebook. The social network had been using the Microsoft search tool to power its Graph Search platform for some time now, but no longer. While no announcement has been made, Facebook confirmed the news to Reuters.\\n\\nThe lack of official announcement meant that the dropping of Bing was immediately noticed. Facebook does not have a replacement partner in mind -- there is no danger of the social network teaming up with Google -- but will go it alone instead.\\n\\nIt seems that the decision tied in with Facebook\\'s recent updating of its own search tool. A few days ago, the search tool was updated to make it possible to find specific posts rather than users and pages. This made Facebook Search more like a \"proper\" search engine, and probably led to questions about the value of maintaining links with Bing. But there are other reasons behind ditching Bing.\\n\\nFacebook issued a statement to VentureBeat in which it explained the switch in focus:\\n\\nWe\\'re not currently showing web search results in Facebook Search because we\\'re focused on helping people find what\\'s been shared with them on Facebook.\\n\\nWhile Microsoft will undoubtedly be unhappy with Facebook\\'s decision, it\\'s one that will probably go down well with users of the site. The move is an interesting one, if not one that is entirely surprising. The problem with using Bing to display web search results within Facebook was that it did just that -- display search results from the wider web rather than just Facebook.\\n\\nThis meant that while there was arguably a better experience for users thanks to the extra features, there was a far stronger risk that people would navigate away from Facebook and stop consuming ads. It\\'s not yet clear whether Facebook will start to cast its search net wider, displaying results and pages in a closely controlled built-in browser, but this is certainly something to look out for further down the line.\\n\\nPhoto credit: 1000 Words /Shutterstock',\n",
       " 'Liberals have a new word for what normal people call “success.” They call it “privilege,” as if a happy, prosperous life is the result of some magic process related to where your great-great-great-grandfather came from.\\n\\nIt’s the latest leftist argument tactic, which means it is a tactic designed to prevent any argument and to beat you into rhetorical submission. Conservatives, don’t play their game.\\n\\nIt’s easy to see that this notion that accomplishment comes not from hard work but from some mysterious force, operating out there in the ether, is essential to liberal thought. To excuse the dole-devouring layabouts who form so much of the Democrat voting base, it is critical that they undermine the achievements of those who support themselves. We can’t have the American people thinking that hard work leads to success; people might start asking why liberal constituencies don’t just work harder instead of demanding more money from those who actually produce something.\\n\\nThis “Check your privilege” meme is the newest trump card du jour on college campuses and in other domains of progressive tyranny. It morphed into existence from the “You racist!” wolf-cry that is now so discredited that it produces little but snickers even among liberal fellow travelers. After all, if everyone is racist – and to the progressives, everyone is except themselves – then no one is really racist. And it’s kind of hard to take seriously being called “racist” by adherents of a political party that made a KKK kleagle its Senate majority leader.\\n\\nSo how do we deal with this idiocy?\\n\\nThe proper response to the privilege gambit is laughter. The super-serious zealots of progressivism hate being laughed at, but there’s really no other appropriate response outside of a stream of obscenities. The privilege game is designed to circumvent arguments based on reason and facts and evidence, so the way to win it is to defeat it on its own terms.\\n\\nCall: “Check your privilege!”\\n\\nResponse: “What you call ‘privilege’ is just me being better than you.”\\n\\nThey won’t like it. It will make them angry. Good. Because tactics like “Check your privilege” are designed to make us angry, to put us off-balance, to baffle us and suck us down into a rabbit hole of leftist jargon and progressive stupidity.\\n\\nDon’t follow them. Mock them. Accuse them of adhering to a transphobic cisnormative paradigm and start shrieking “Hate crime!”\\n\\nDon’t worry about not making sense. They’re college students. They are used to not understanding what people smarter than they are tell them.\\n\\nRespectful argument should be reserved for those who respect the concept of argument. The sulky sophomores who babble about privilege do not. They only understand power. And we give them power when we give their nonsense the respect we would give a coherent argument.\\n\\nThey deserve only laughter. And to laugh at them, we simply need to refuse to be intimidated.\\n\\nThe plain fact is that what they understand to be “privilege” is really just what regular people understand is a “consequence.” It is a consequence of hard work, of delaying gratification and of sacrifice. No one came and bestowed this country upon us. We built it. Some of us died doing so. If we have privilege, it was earned at Bunker Hill, Gettysburg and Normandy. It’s not a function of skin tone or the number of vowels in your name; it’s a function of character.\\n\\nUnlike them, many of us have lived overseas, and often in rather bullet-rich environs. Our life experience consists of more than reading Herbert Marcuse and showing solidarity with oppressed Guatemalan banana pickers by boycotting Chiquita. What we have today in this country is not anything to be ashamed of or to apologize for, but to be proud of.\\n\\nTheir poisonous notion of privilege is really just another way for liberals to pick winners and losers based not upon who has won or lost in the real world, but upon who is useful and not useful to the progressive project at any given moment.\\n\\nThis is why you see young people descended from Holocaust survivors tagged as bearers of “privilege” when their tattooed, emaciated grand-parents landed here with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Others who grew up in luxury get to bear the label of “unprivileged” because ten generations ago some relative came from a particular continent.\\n\\nIt’s idiocy. It’s immoral. We need to say so. For too long we’ve put up with this silliness.\\n\\nWhat’s particularly amusing when you push back on these clowns is that they are so surprised to experience resistance to their petty fascism. Many of them, being the special snowflakes that they are, have never had anyone express to them the notion that they might be wrong. University administrators are too terrified of these whiny pipsqueaks to correct them.

       " 'NASA\\'s space shuttles have been an integral part of Canada\\'s space program, and how Canadian astronauts will get into space after they retire is still up in the air.\\n\\n\"For Canada, our flight heritage rests with the shuttle,\" said former Canadian astronaut Steve MacLean, president of the Canadian Space Agency.\\n\\nHe has flown on Atlantis, the shuttle set to blast off on its final flight at 11:26 a.m. ET Friday.\\n\\nSteve MacLean prepares for his 2006 Atlantis flight. He said access to space for Canadian astronauts will be reduced with the end of the shuttle program. ((Terry Renna/Associated Press)) Speaking to the media from Kennedy Space Centre in Florida on Thursday, the eve of the final launch of NASA\\'s space shuttle program, Maclean said the space shuttles carried 14 Canadians on 14 separate space missions over the past 25 years.\\n\\nThe space shuttles also allowed Canadian scientists to conduct experiments in space and Canadian engineers to contribute to space safety and technology through the use of the Canadarm robots attached to each shuttle.\\n\\nThe end of the program will definitely affect Canada, MacLean acknowledged.\\n\\n\"I think what\\'s going to change the most is our human access [to space] in Canada is going to be reduced,\" he said. But he noted that other nations will have the same problem.\\n\\nOnly 1 Canadian astronaut flight scheduled\\n\\nSo far, MacLean said, Canada has only one scheduled space flight after the end of the space shuttle program. Col. Chris Hadfield will head to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2012 and return in 2013 after serving as the space station\\'s first Canadian commander.\\n\\nThe Canadian Space Agency is in the process of negotiating future flights, MacLean said.\\n\\nIt is also involved in discussions with NASA, Europe and Russia about the future of human space travel.\\n\\n\"With the termination of the shuttle, we are at a crossroads. There are some decisions to be made about where the world goes next with respect to space,\" he said. \"This is a series of negotiations that Canada will be part of.\"\\n\\nIn the near future, Canada will likely depend on Russia to bring people, and Europe and Japan to bring equipment to the International Space Station, Maclean said. That may change the frequency of space flights by Canadian astronauts, he added.\\n\\nBut he said things could be different in four or five years, when NASA is expected to have built a new space vehicle.\\n\\nNASA is also planning to change its focus to services provided in orbit and rely increasingly on the commercial sector to take humans and cargo into orbit.\\n\\n\"I think that provides an opportunity for Canadian industry to participate,\" MacLean said.\\n\\nOn Friday, MacLean was set to watch Atlantis\\'s final launch, along with Industry Minister Christian Paradis and Gary Goodyear, Minister of State for Science and Technology.\\n\\nHe said he felt nostalgic when he saw the shuttle on the launch pad.\\n\\n\"I think that\\'s the mood that\\'s here today — it\\'s one of celebrating these last moments of an amazing program.\"',\n",
       " '\\n\\nSome bikes always seem to be customized in a certain way: Many of the CB750s and Bonnevilles we see are hard to tell apart.\\n\\nThe same type of cognitive inertia applies to Moto Guzzis, which often follow the style perfected by Kaffeemaschine. But here’s a very, very different Guzzi, from João Barranca of Redonda Motors.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão hails from Coimbra, Portugal, and runs his workshop after hours. This is the second Redonda build we’ve featured, after his amazing Metisse-inspired Husaberg, and we’re now wondering if it’s time he went pro.\\n\\nThis time around, João was in the mood for something Italian. So he sourced the Mille GT and got stuck in.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I always liked Italian motorcycles,” he tells us. “I think they are different from all others.” (The Mille GT is certainly different, being a short-lived, late 80s hybrid of the T5 and California.)\\n\\n“For me, an Italian motorcycle must have some fine lines, should have style, must be fast and invoke racing.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBack in the day, the Mille GT’s 948cc engine was specc’d at 67 hp. Adequate, but hardly exciting—so João decided to remedy this.\\n\\nHe started by lightening up the flywheel and upgrading the distribution system with a more modern version. It hasn’t really squeezed any more horses out of the Guzzi, but it’s changed how it behaves: “Now the engine gets up to speed very quickly—like a real race bike.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther improvements include a new set of Keihin FCR40 carbs, and an external oil filter kit to facilitate maintenance. The exhaust system is custom—meticulously designed for optimal performance and to “create beautiful bass.”\\n\\nThe bike’s a little easier to ride now too, thanks to a Hebo hydraulic clutch. And João’s gone to the trouble of rewiring it with modern components—like a Motogadget m-Unit, Dyna III ignition, a lithium-ion battery, new coils, and a new alternator and rectifier.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe suspension’s all new, with upside-down Showa forks up front, and a pair of Öhlins shocks out back. João retained the stock rear disc brake, but upgraded the front with 6-piston calipers, a Nissin radial pump and two 330mm discs.\\n\\nHe’s kept the stock 18-inch wheels too, for a classic feel, but fitted Maxxis Promaxx Street rubber, a high-performance bias ply design.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão’s done well to take the Mille GT from rundown beater to daily runner, but he’s given it a dash of style too. The bodywork is intriguing and spacious—this is a ‘Grand Tourer,’ after all.\\n\\nUp top is the original tank, modified for a racier effect, and fitted with dual filler caps as a nod to old endurance racers. New fenders at both ends complete the bodywork.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe front fairing/headlight combo is a little unconventional, but we still dig it. Behind it is a new speedo and a set of clip-ons.\\n\\nThe tailpiece is a one-off, made from fiberglass to match the tank’s proportions. Inspiration for the dual taillights came from Italian sports cars of the 80s.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Moto Guzzi is sprinkled with lovely details, and wrapped up with sublime paint and pinstriping.\\n\\n“The color scheme was inspired by the Moto Guzzi brand colors,” explains João, “but in different tones, in order to make the bike elegant and distinct.”\\n\\n\\n\\nElegant and distinct is right: this old Guzzi has all the right junk in all the right places. And these days, you can pick up a Mille GT for a couple of Gs—probably half the price of a decent Le Mans.\\n\\nNow that’s got us thinking …\\n\\nRedonda Motors | Facebook | Instagram | Images by Bernardo Lúcio',\n",

       " 'FORT MEADE, Md. -- Bradley Manning, the Army intelligence analyst who laid bare America\\'s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan by covertly transmitting a massive trove of sensitive government documents to WikiLeaks, has been convicted on 19 of 21 charges, including 6 counts of espionage. He was found not guilty of aiding the enemy, the most serious and controversial charge laid against him.\\n\\nAfter warning a courtroom packed with 30 spectators, almost all of them Manning supporters, that she would accept no disruptions, the judge overseeing his military court martial, Col. Denise Lind, rapidly delivered her verdict in a crisp voice.\\n\\nFor journalists watching the proceedings from a remote media room, there was no time to gauge Manning\\'s reaction before the military cut off a live feed from the courtroom.\\n\\nThe prosecution\\'s novel legal theory that Manning knew his disclosures to WikiLeaks, once published on the Internet, would wind up in al Qaeda\\'s possession could have had implications that extended beyond the fate of the 25-year-old Crescent, Okla., native.\\n\\nAlthough he had admitted the underlying fact of his disclosures to WikiLeaks, and to many of the lesser charges against him, the prosecution nonetheless went ahead with trying to prove Manning was guilty of aiding al Qaeda. Press freedom advocates had warned that if he was convicted on that count, the verdict would threaten to criminalize both journalists and their sources -- a possibility that still lingers on with the Espionage Act convictions.\\n\\nYochai Benkler, a Harvard professor who testified during the trial for the defense that WikiLeaks was seen as a legitimate news organization when Manning made his leaks, said \"the judge\\'s verdict on aiding the enemy was important for the future of national security journalism, but we still have to wait for a sentence.\"\\n\\nLeak-based reporting is increasingly becoming the only way to conduct serious investigative reporting, Benkler said. Manning now faces up to 136 years in prison on his convictions. If he is given a long term, Benkler said, Manning\\'s court martial will still serve as a stark warning for every source that they may have to pay a heavy price for revealing the secrets the government is keeping in their name.\\n\\n\"While we\\'re relieved that Mr. Manning was acquitted of the most dangerous charge, the ACLU has long held the view that leaks to the press in the public interest should not be prosecuted under the Espionage Act,\" said Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU\\'s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. \"Since Manning already pleaded guilty to charges of leaking information – which carry significant punishment – it seems clear that the government was seeking to intimidate anyone who might consider revealing valuable information in the future.\"\\n\\nThe verdict brings to a close the three-year period since Manning\\'s arrest in May 2010 that saw the private first class living in a state of limbo, subjected to conditions in solitary confinement that a UN investigator compared to torture. Even a term significantly shorter than the maximum punishment -- which judges rarely impose -- could mean he spends the rest of his life behind bars. The sentencing phase of the trial, which could feature significant testimony from both government and defense witnesses on the impact of Manning\\'s leaks, will begin Wednesday morning.\\n\\nTHE LEAKS\\n\\nWhen they were made public in 2010 and 2011, Manning\\'s leaks -- 391,832 battlefield reports from Iraq, 75,000 reports from Afghanistan, and 251,287 State Department Cables -- rocked the world with their details on the intimate doings of the Departments of Defense and State. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton protested the damage she said they had done to international relations, and once Manning was arrested in May 2010, the current chair of the House Intelligence committee suggested that he should face the death penalty.\\n\\nManning\\'s supporters include Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake, and Edward Snowden, whose leaks began to be published just three days after Manning\\'s trial started. Since his arrest Manning\\'s supporters have maintained that he\\'s \"a classic whistleblower,\" words Snowden has since used himself.\\n\\nIn his closing arguments defense attorney David Coombs singled out one leak in particular: the chilling video of a U.S. Apache helicopter gunship mowing down nine people in Iraq, including two Reuters journalists.\\n\\nThat file, he suggested, proves that Manning was a whistleblower reacting to horrible events on the ground -- not someone who wanted his leaks to wind up on the compound of Osama bin Laden, as they eventually did.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing in there that aids the enemy,\" said Lorna VanderZanden, an Arlington, Va., resident who rallied with about 30 other supporters in front of Fort Meade the morning of the verdict. \"What\\'s there is verification that our helicopter crews are operating out of bloodlust -- that they are killing needlessly.\"\\n\\nBut over the two-month course of the trial, the government offered a very different timeline of Manning\\'s motivation and leaks. Manning was not, Maj. Ashden Fein said, acting out a \"crisis of conscience.\" Instead, the prosecutor argued Manning sought out WikiLeaks -- and the hacker fame it could bring him -- almost as soon as he deployed to Iraq.\\n\\nManning was, in Fein\\'s words, a \"narcissist\" and a \"traitor.\"\\n\\nA government forensics expert testified that Manning created a text file with contact information for Julian Assange on November 29, 2009, just two weeks after he reached Forward Operating Base Hammer east of Baghdad on his deployment. Prosecutors claimed that Manning\\'s first transmission of classified information -- of encrypted video of an Afghanistan airstrike that killed scores of civilians -- occurred at the end of that month.\\n\\nAnd along the way, the government offered what prosecutor Cpt. Angel Overgaard called \"a mountain of circumstantial evidence\" to show that Manning knew his leaks would wind up in al Qaeda\\'s hands. Knowledge is a necessary element of the aiding the enemy charge, and it was the most contested during the first phase of the trial.\\n\\nCoombs countered the prosecution\\'s timeline and account of Manning\\'s knowledge of terrorists\\' use of the Internet with one of his own.\\n\\nThe leaks started later -- on December 31, 2009 -- in response to a chilling event, Coombs said. When a roadside bomb missed an American convoy on Christmas Eve but killed a member of an Iraqi family, Manning was the only one on his base not to celebrate. Deeply moved by the incident, Manning started sending WikiLeaks the Iraq and Afghanistan War Logs. And then, when members of his unit viewed the shocking \"Collateral Murder\" Apache video, Manning researched the incident and released the video.\\n\\nIn her decision Lind apparently accepted Coombs\\' timeline of events -- or at least decided there was not enough evidence to support the government\\'s version. Aside from aiding the enemy, the only other charge on which Manning was found not guilty was the first leak in the government\\'s chronology, that Afghanistan airstrike video.\\n\\nCoombs asked in his closing statement whether the evidence showed, as the prosecution had it, that Manning was \"a traitor, had no loyalty to this country or the flag and wanted to systematically harvest and download as much information as possible for his true employer, WikiLeaks.\" Or, he proposed, was his client a \"young, naive with good intentions soldier who had human life in his humanist beliefs center to his decisions, whose sole purpose was, maybe I just can make a difference, maybe this can make a change.\"\\n\\nCoombs\\'s closing argument there gestured toward his larger argument in the case -- that Manning saw himself as a whistleblower, and that his releases did not harm U.S. interests. But he was prevented by Lind\\'s orders from presenting evidence of Manning\\'s intent and the harm his leaks did or not cause during the merits phase of the trial. As sentencing begins, Coombs will be free to make those claims.\\n\\n\"There is an enormous amount of discretion on the sentence,\" said David Frakt, a visiting professor of military law at the University of Pittsburgh. \"There are no mandatory minimums ... and there are no guidelines of any kind.\"\\n\\nBefore the trial, former State Department spokesman Patrick Crowley warned that convicting Manning of aiding the enemy risked turning him into a \"martyr.\" Lind avoided that outcome on the most serious charge, but his several convictions on Espionage Act violations still carry potentially grave consequences for press freedom.\\n\\n\"I think [Lind] wanted to avoid setting some type of precedent that she would be looked down upon for, but the remaining charges she had no qualms about,\" said Nathan Fuller, a staff writer for the Bradley Manning Support Network. \"I don\\'t think this ruling bodes very well for [sentencing], but I am heartened to know that the defense will be allowed to make arguments that it was barred from making during the trial -- such as Manning\\'s good intentions ... and damage or lack thereof.\"\\n\\nIf Manning receives any prison time as a result of his convictions, his sentence will stand in stark contrast to that of the servicemembers who have been involved in alleged U.S. war crimes. After the 2005 Haditha killings in Iraq, where 24 unarmed people died, the only marine to be tried received a reduction in rank and a pay cut.\\n\\nWidney Brown, senior director of international law and policy for Amnesty International, said in a statement that the aggressive prosecution of Manning showed the military\\'s double standard on investigating incidents of its own misdeeds.\\n\\n\"The government’s priorities are upside down,\" Brown said. \"The U.S. government has refused to investigate credible allegations of torture and other crimes under international law despite overwhelming evidence. Yet they decided to prosecute Manning who it seems was trying to do the right thing – reveal credible evidence of unlawful behavior by the government.\"',\n",

The pair allegedly left their post and drove to Calvert Vaux Park in Brooklyn, according to WPIX.\\n\\nJust after 8 p.m., the officers conducted a car stop of an Infinity Coupe driven by an 18-year-old woman with two male passengers. There was a quantity of marijuana in the front seat cup holder. The officers instructed the three occupants to step out of the car and asked if they had any drugs on them, according to the investigation. The young woman responded she had marijuana and two Klonopin pills.\\n\\nThe detectives handcuffed the woman, told her she was under arrest and would be getting a desk appearance ticket. They let her companions go and instructed them to retrieve their friend from the precinct in three hours.\\n\\nAfter leaving the park, the officers allegedly instructed the young woman to call her friends and tell them not to follow the minivan.\\n\\nMartins allegedly told the young woman he and his partner are “freaks” and asked her what she wanted to do to get out of the arrest. Martins allegedly forced the handcuffed teen to perform a sex act on him while seated in the back seat of the van as Hall drove and watched through the rear view mirror. Martins then allegedly raped the victim.\\n\\nThe detectives then stopped the van in Bay Ridge, about four miles from the park in the opposite direction of where their team was located and switched places.\\n\\nMartins got behind the wheel and Hall got into the back seat of the van, where he allegedly forced the victim to perform a sex act on him. They then drove back to the vicinity of the 60th Precinct in Coney Island and had the victim call her friends again to tell them she was being let go. They also allegedly gave her back the Klonopin pills, told her to keep her mouth shut and released her.\\n\\nThe victim told her friends what happened and, later that evening was taken to Maimonides Hospital, where a sexual assault evidence collection kit was prepared. DNA recovered from the victim was a match to both of the defendants. Video surveillance shows the victim exiting the police van at approximately 8:42 p.m.\\n\\nThe defendants were arraigned Monday before Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun on a 50-count indictment in which they are charged with first-degree rape, first-degree criminal sexual act, second-degree kidnapping, official misconduct and related counts.\\n\\nMartins was ordered held on $250,000 bail and Hall was ordered held on $150,000 bail.

And the ubiquity of location-aware devices, such as in-car navigation systems and GPS-enabled cameras — and the large volume of publicly available map data — provide a wide variety of opportunities for building out Geographical Information Systems (GIS) that incorporate search to produce superior results for end users.\\n\\nUse of spatial information goes well beyond search, but in this article I\\'ll focus on how you can take advantage of spatial information to enhance your search application by leveraging the capabilities of Apache Lucene and Apache Solr. Why use a search engine? By no means is it a requirement, given that many good (even free) GIS tools are available. However, basing your application on search offers several powerful features where many other approaches traditionally fail. Search systems are effective at combining structured and unstructured data, enabling users to enter free-form queries that search free text such as descriptions and titles while restricting or altering the results based on geographical data. For instance, a travel site could implement a feature whereby a user can ask to find all hotels in Boston, Mass. with a 4-star rating and the phrase comfortable bed in the review text and 24-hour room service in the description — all with subsecond response. A search system such as Apache Solr can also provide faceting (see Related topics for information on Solr and facets), highlighting, and spell checking on the result set so that the application can help users find what they are looking for more effectively.\\n\\nI\\'ll start with a brief review of some key Lucene concepts, leaving the deeper details to the reader to research. Next, I\\'ll cover some of the basic concepts of geospatial search. GIS is a large field that could easily consume this entire article and many more, so I will instead focus on some basic concepts that should be fairly intuitive given the need to find services, people, and other items of interest on a daily basis. I\\'ll round out the article with some discussion of the approaches available for indexing and searching spatial information using Lucene and Solr. I\\'ll ground these concepts in a real, albeit simple, example using data from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project (see Related topics).\\n\\nRecalling key Lucene concepts\\n\\nApache Lucene is a Java™-based, high performance search library. Apache Solr is a search server that uses Lucene to provide search, faceting, and many more capabilities over HTTP. Both are licensed under the commercial-friendly Apache Software License. See Related topics for more information on the features and APIs that each offers.\\n\\nAt their heart, Solr and Lucene both represent content as a document. A document is then made up of one or more fields plus an optional boost value indicating the document\\'s importance. A field is made up of the actual content to be indexed or stored plus metadata telling Lucene how to handle that content and a boost value indicating that field\\'s importance. It is up to you to decide how to represent your content as documents and fields, depending on how you wish to search and otherwise access the information in the document. You can have a one-to-one relationship between a single unit of your content or a one-to-many relationship. For instance, I might choose to represent a single Web page as a document with several fields such as title, keywords, and body. Or, in the case of a book, I may choose to represent each page of the book as a separate document. As you will see later, this distinction is important when it comes to encoding spatial data for search. The content in a field can be indexed or just stored as is for use by an application. If the content is indexed, then the application can search it. Indexed content can also be analyzed to produce terms, often called tokens. A term is the basis for lookup and use in the search process. A term is often a word, but it need not be. I encourage you to explore the Related topics to learn more about all of these concepts.\\n\\nOn the query side of the coin, Lucene and Solr offer rich capabilities for expressing user queries, ranging from basic keyword (term) queries, to phrase and wildcard queries. Both Lucene and Solr also offer the ability to restrict the space being searched by applying one or more filters, which are key to spatial search. Range queries and range filters are among the essential mechanisms for restricting the space. In a range query (or filter), the user states the need to restrict all searched documents to be between two values that have a natural sorting. For instance, it is common to use a range query to find all documents that occurred last year or last month. Underneath the hood, Lucene must enumerate the terms in the documents to identify documents that fall within the range. As I\\'ll show later, setting this up effectively is one of the keys to performance for filtering in spatial-search applications.\\n\\nLucene and Solr also provide the notion of function queries, which allow you to use the value of a field, such as a latitude and longitude, as part of the scoring mechanism, instead of simply the internal collection statistics that comprise the primary scoring mechanism. This will also come into play later in the article, when I demonstrate using some of Solr\\'s distance-based functions.\\n\\nGeospatial search concepts\\n\\nFirst and foremost, when building a spatial search application, you need to identify the spatial data to be included in the application. This data often is in the form of some geocoded system such as latitude, longitude, and elevation, or as a ZIP code or a particular street address. The more formalized the system for encoding, the easier it will be to work within your system. For example, the old folk song \"Over the River and Through the Woods\" (you know the words: \"to Grandmother\\'s house we go\") encodes a fair amount of spatial information into the lyrics (see Related topics). But it isn\\'t all that useful in a GIS system, because we have no clue where the woods or the river are. Contrast that with detailed directions to Grandma\\'s that include a starting address and an ending address, and you get the picture of why properly encoded data is important. (Interestingly, systems that can extract and codify more-generic directions and geographic entities — for example, over the river or near the brown house — and reason about them can also be quite useful, but that discussion is beyond this article\\'s scope.)\\n\\nGoing beyond the raw, geocoded data used to identify locations, many GIS systems can add information that occurs relative to the physical locations. For instance, a navigation system may use a series of locations laid out in order on a map to create a route of travel from point A to point B. Or a meteorologist might overlay rainfall or severe-weather data across a map of an area and allow people to search for rainfall amounts by places of interest. People living near one another often group together areas to form ZIP codes, area codes, or even towns, cities, and states. In the case of OSM, users are allowed to edit and overlay information on top of the base map, such as places of interest or even streets. Combining these overlays to form relationships and tracking them over time can further produce incredibly dynamic and capable applications.\\n\\nRepresenting spatial data\\n\\nRegardless of the overlays or other information associated with one or more locations, search applications need a way to represent this data in an efficient manner. Although location information can be represented in several ways, I\\'ll focus on the ones pertinent to Lucene. First and foremost, many types of geospatial data can be represented in their \"raw\" format and work just fine with a search application. For example, Syracuse is a perfectly fine way of representing the city of Syracuse, and users typing Syracuse in the search box will find the documents containing Syracuse just like any other search term. The raw representation is, in fact, the most common way people represent named locations, such as cities, states, and ZIP codes. Do note, however, that although I use the phrase raw representation, you can still transform or normalize the data first. For instance, converting all mentions of New York to NY is often a perfectly reasonable thing to do.\\n\\nBefore I tell you about the representations that Lucene can use, it is important to understand that all representations must take into account the spatial reference that produced them (see Related topics). In the United States, the most common is the World Geodetic System, often abbreviated as WGS 84 (see Related topics). Although transformations are possible between some systems, it is best to have all of your data represented in a single system. From here on, I will assume a single system.\\n\\nNumeric spatial information such as latitude and longitude (lat/lon for short) is where the more interesting representations come into play in terms of search with Lucene and Solr. Latitude and longitude are usually expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds from the Prime Meridian (located in Greenwich, England) and usually require using a double (or more) for precision purposes. For instance, for the data included in my example — the city of Syracuse, N.Y., United States — is located around 76.150026 East (or -76.150026 if East is not specified) and 43.049648 North.\\n\\nDepending on the application, encoding every latitude and longitude can result in a large number of unique terms to be indexed. This isn\\'t necessarily a show stopper, but it can slow down search significantly, and, as you\\'ll see later in this article, it isn\\'t always needed. In fact, many mapping applications only care about bounding the search within a specific area, so storing approximate information about the location often yields far fewer terms without adversely affecting the search results. This precision-tradeoff approach often captures latitude and longitude into (Cartesian) tiers. You can think of each tier as a zoom level on a specific part of a map, such that tier 2 centered over the United States likely encompasses all of North America, while tier 19 is likely in someone\\'s backyard. More specifically, each tier divides the map into 2tier # boxes, or grids. Each box can then be given a number and indexed onto the document. I\\'ll explain in a later section how to leverage this information for faster searches.\\n\\nLatitude and longitude in Lucene terms are often represented as two different fields, but this can, in some applications, have implications for performance. If a single field is desired, lat/lon can be encoded into a single String using the Geohash encoding (see Related topics). Geohashes have the benefit of arbitrary precision by stripping off characters from the end of the hash. In many cases, locations that are near each other have common prefixes. For instance, entering Syracuse, NY into geohash.org yields the hash dr9ughxjkrt4b , whereas entering the Syracuse suburb of Cicero, NY yields the hash dr9veggs4ptd3 , both sharing the dr9 prefix.\\n\\nSo far, I\\'ve dealt specifically with points, but many geospatial applications are also interested in shapes, routes, and other relationships within the data. These are beyond the scope of what is available in Lucene and Solr; see Related topics for more information on these concepts.\\n\\nCombining spatial data with text in search\\n\\nOnce data is represented in an index, search applications typically have at least five basic needs when it comes to interacting with the data:\\n\\nDistance calculation : Given a point, calculate the distance to one or more other points.\\n\\n: Given a point, calculate the distance to one or more other points. Bounding-box filter : Find all matches (documents) that occur within some specific area.\\n\\n: Find all matches (documents) that occur within some specific area. Sorting : Sort the results for a search by the distance from some fixed point.\\n\\n: Sort the results for a search by the distance from some fixed point. Relevancy enhancement : Use the distance as a boost factor in the score while allowing other factors to play a role too.\\n\\n: Use the distance as a boost factor in the score while allowing other factors to play a role too. Query parsing: Given an address or some other user specification of a location, create an encoded representation that can be used to search against the indexed data.\\n\\nEach of these pieces can play an important role in location-based applications, but for now I\\'ll focus on distance calculations, bounding-box filtering, and query parsing. Sorting and relevancy enhancement (boosting) just use the distance calculations, and I\\'ll show how they play out in practice later in the article.\\n\\nDistance calculations\\n\\nWhen calculating distances for use in GIS applications, it is important to understand there are many different approaches, each with its own merits and demerits. Distance calculations can be split into three groups, depending on how an application chooses to model the Earth. In some cases, it is perfectly acceptable to assume a flat model of the Earth and lose some accuracy in exchange for speed. In the flat-model approach, most distance calculations come down to variations on the Pythagorean theorem. The flat-model approach is often good enough when distances are short and locations are not near the poles. In other cases, a spherical model is used, and the primary distance calculation used is the great-circle distance (see Related topics). The great-circle distance calculates the shortest distance between any two points on the surface of a sphere. The spherical model is better-suited when distances are further apart and more accuracy is needed. Finally, an ellipsoidal model of the Earth can be used along with the Vincenty formula (see Related topics) to obtain highly accurate distances (down to 0.5 millimeters) on the ellipsoid, but for most applications the complexity of this calculation is probably not worth it.\\n\\nGive an inch, take a mile In many local-search applications, the need for accuracy depends on the application. In some cases, being off by a mile is no big deal, while in other cases being off by even a few millimeters can matter. For example, the Euclidean distance is often not accurate enough for spanning larger distances (say between two states), and even the Haversine (great-circle) approach may not be accurate enough in some cases, because the Earth is better modeled as an ellipsoid and not a sphere. In those cases, using Vincenty\\'s formula may make more sense. In other applications, the only thing that matters is the ordering of the results, so something like the Squared Euclidean Distance (which isn\\'t really a distance) can be used, thus saving a square-root calculation.\\n\\nOf course, other distances are often useful as well, such as the Manhattan distance, which reflects the distance when one travels through a city laid out in blocks (as in a cab traveling through Manhattan in New York City). For the purposes of this article, I will demonstrate distances using the flat-Earth model and the great-circle distance and leave the rest to you to explore. Also note, I am disregarding elevation as a factor here, but some applications may need to account for it. For more information on geographic distances, see Related topics.\\n\\nBounding-box filter\\n\\nIn many location-based applications, millions of pieces of location data are available to be searched. Iterating through all of this data just to find the set of documents that both contain the keywords of interest and are within some distance of the user\\'s specified location would be extremely time-consuming. Naturally, it makes sense to narrow down the set of documents first and then evaluate the relevant subset. If only latitude and longitude information was stored, then the primary option for narrowing down the document set is by passing in the ranges that encompass the area around the location. This can be visualized as in Figure 1, where the slightly opaque box represents a bounding box around the downtown area of Charleston, S.C.:\\n\\nFigure 1. Example of a bounding box centered on downtown Charleston, S.C.\\n\\nIf the application also uses tier information or Geohash information, then these values can be used for better narrowing down the number of documents to search. I will demonstrate this later when discussing the specifics of indexing and searching with Lucene and Solr.\\n\\nQuery parsing\\n\\nQuery parsing comes down to determining which part of the query contains keywords to search for and which part contains location information. The latter part of this process is called geocoding (see Related topics). While I will discuss geocoding here in the context of query parsing, it is also useful during indexing. Consider the following examples of user queries:\\n\\n1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington, DC\\n\\n1 Washington Av. Philadelphia Pennsylvania\\n\\nMall of America, 60 East Broadway Bloomington, MN 55425\\n\\nRestaurants near Mall of America\\n\\nRestaurants in the Mall of America\\n\\nExamining the first two queries raises a few interesting points:\\n\\nOrder of terms is almost always important, whereas in pure text-based search, order may not be important.\\n\\nGazetteers and other spatial resources like GeoNames (see Related topics) can be quite useful in converting addresses to locations. These resources often contain lists of places of interest — for example, landmarks such as the White House.\\n\\nIt is important either to normalize abbreviations such as Ave. and DC or to use synonyms to cover the variety of ways users input address information.\\n\\nThe remaining queries illustrate several other subtleties. For instance, in the third query, the user has specified a full address; care must be taken to parse out the name, address, city, state, and ZIP properly if you are going to search against fields for each of those properties. In the last two queries, the subtle difference between the user\\'s choice of near versus in is likely important. Any restaurant within some distance of the Mall would suit the fourth query\\'s user, whereas the last query\\'s user is only interested in results inside the Mall. Query parsing can be quite difficult because of the complexity of describing topics in relation to location, not to mention spelling mistakes, language ambiguity, and bad data.\\n\\nDespite all the complexities of geocoding, services are available that translate addresses to location. Two commonly used services are the Google Maps public API and GeoNames (see Related topics). Unfortunately, using such Web services subjects you to their terms of use (which often include usage limits) and Internet traffic concerns. For real production systems, you are likely better off implementing your own capabilities. Although such an implementation is beyond this article\\'s scope, keep in mind that the GeoNames data is all freely downloadable, as are many other spatial resources, such as the CIA Factbook (see Related topics). Given good resources, it is best to build up from the basics (address, city, state) and then include places of interest and robust exception handling. Over time, your query logs will prove invaluable in creating a robust query parser that gracefully handles whatever users throw at it. As with any search application, keep in mind it is reasonable to make a best guess while also asking the user for clarification, as can be seen in the Google Maps screen capture in Figure 2:\\n\\nFigure 2. Best guesses and a request for user clarification on Google Maps\\n\\nFor this article, I will demonstrate a basic query parser that uses the GeoNames service and has a few other features, but I\\'ll leave it to the reader to implement a production-ready version. At this point, you should have enough background to get started. Thus, the remainder of the article will focus on how to index and search spatial information using Lucene and Solr.\\n\\nInstalling the sample code\\n\\nIn order to run the sample code, you need installations of the following:\\n\\nYou also need this article\\'s sample code (see Download), which includes a copy of Apache Solr and its dependencies. Follow these steps to install the sample code:\\n\\nunzip sample.zip cd geospatial-examples ant install Launch Solr: ant start-solr (to stop Solr later, run ant stop-solr ) Point your browser at http://localhost:8983/solr/admin and confirm that Solr started up properly. You should see a basic admin screen with a box to run queries in.\\n\\nOnce you have Solr up and running, you\\'re ready to take the first steps with spatial data in Lucene. Running the install step will download some sample data generated from the OSM project, which I\\'ve set aside at http://people.apache.org/~gsingers/spatial/. For this article, I\\'ve included sample OSM data from four locations within the United States that are of interest to me (permalinks to OSM are listed in the files):\\n\\nSyracuse, N.Y.\\n\\nDowntown Minneapolis, Minn.\\n\\nAround the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.\\n\\nDowntown Charleston, S.C.\\n\\nTo demonstrate many of the concepts in this article, I\\'ve written code to index the OSM data into Solr, and to associate some simple facts with specific locations (for example, see the syracuse.facts file in the data directory.) The goal of this effort is to show how unstructured text and spatial data can be combined to create effective search applications. Note also that I am using the Solr 1.5-dev version (the current development trunk for Solr), not the recently released Solr 1.4.\\n\\nIndexing spatial information in Lucene\\n\\nLucene 2.9 added two new features that play an important role in spatial search. First, Lucene has implemented better numeric-range querying and filtering capabilities, which are often used for bounding-box approaches. Second, Lucene has a new contrib module containing the stand-alone project formerly called Local Lucene (see Related topics). (The code lives in contrib/spatial of Lucene; I\\'ve included the JAR file with the sample code.) The spatial contrib offers tools for creating Cartesian tiers and Geohash codes, as well as tools for creating Lucene query and filter objects.\\n\\nBefore you look at the code that indexes the data, it is important to assess how you expect to interact with the data and how much data you have to deal with in your application. For instance, for most people with a small to moderate number of documents (say, fewer than 10 million), indexing latitude and longitude and using simple numeric range queries will likely yield sufficient performance, whereas larger applications may need to do more specific things (such as add Cartesian tiers) to reduce the number of terms and documents to be filtered and scored. It is also important to think about which format to store the information in. Many spatial distance algorithms require the numbers to be in radians, while others can work with degrees. Thus, it may be worthwhile to convert your lat/lon values to radians during indexing instead of having to convert them over and over during search time. The trade-off, of course, is more space (disk and, possibly, memory) if you need both formats. Finally, are you going to be faceting, sorting, and scoring on the location features, rather than just use them for filtering? If so, then you may need alternate representations as well.\\n\\nBecause this article is just demonstrating the concepts and is not intended for production use, I will show how to index Geohash, Cartesian tiers, and latitude and longitude all in one place, in some sample Java code. To get started, I\\'ve defined a number of values in the Solr schema (located in geospatial-examples/solr/conf/schema.xml) to capture the OSM data. The primary fields for location are shown in Listing 1:\\n\\nListing 1. Sample Solr schema\\n\\n<!-- Latitude --> <field name=\"lat\" type=\"tdouble\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <!-- Longitude --> <field name=\"lon\" type=\"tdouble\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <!-- lat/lon in radians In a real system, use a copy field for these instead of sending over the wire --> <field name=\"lat_rad\" type=\"tdouble\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <field name=\"lon_rad\" type=\"tdouble\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <!-- Hmm, what about a special field type here? --> <field name=\"geohash\" type=\"string\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <!-- Elevation data --> <field name=\"ele\" type=\"tfloat\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/> <!-- Store Cartesian tier information --> <dynamicField name=\"tier_*\" type=\"double\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\"/>\\n\\nLucene and Solr Although I am using the Solr schema to demonstrate the fields to index, all concepts here are easily available in Lucene as well. For instance, a tdouble is just Lucene 2.9.1 speak for a NumericField with a precision step of 8.\\n\\nI am storing the lat/lon values as tdouble fields. A tdouble is a double represented internally using a Trie structure. It can then be used by Lucene to significantly reduce the number of terms that need to be evaluated during range calculations (bounding box), despite the fact that it actually adds more terms to the index. I\\'m storing the Geohash as a simple string (unanalyzed) because I just want to do exact match on it. Elevation, although strictly not needed for the kinds of calculations I\\'m doing, is stored as a tfloat , which is just a float stored in the Trie structure. Finally, the tier_* dynamic field allows the application to add Cartesian tier fields dynamically without needing to predeclare each one. I will leave it to you to explore the other metadata fields captured by the indexing process.\\n\\nThe code responsible for indexing the data is located in the source tree in the sample.zip file. The Driver class is a command-line utility for launching the indexing process, and the actual indexing takes place as part of a SAX ContentHandler implementation named OSMHandler . Within the OSMHandler code, the key lines of interest are in the startElement() method. I\\'ll break it out into three sections. The first example, shown in Listing 2, indexes the latitude and longitude as double s and also converts them to radians for indexing:\\n\\nListing 2. Sample indexing of latitude/longitude\\n\\n//... current is a SolrInputDocument double latitude = Double.parseDouble(attributes.getValue(\"lat\")); double longitude = Double.parseDouble(attributes.getValue(\"lon\")); current.addField(\"lat\", latitude); current.addField(\"lon\", longitude); current.addField(\"lat_rad\", latitude * TO_RADS); current.addField(\"lon_rad\", longitude * TO_RADS);\\n\\nIndexing lat/lon is pretty straightforward. Next, I index the Geohash value for the lat/lon pair, as demonstrated in Listing 3:\\n\\nListing 3. Sample indexing of Geohash\\n\\n//... //See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash String geoHash = GeoHashUtils.encode(latitude, longitude); current.addField(\"geohash\", geoHash);\\n\\nIn the Geohash code in Listing 3, I am using the GeoHashUtils.encode() (there\\'s an equivalent decode() method) method that comes with the Lucene spatial contrib package to convert the lat/lon pair to a single Geohash string, which I then add to the Solr. Finally, to add Cartesian tier support, I did two things in the OSMHandler code:\\n\\nIn the constructor, I set up n instances of the CartesianTierPlotter class, one for each tier that I wish to index.\\n\\ninstances of the class, one for each tier that I wish to index. In the startElement() method, I looped over the n plotters and got the identifier for each grid element that contains the latitude and longitude of the current OSM element. The code for this looks like Listing 4: Listing 4. Sample indexing of Cartesian tiers //... //Cartesian Tiers int tier = START_TIER; //4 //Create a bunch of tiers, each deeper level has more precision for (CartesianTierPlotter plotter : plotters) {current.addField(\"tier_\" + tier, plotter.getTierBoxId(latitude, longitude)); tier++; }\\n\\nTypically, a query need only go against one tier at a time, so having multiple tiers usually does not pose a problem. You should pick the number of tiers you need based on how fine-grained you want to make your search. If you take the time to look through the rest of the indexing code, you will see I added a variety of other metadata values related to the data points in the OSM files. I am currently indexing only two OSM data types: a node and a way. A node is simply a location at a specific latitude and longitude, while a way is a combination of nodes that are all somehow related, such as a street. (See the OSM Data Primitives link in Related topics to learn more about the OSM files.)\\n\\nWhat\\'s a ? The CartesianTierPlotter \\'s job is to take a projection of the Earth (in my case, I use a Sinusoidal projection; see Related topics) and the lat/lon information, convert it down into the grids used by the tier system, and give each grid cell a unique number. During search, an application can then specify the grid IDs to restrict the search to find results in.\\n\\nNow that you have an understanding of the basics of creating a Solr document that contains spatial information, it just needs to be executed. The Driver class takes in the data and fact files plus the URL where Solr is running, and hands off the work to the OSM2Solr class. The OSM2Solr class then uses Solr\\'s Java client, SolrJ, to take the documents created by the OSMHandler SAX parser and sends them in batches to the Solr server. You can run the Driver class on your own using the command line, or you can simply run ant index and Ant will do the necessary work to run the driver. When you are done, point your browser at http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=*:* and verify that Solr found 68,945 documents. Take a moment to peruse the returned results and familiarize yourself with the content.\\n\\nI have only scratched the surface of the myriad of ways you could slice and dice the OSM data, but it is time to move on to discuss how to leverage this data in an application.\\n\\nSearching by location\\n\\nNow that I have data in the index, it\\'s time to revisit the different ways to use it. Namely, I am going to demonstrate how to sort, boost, and filter documents based on spatial information in the index.\\n\\nDistance-related calculations\\n\\nBoosting and sorting documents by distance is a common requirement for many spatial applications. To that end, Lucene and Solr come with several capabilities for calculating distances (see Related topics). Lucene includes tools for sorting and filtering based on the great circle (Haversine) formula (see DistanceUtils and DistanceFieldComparatorSource ), while Solr has several FunctionQuery functions for calculating distances, including:\\n\\nGreat circle (Haversine and Geohash Haversine)\\n\\nEuclidean and Squared Euclidean\\n\\nManhattan and other p-norms\\n\\nBoosting by distance is quite easy using Solr\\'s distance functions. I\\'ll focus on Solr\\'s function queries because they are the easiest to use and require no programming to leverage, but they can easily be used in or ported to Lucene.\\n\\nAs I showed earlier, I have several fields set up to store OSM data, including lat/lon , lat_rad/lon_rad , and geohash . I can then search and boost on these values:\\n\\nhsin (great circle): http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=name:Minneapolis AND _val_:\"recip(hsin(0.78, -1.6, lat_rad, lon_rad, 3963.205), 1, 1, 0)\"^100\\n\\n(great circle): dist (Euclidean, Manhattan, p-norm): http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=name:Minneapolis AND _val_:\"recip(dist(2, lat, lon, 44.794, -93.2696), 1, 1, 0)\"^10 0\\n\\n(Euclidean, Manhattan, p-norm): 0 sqedist (Squared Euclidean): http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=name:Minneapolis AND _val_:\"recip(sqedist(lat, lon, 44.794, -93.2696), 1, 1, 0)\"^100\\n\\n(Squared Euclidean): ghhdist (Geohash Haversine): http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=_val_:\"recip (ghhsin(geohash(44.79, -93), geohash, 3963.205), 1, 1, 0)\"^100\\n\\nIn each of these cases, I\\'ve combined a keyword query with a distance-based FunctionQuery to produce a result set that factors in both the keyword score and the distance score. To see the effect of each of these parts, add an &debugQuery=true onto each query and take some time to examine the explanations produced by Solr. These are just examples of their usage. To see the full signatures and documentation for these and other FunctionQuery functions, see Related topics. Of course, you may choose to boost one part over the other, or otherwise change the calls to fit your needs.\\n\\nAs for sorting by distance, Solr offers one primary option, which really is a bit of a workaround to the fact that Solr does not yet have sort-by-function capabilities and the fact that no custom FieldType s are defined at this point. However, the workaround is simple. To sort by function, create your query as above, but zero out, via boost, the keyword clause, as in q=name:Minneapolis^0 AND _val_:... . This will cause the keyword score to be zero (but the matching documents will still be returned) and the function value to be the sole component of the score. Longer term, look for Solr to add FieldType s for better support of sorting without needing to zero out the main query.\\n\\nWith the sorting and scoring out of the way, it\\'s time to move on to filtering.\\n\\nFiltering\\n\\nTo filter by location with Solr, the three primary mechanisms in Table 1 are available to application writers for restricting the document space:\\n\\nTable 1. Approaches to filtering\\n\\nFilter approach Description Example Range Create a range filter that encompasses the lat/lon of the bounding box. For performance reasons, it is important to use the TrieField ( NumericField ) capabilities of Solr with this approach. http://localhost:8983/solr/ select/?q=*:*&fq=lon:[-80 TO -78]&fq=lat:[31 TO 33] Cartesian tier Given a lat/lon and a distance, identify the grid cells surrounding the center point and restrict to only those documents containing those cells. See What\\'s a QParserPlugin? for more details on the source implementation of this. http://localhost:8983/solr/ select/?q=*:*&fq={!tier x=32 y=-79 dist=50 prefix=tier_} Distance Using Solr\\'s frange (function range) QParserPlugin capability and a distance function (more in Distance-related calculations, above), determine the distance between the points and restrict the document space. http://localhost:8983/solr/ select/?q=*:*&fq={!frange l=0 u=400}hsin(0.57, -1.3, lat_rad, lon_rad, 3963.205)\\n\\nA few words on density The density of data in a specific range often plays an important role in the user search experience. For example, an application providing business search for Manhattan in New York, N.Y. is much denser than one providing results for Buffalo, Minn. (see Related topics). In fact, it can be useful to incorporate this information into your filtering function such that the application picks an effective distance to ensure good results. Unfortunately, demonstrating how to do this is beyond this article\\'s scope.\\n\\nWhich approach is right for you? It will depend on the density of your points (see A few words on density), but a good recommendation is to start off with the simple range approach and then move up to the tier approach if need be. The key factor is to look at the number of terms that need to be evaluated at any one time when calculating the range, because that number is what directly controls how much work Lucene must do in order to restrict the result set.\\n\\nA simple geonames.org query parser\\n\\nBuilding a full-fledged query parser for spatial is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, I\\'ll build a simple QParserPlugin that will handle the chores of obtaining results from location information from GeoNames. This parser assumes that an application can split up the user input ahead of time into two parts: the keyword query and the spatial query. In fact, many local search applications ask the user for input in just this way via two input boxes.\\n\\nWhat\\'s a ? A QParserPlugin is Solr-speak for a query parser plug-in module. Just as many pieces of Solr are pluggable, so to are query parser implementations. For this article, I am using three different query parser plug-ins, one that comes with Solr — FunctionRangeQParserPlugin ({!frange}) — and two I wrote: CartesianTierQParserPlugin ({!tier}) and the GeonamesQParserPlugin . The source for the two plug-ins is located under the src tree in the sample download. Both plug-ins are already configured in Solr via the solrconfig.xml file: QParserPlugin s are invoked in the query by specifying {!parserName [parameters]}[query] , (parameters and query may be optional), as in {!tier x=32 y=-79 dist=50 prefix=tier_} and {!frange l=0 u=400}hsin(0.57, -1.3, lat_rad, lon_rad, 3963.205) .\\n\\nThe parser can take several parameters:\\n\\ntopo : Short for toponym (see the GeoNames documentation). The location to search for in GeoNames. Required.\\n\\n: Short for toponym (see the GeoNames documentation). The location to search for in GeoNames. Required. rows : The number of rows to get back from GeoNames. Optional. Default is 1.\\n\\n: The number of rows to get back from GeoNames. Optional. Default is 1. start : The result to start on. Optional. Default is 0.\\n\\n: The result to start on. Optional. Default is 0. lat : The latitude field name to use as a ValueSource for the FunctionQuery . If specified, lon must also be set.\\n\\n: The latitude field name to use as a for the . If specified, must also be set. lon : The longitude field name to use as a ValueSource for the FunctionQuery . If specified, lat must also be set.\\n\\n: The longitude field name to use as a for the . If specified, must also be set. gh : The Geohash field name to use as a ValueSource for the FunctionQuery . If specified, lat / lon must not be set.\\n\\n: The Geohash field name to use as a for the . If specified, / must not be set. dist : The distance function to use. String . One of [hsin, 0-Integer.MAX_VALUE, ghhsin] . If a geohash field is specified, then this field is disregarded and ghhsin is automatic. Default is 2 for the 2-norm (Euclidean).\\n\\n: The distance function to use. . One of . If a field is specified, then this field is disregarded and is automatic. Default is 2 for the 2-norm (Euclidean). unit - KM|M : The units to use, KM for metric, M for English. Default is M .\\n\\n: The units to use, for metric, for English. Default is . boost - float : The amount to boost the function query by. Default is 1.\\n\\nThe code for this example is in GeonamesQParserPlugin.java in the sample download. (The Solr server is already configured in the Solr version included in the download.) Invoking it is much like invoking the CartesianTierQParserPlugin outlined above. For instance, to search for malls in the index relative to Bloomington, Minn., I did http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?q=text:mall AND _query_:\"{!geo topo=\\'Bloomington, MN\\' lat=lat_rad lon=lon_rad dist=hsin}\" .\\n\\nBy taking the QParserPlugin approach, I was able to focus in on handling just the specific syntax that was important to me while location-wise still allowing all the text-based query parsing capabilities to proceed as usual.\\n\\nFrom here, the GeonamesQParserPlugin could be expanded significantly to work with postal codes and many other location specifications. Naturally, it also needs more error handling and likely needs to be converted to use the GeoNames dataset (see Related topics) so that it doesn\\'t rely on Web services calls. Solr also has an open issue in its issue tracker for adding spatial query parser support (see Related topics).\\n\\nWhere to next?\\n\\nI\\'ve demonstrated Lucene and Solr\\'s capabilities for searching, sorting, and filtering text documents based on a point-based model of location. From here, a real local-search application will need to investigate how best to scale, handle user queries, and visualize the results. For scaling, some of the question is answered by how many terms need to be enumerated when the bounding-box filter is created. Beyond the filter question for scaling, the usual search-related factors will apply, such as whether to distribute the index or simply replicate. See the Lucene and Solr Related topics.\\n\\nIf you are interested in building out a more significant GIS application, you will need to add much more sophisticated capabilities for route finding, shape intersection, and a great deal more. But if you need to build out a solid search application that combines the structure of point-based locations with unstructured text, then look no further than Lucene and Solr.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nSpecial thanks to fellow Lucene/Solr committers Ryan McKinley and Yonik Seeley for their insights and review of this article.\\n\\nDownloadable resources\\n\\nRelated topics',\n",

       " 'There is a “shadow banking” system that has massively and often unknowingly leveraged client assets into possibly the largest credit bubble the world has ever seen. Because of more favorable rules, much of the leverage has occured in the Euro, meaning a collapse of the Euro will be much more catastrophic than the public is aware.\\n\\nOne of the shadow banking systems favorite tools is re-hypothocation. This means institutions can use client funds as collateral for the institutions own investments. The institutions take $1 of client collateral and use it to purchase $1.40 to $2.00 of investments for the institution. So for $1 of client money, the client may be trading at leverage, and the institution is trading at leverage.\\n\\nA much more thorough explantion is provided by Reuters, who concludes\\n\\nThe volume and level of re-hypothecation suggests a frightening alternative hypothesis for the current liquidity crisis being experienced by banks and for why regulators around the world decided to step in to prop up the markets recently. To date, reports have been focused on how Eurozone default concerns were provoking fear in the markets and causing liquidity to dry up. Most have been focused on how a Eurozone default would result in huge losses in Eurozone bonds being felt across the world’s banks. However, re-hypothecation suggests an even greater fear. Considering that re-hypothecation may have increased the financial footprint of Eurozone bonds by at least four fold then a Eurozone sovereign default could be apocalyptic.\\n\\nFor further reading we suggest this dire post from zerohedge.com, who sees truly frightening possiblities\\n\\nIt turns out the next AIG was among us all along, only because it was hidden\\n\\ndeep in the bowels of the unmentionable shadow banking system, out of sight (by\\n\\ndefinition) meant out of mind.

Governments don’t have the money, so they will print it up via the central banks.

       " 'Snapchat Is at It Again and Blocks Root Users — but for How Long?\\n\\nDespite many security concerns from the past, Snapchat is still one of the most popular social media service available for smartphones. According to reports, it has 100 million of active users, and 65% of them upload photos.\\n\\nSnapchat users would easily become the 13th biggest country in the world if we take population as a measure.\\n\\nSnapchat’s fast way of sharing photos to multiple friends at the time is highly regarded by users. However, many of you, Snapchat users will soon face, if not already, a serious inconvenience, as Snapchat will stop working on your devices. Yes, Snapchat will not work on rooted devices.\\n\\nThe newest update brings a new security check. The application is now looking for superuser existence in the system upon logging in. A nice explanation of the problem was made by XDA Senior Member MaaarZ, who is also a creator of Snapprefs, an Xposed Framework module which enhances the limited Snapchat’s utility. According to MaaarZ, Snapchat is now performing a few tests and if at least one of them is positive, an application kills itself when Superuser is found in the system. Needless to say that most of currently available custom ROMs on XDA contain root, so this change may affect thousands if not millions of people.\\n\\nLooking from user’s perspective, the security should always be kept at the highest level. Blocking application on rooted devices is nevertheless an extremely poor move. Thousands of users will look for an alternative instead of keeping their devices in vanilla state. The social media market is very tight and it’s extremely easy to find a nice replacement without such ridiculous obstacles. I bet that many developers or companies are looking forward to delivering a similar, better-written software alternative with all users in mind, which will fill the gap in no time.\\n\\nI’m not a security expert, so I’ve asked our very own Senior Recognized Developer pulser_g2 to share his opinion regarding this move. Here’s what he had to say:\\n\\nAny application which tries to enforce client-side security, as part of its core use-case, is fundamentally flawed. If you are delivering the data to the user, they have it, and you must assume they have it forever. If this was a hobbyist’s “fun” project, it would be acceptable – OK sure, someone can screenshot images, or store them, but that’s fair enough. This isn’t a hobby app though, and it’s trying to do something unachievable. They want to implement DRM on a still image, when even the content producers haven’t managed to make effective DRM. Music labels gave up on it – the idea doesn’t work. Snapchat would be better putting their time into improving the application – they won’t stop people from screenshotting snapchats (without alerting the other person), if someone actually wants to – next thing, someone will just hook into the kernel and dump the framebuffer output. Good luck detecting or stopping that.\\n\\nThis inconvenience will result in many users dropping Snapchat and looking for some alternative, which will be more user-friendly, customizable and hopefully safe without applying these weird “patches”. If you, however, plan to stick with either Snapchat and root, you might have to give the Snapprefs a spin. MaarZ promised to deliver an update which will remove the root checks from the app. XDA will always find a way!\\n\\nIs Snapchat’s decision correct? Are you going to stop using this application?

       " \"President Donald Trump’s stops in Cedar Rapids Wednesday touched on many important Iowa issues, from wind power to wrestling. The Gazette’s Fact Checker will review six statements for accuracy.\\n\\nBeef exports\\n\\nFirst, in a statement about Trump from former Gov. Terry Branstad — now U.S. ambassador to China — who congratulated the president on trade relations with China.\\n\\n“We’ve been trying to get American beef in China for 13 years and you’ve already done it,” Branstad said during an earlier event at Kirkwood Community College.\\n\\nThe United States has been frozen out of China’s beef market since 2003 when a case of mad cow disease got international attention. China dropped that ban in September — two months before Trump was elected. Increased trade talks this spring have resulted in an announcement last month that beef exports will be allowed into China by mid-July, according to news outlets, including National Public Radio.\\n\\nTrump deserves credit for new developments in Chinese markets, but not for changes that happened before he was elected. Branstad’s claim is only half true.\\n\\nTrump successes\\n\\nTrump said he has passed 38 bills since he was inaugurated Jan. 20. GovTrack.us reports 40 laws have been enacted since Jan. 3. The president is correct in his claim.\\n\\nThe coal industry has gotten a boost from Trump, who issued an executive order in March rescinding parts of President Barack Obama’s clean power plan.\\n\\nTrump talked about those changes and touted “clean, beautiful coal,” telling the Cedar Rapids audience at the U.S. Cellular Center Wednesday that “30,000 mining jobs have been added since my inauguration.”\\n\\nThis claim has been checked by several news outlets, including CNN Money, which spoke with a former Trump economic adviser who said the number of new mining jobs actually was closer to 43,000. However, Labor Department statistics show half those jobs were in oil and gas — not coal — and another 6,000 were in “non-metallic mining and quarrying, digging for things like granite and marble,” CNN reported.\\n\\nOnly 1,300 of the new jobs were in coal mines, according to CNN.\\n\\nSo while Trump’s statement is technically true with regard to the mining sector overall, linking it directly to coal is misleading.\\n\\nHealth Care\\n\\nAs the U.S. Senate considers a new health care plan, Trump told the Cedar Rapids audience the Affordable Health Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is dying, by which he meant “insurance companies have all fled” Iowa.\\n\\nWhile some insurers have pulled out, Minnesota-based Medica announced Monday it will sell individual insurance plans for the 2018 coverage year. As the last provider standing, Medica said it will increase rates an average 43.5 percent for all products.\\n\\nTrump could have said most insurance companies have fled and be right. As it was, the claim is false.\\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\nWhen lauding Iowa farming, Trump brought up the Obama administration’s Clean Water Rule, also called Waters of the United States, which clarifies the 1972 Clean Water Act to protect streams and wetlands.\\n\\nRepublicans reviled the rule, saying it was overly broad and confusing.\\n\\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT NEWS AND SPORTS The day's top stories right in your inbox.

       " 'CRS warns about uselessness of FBI-employed food-purchase surveillance Nick Juliano\\n\\nPublished: Wednesday January 2, 2008\\n\\n\\n\\ndel.icio.us |\\n\\nPrint This Email This In separate report, UK-based privacy watchdog says US \\'endemic surveillance\\' is among world\\'s worst Congressional researchers warned last month that attempts to identify potential terrorists based on food purchases could easily be based on inaccurate information and waste government time and resources. It\\'s unclear if reports that the FBI had been doing precisely that led to the Congressional Research Service admonition. But a 41-page CRS report outlines several ways in which data mining falls short as a terror-preventing tactic. The data-mining mismanagement identified by CRS serves as one of myriad reasons a UK-based privacy watchdog has ranked the United States alongside China, Russia and Singapore among the top surveillance societies on the globe. In its report, CRS warned that the government was pushing forward with data-mining efforts ostensibly to prosecute the War on Terror, despite concerns about inaccurate and incomplete information that could \"make data mining an ill-suited tool\" for predicting terrorist activity. In the case of shopper\\'s club cards, data that grocery stores use to target coupons and advertisements at customers might be useless when applied to national security investigations because of recordkeeping errors, inaccurate information or duplicate records, CRS warns. If a government agency were to use that information to target individuals based on food purchases associated with particular religious observances though, an outcome based on inaccurate information could be, at the least, a waste of resources by the government agency, and an unpleasant experience for the misidentified individual. However, according to Jeff Stein in Congressional Quarterly, the FBI \"sifted through\" grocery store data around San Francisco in 2005 and 2006. \"The idea,\" Stein writes, \"was that a spike in, say, falafel sales, combined with other data, would lead to Iranian secret agents in the south San Francisco-San Jose area.\" The FBI, for its part, issued a vague non-denial denial pronouncing the story \"too ridiculous to be true.\" Effort wasted examining grocery store receipts was not the only problem identified by CRS in its survey of government data-mining efforts, including the \"Total Information Awareness\" program (which was later renamed the \"Terrorism Information Awareness\" program in an \"Orwellian\" twist to placate critics). Such routine access to privately collected data on Americans, not to mention the NSA\\'s warrantless wiretapping program and Congress\\'s attempts to scuttle oversight of possible abuses as it rewrites the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, has the US listed as an \"endemic surveillance society\" in Privacy International\\'s latest survey. As Kim Zetter notes at Wired\\'s Threat Level blog: In terms of statutory protections and privacy enforcement, the US is the worst ranking country in the democratic world. In terms of overall privacy protection the United States has performed very poorly, being out-ranked by both India and the Philippines and falling into the \"black\" category, denoting endemic surveillance.

The name is found elsewhere at Walt Disney World in the ultra upscale neighborhood of single family homes that are being built adjacent to Fort Wilderness Campground nearby.\\n\\nSeating for Golden Oak Outpost is all outside. There are several tables and stools grouped next to the tiny quick service spot.\\n\\nIf it’s pouring rain or way too hot to sit outside, head over and snag a table at nearby Pecos Bill or Tortuga Tavern.\\n\\nThe kiosk is also located very close to the entry/exit gates for Magic Kingdom parades. Keep this in mind and plan accordingly if you think you might be grabbing some lunch or dinner here.\\n\\nEats\\n\\nThe menu at Golden Oak Outpost tends to vary according to season and crowd level. Pickings were slim the day that I visited, and consisted of two chicken options — a sandwich and nuggets. To round out the menu, there are also fries and a few dessert options as well as beverages.\\n\\nCondiments, plastic ware, and napkins are neatly arranged off to the right. And for such a small menu, there’s a surprising number of options! A couple of sauces are great for dipping nuggets, or even for dressing your sandwich or adding flavor to fries.\\n\\nSalt, pepper, and mustard are also handy in case you’d like to spice things up a bit.\\n\\nThere are also mayonnaise and ketchup for dressing and dipping.\\n\\nCondiments for your coffee and plastic ware for eating round out the offerings.\\n\\nWhen it was time to order, I went with the Fried Chicken Breast Sandwich. The sandwich comes dressed with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and ranch dressing. It’s kind of like having a side salad on your sandwich!\\n\\nIt’s also served with your choice of fries or apple slices. I went for the fries.\\n\\nThe sandwich was a keeper! The bun was a little nondescript, but the chicken was nicely seasoned and breaded with a juicy texture and good flavor. I could have done without the salad, but actually the shredded lettuce and diced tomato was a nice change from slabs of veggies.\\n\\nThe Fries are those wonderful standard Disney fries — medium-cut and fried to a perfectly crispy golden brown, but still soft inside.\\n\\nMy food was fresh, delicious, and best of all — fast.\\n\\nOverall\\n\\nYou probably aren’t going to make a special trip to Golden Oak Outpost. After all, the options here are available at lots of places.\\n\\nBut it is nice to know that you have some tasty choices way back in this corner of the park if you don’t want to queue up at the closest counter service. And if you happen to be waiting for the rest of your party to finish a ride and hunger strikes, this is a great spot to grab some nuggets or a sandwich.\\n\\nHave you ever stopped by Golden Oak Outpost?

       " '“When I heard about them I was like, man, I want to see these guys,” said Desmond Mitchell, 40, a fish supervisor for the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe.\\n\\nLahontan cutthroats, Nevada’s state fish, evolved in the Great Basin, which was flooded under a giant inland sea called Lake Lahontan during the last ice age. Pyramid Lake, which today lies on a Paiute Indian reservation, was part of that ancient lake, and inside its unique inland water system, which includes the Truckee River and Lake Tahoe, a giant strain of trout evolved.\\n\\n“Our fish have deep meaning for us, spiritually,” said Albert John, executive director of fisheries for the tribe. “And if they could get to 40 pounds again, whoa, that’d be awesome.”\\n\\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fishermen netted scores of Lahontan cutthroats to feed miners and loggers gnawing at the Sierra Nevada Mountains. But the Truckee River, where the fish spawned, was dammed, and its level dropped as water was taken for irrigation. It was also polluted with chemicals and sawdust. And Lake Tahoe was stocked with a nonnative char called lake trout, which gobble baby cutthroat. By the mid-1940s, all the native trout in Pyramid Lake and Lake Tahoe were dead and the strain was declared extinct.\\n\\n“They never should have gone in the first place,” said Fred Crosby, 66, owner of Crosby Lodge, the only bar, restaurant, gas station and tackle shop in tiny Sutcliffe, Nev., a poor reservation town on the west shore of Pyramid Lake.',\n",
       " 'On the evening of Thursday April 3rd, students from the Toronto Revolutionary Students Movement (RSM) and several other progressive campus groups at University of Toronto (U of T) gathered at the corner of St. George and Harbord. They stood on the manicured lawn and shouted, “Down with misogyny! Down with U of T! Down with the bourgeoisie!”\\n\\nWhat were the students protesting? Once again, U of T had lent its halls to Men’s Rights Activists (MRAs), inviting them to do its fourth event on campus since September 2012. The prim bourgeois facade of the university provided a good cover for the ugly misogyny being hosted inside.\\n\\nThe vilest of the MRAs are associated with the website, A Voice for Men (as if men lacked a voice in our society!). The members of this website are best known for posting photographs of female students who protested their event back in November 2012, publishing their names and other personal information and going so far as to encourage people to “track down and harass” the students. Amusingly referring to themselves as non-violent and civil, they incite hatred against women who dare to speak up against them.\\n\\nThe men came together on a talk that examines how society has changed from being misogynistic to misandrist (yes- this is a serious concern of MRAs). Of the 40 or some people who attended the event, about 40+ came to protest. The group of protestors were modestly sized but effective and garnered a great deal of support from people passing through the area. Several students spoke, but it was the member of the RSM who revealed the true nature of men’s “oppression” – laying the blame squarely at the feet of capitalism.\\n\\nAt 7 pm, the students entered the building where the MRA were hosting their event. They banged on the doors behind which locked MRAs were too scared to come out. Campus pigs were called in to defend them. The students’ chanting thundered down the hallway of the building, “One struggle, one fight! Women, men & trans people unite!”\\n\\nBy 8 pm the MRAs had been flushed out by a fire alarm. The protesters and the MRAs converged outside the building. The students chanted and shouted through their megaphone and one MRA hit a student in anger. The student fought back. Several people scuffled and exchanged verbal assaults. The tension between those who wish to see liberation of all oppressed women and those who refer to women as “fuckmuffins” was understandably high.\\n\\nThe most interesting fact about the MRAs is how easily they have laid claim to the language of equality and anti-oppression. It is telling that this language is so effortlessly co-opted. According to the MRAs they are being silenced and oppressed, their voice drowned out by the evil feminists- they frame themselves as victims.\\n\\nThe RSM rejects the postmodern idea that every viewpoint is inherently valid and that reactionaries are entitled to free expression, we see how backwards politics can be easily masked by a veil of liberalism.\\n\\nSegments of the population that are suddenly experiencing a loss of privilege have been retreating to reactionary politics to look for answers. Revolutionary working-class consciousness is so low that any loss of privilege is perceived as an act of oppression.\\n\\nIf the MRAs were genuine they would be mobilizing with anti-poverty groups to struggle for shelter beds for the homeless, or protesting the racist prison-industrial complex that kills hundreds of marginalized men. The MRAs who gathered around the U of T campus would do well to fight to save the Transitional Year Program, where many proletarian men and women alike are given a second chance to receive a university education. This is assuming the MRAs are serious when they say they care about these issues and are not just using them as excuses to rage against feminism.\\n\\nThere are legitimate questions that must be addressed – why are men overwhelmingly the ones inside prisons? Why do men often work dangerous jobs while simultaneously suffering poor mental health? The answer to these questions can be traced to capitalism which upholds oppressive gender roles for its own profit. It is not feminism that has made men “disposable” – it is capitalism, where human beings become mere commodities. The MRAs refuse to acknowledge that even with these issues facing men, men are still the ones with power; even the most powerless man can feel superior to women in this misogynist society. Proletarian women are still the most economically marginalized, they are still harassed and assaulted on a daily basis and burdened with childcare, care of the elderly and domestic duties in addition to their undervalued and underpaid jobs.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe modern day reactionary phenomenon known as MRAs shows the agony of the animal who does not know where his pain comes from, but also the vicious claws of a rabid dog. Communists should definitely fight the MRAs, but they should reach the masses before MRA ideology and similar backwards ideas take a firm hold. Communists should also struggle with liberal feminists to assert the correct feminist position, one that traces the root of oppression to the class struggle.\\n\\nGender and race are but class in drag!\\n\\nAdvertisements',\n",

       " 'Is it possible that there are alien structures on the Moon? Or what if, the Moon itself is an Alien structure? For over 20 years, people have debated whether there is something anomalous with Earth’s natural satellite, now it seems that after all, the Moon is filled with surprises.\\n\\nAccording to reports from Ufologists and from several UFO websites, there is an Alien city on the surface of the Moon. Some have even gone as far as to suggest that a highly advanced civilization inhabits a certain region of the moon, and that the existence of these “Aliens” has been covered up by NASA and the United States government.\\n\\nHave Ufologists gone too far this time? Or is it possible that there are structures on the moon According to THIS Ufologist, we are looking at clear images of a lunar city located inside a lunar crater, and we can all check it out using Google Earth.\\n\\nScott C. Waring, editor of the popular blog UFO Sightings Daily firmly believes he has found clear evidence of the existence of “little green men” on the surface of the moon. He believes that the alien city has been constructed on purpose inside the lunar crater. Mr. Waring used Google Moon to locate the crater found in the “Lacus Veris” region.\\n\\nIf you want to check out the alleged alien lunar city or yourself, head on over to this link and get yourself a cop of the software millions of people are using to explore the moon for crashed UFO’s, structures and cities. Once installed, from the View/Explore menu select\\n\\n“Moon” and enter the following coordinates which will take you to the mysterious alien lunar city:18° 0’56.81″S 86° 7’35.50″W.\\n\\nFor those of you who don’t feel like installing Google Earth, here are the images of the alleged lunar city:\\n\\nMr. Waring circled the area in red where he believes the Alien city is located.\\n\\n“Looking over Google Moon map I found an alien hive structure inside of a crater. The crater is located just below Lacus Veris and looks far from the norm of what humans would expect an alien structure to look like,” Waring writes. “Near it there is a crater that shows a face, with a large hat or hair, and an eating, the face shows an object like a snake or tough coming from its mouth.”\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time UFO hunters have found strange things on the Moon. According to many people, Earth’s natural satellite is in fact a giant Alien base, which is one of the main reasons humans have not visited the moon lately.\\n\\nSo, what are your thoughts? Is it possible that UFOlogists have gone too far with this one? Or is it possible that the moon does in fact have mysterious structures that cannot be the result of natural formations?',\n",

This week, Tan has finally released the film’s title and some behind-the-scenes photos on Twitter.\\n\\nThe fact that the film’s name is The Fire Born is about all we know right now, save for the fact that Tan is very clearly the star of the film. Along the lines of #StarringJohnCho, but it’s good to see a film finally in the works that features an Asian man as the leading man. Also great is that both Alexander and Tan are not just aware of the issues facing minority talent in Hollywood, they are working on the frontlines to make things different for all actors and directors in Hollywood.\\n\\nOkay, I’ll quit writing now since, if you’re anything like the hoardes of men-loving folk who are watching Iron Fist only for Tan, you just want to see these pictures.

       " \"Learning something new every day just ain't enough, so we rounded up a herd of pros, experts, and autodidacts; interrogated them (gently); and laid down their secrets here. Dig in to our encyclopedic array of do-it-yourself intelligence and discover the right way to climb high, fool fish, brew beer, abandon ship, get frisky in midair, and much, much more.\\n\\n1. Fake a Sick Day\\n\\nBrilliant tactics from Paul Lieberstein, a.k.a. Toby Flenderson, the human resources dude on NBC’s The Office:\\n\\nFake two sick days (you got it BAD), in the middle of the week. If possible, schedule them so you miss a “fun” work event, like a special (free) lunch.\\n\\nRent some movies the first day; play outside the next. If caught, say you’re feeling better but are still contagious. Tell the person who catches you that you don’t want to touch or breathe on him.\\n\\nOnce you’re back at work, never imply that you took some “time off.” Instead, say, “Believe me, that was a hard time.” trust no one with the truth—absolutely no one.\\n\\nBe prepared for the fact that some will never believe you were sick, but it’s their job to pretend to believe you. And the sad/happy truth is, as long as no one has to do your work for you, no one really cares whether you’re there or not.\\n\\n2. Fix a Motorcycle (With Your Teeth)\\n\\nPop! That’s the sound of trouble on two wheels. If your clutch cable snaps, you can find yourself stranded a long way from home, in the wrong place at the wrong time. It happened to me eight years ago in Cambodia while riding a rented motorbike between Khmer Rouge and government positions after a day of negotiating for interviews with Maoist maniacs. I coasted to a stop. It was sunset, and I was ten miles from safety in a heavily mined no-man’s-land of poisonous snakes and AK- 47-toting farmers, with a bunch of murderers on my tail. You’re always told to pack a spare cable, and I did—inside my saddlebags, 6,000 miles away. In the real world, there are often no parts, few tools, and less time, so:\\n\\nUse a rock to smash open the cable’s metal tip. Strip back the plastic covering (your teeth will work). Find the broken wire and bite it. Pull. Knot the stub around a small pebble. Slot it all into the bottom of your clutch handle. Get outta Dodge.\\n\\n—Patrick Symmes\\n\\n3. Be Fearless in Whitewater\\n\\n“It’s hard to be fearless,” says pro kayaker Brad Ludden. “That’s half the reason you do it.” But to boost your confidence in big water, use these tips:\\n\\nIt’s OK to be nervous while scouting. But once you’re in the boat, total confidence is the only option. Look where you want to go. Cringing at those huge holes in your line can land you in them. Focus: Even Class V rapids have clear lines. Practice the hard moves in easy rapids. Ferrying, eddy hopping, and surfing are the basics of every skill level. “When you’ve got it,” says Ludden, “kayaking becomes a sort of meditation.”\\n\\n4. Brew a Seasonal Beer\\n\\nAh, the dog days! High beer-swilling season! Which means trips to the store, which mean getting out of the hammock, which is unfortunate—and just another great excuse to brew your own, which is why we asked BeerTown.org’s Ray Daniels, author of Designing Great Beers, to provide a delicious, foolproof summertime recipe.

Have a rough idea of what you need and buy essentials first. Then see what else is ripe.\\n\\nDon’t assume all crops are locally grown. Seek out regional sustainable farmers and you’ll probably get produce picked that morning.\\n\\nCheck for the presence of vibrant stems and leaves, sure indicators of freshness.\\n\\nNo one knows the produce better than the farmer, so ask for tips on storing and cooking. You might end up with a secret family recipe.\\n\\nTry one new, seasonal ingredient each week to spice things up. (Find local grub bazaars at ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets.)\\n\\n—Sarah Hubbard\\n\\n7. Drink Without a Corkscrew\\n\\nYou’re an idiot. In the middle of nowhere. With a bottle but no tool with which to liberate the vino languishing within. Fret not: You can get at that good stuff. You can even choose whether to bow to thirst or decorum: Don’t overthink it; just jam the cork into the bottle, gingerly decant, and plan to drink it all that night. Too gauche for you? Then ram the butt of the bottle against a tree (trust me) until the cork rises enough for you to take the tip of a blade and pry it out little by little—in a spiral- staircase pattern, so as not to break it. Or you can keep ramming until it sticks up far enough to yank it out. Now quaff like Falstaff.\\n\\n—Jeremy Spencer\\n\\n8. Get Picked for Pickup Hoops\\n\\nBasketball at the park may do just fine without refs, but that doesn’t mean there are no rules. While playing at 200 courts across the country, and sizing up many more, for his book Hoops Nation, Chris Ballard compiled some nearly universal guidelines for interlopers hoping to fit in: Look the part by wearing basketball shoes and shorts, but don’t announce that you’re a poseur by rolling up in an NBA jersey.\\n\\nFigure out who has next game—or, if there’s a line, who’s last—by asking who’s got next or last. If there’s no room for you on the squads in line, call your spot at the end. Use your waiting time to study the house rules: Going to 11 or 15? By ones or ones and twos? Win by two or straight up?\\n\\nStart strong. Lead with a crazy shot and you won’t touch the ball again.\\n\\nCall fouls loudly and immediately, but be selective: The fastest way to devalue your stock is a “soft” call.\\n\\nIf you’ve got an open shot within range, take it—after all, you’re here to play, right?\\n\\n—Tim Sohn\\n\\n9. Perfect Your Form\\n\\nYou’re in a dumpy motel with no gym. Fine. Just lounge in your underwear, watch bad TV, and work out. All you need is the floor to bust out some push-ups, crunches, and squats, right? Wrong. Without proper form, you’re wasting your time. So we got EXOS founder Mark Verstegen to tell you how to make the classics count.\\n\\nPush-Up : With hands at sides and thumbs parallel to mid-chest, keep back and shoulders aligned, push up until before elbows lock. Hold for a beat; lower until elbows are at 90 degrees, slightly tucked in. Keep chest up and head down.\\n\\n: With hands at sides and thumbs parallel to mid-chest, keep back and shoulders aligned, push up until before elbows lock. Hold for a beat; lower until elbows are at 90 degrees, slightly tucked in. Keep chest up and head down. Crunch : With heels on the floor, hands laced behind head, and chin slightly tucked, crunch sternum toward hips, rolling upward until shoulders are four to six inches off the floor. Hold for two beats before reversing in a steady, controlled movement.\\n\\n: With heels on the floor, hands laced behind head, and chin slightly tucked, crunch sternum toward hips, rolling upward until shoulders are four to six inches off the floor. Hold for two beats before reversing in a steady, controlled movement. Squat: With feet shoulder width apart, toes forward, hands on thighs, “unlock” hips and squat as you reach arms up and out. The movement should come from the hips, and thighs should be parallel to the ground or close. Maintain a neutral spine, without letting your pelvis tuck under. Keep your shoulders, knees, and toes aligned. Keep chest up, shoulders down and back, and feet flat. (For all of these, remember to exhale through exertion.)\\n\\n—Megan Gambino\\n\\n10. Escape an Attacking ...\\n\\nBaboon\\n\\nNotoriously fast and wily, baboons sometimes assault people, have snatched crying babies, and can open car doors.\\n\\nTrouble: If you’re standing between a female and her baby, watch out—the troop will gang-attack. Neither stare nor yawn; both mean “I want to fight” in Monkey. Stay out of the way, and never, ever feed one.\\n\\nTactics: Stand, shout, and clap. Still coming? You’re holding food. Drop the Twinkie. Slowly back away. Never let them see your bum.\\n\\nMoose\\n\\nThe bull, one of the largest mammals in the U.S., can top out at 1,600 pounds, stand six feet tall, and sport 50 pounds of antlers and six-inch hooves. This ornery ungulate has been known to kill; winter, with its tiresome snows, and autumn, when bulls are drunk on testosterone, are the most dangerous times.\\n\\nTrouble: If its ears lie back, the hair on the hump of its neck stands up, or it clenches its teeth, it doesn’t like you.\\n\\nTactics: Run or get behind something big. Take off and most charges will end as bluffs. If not, says moose biologist Terry Bowyer, “you could be playing ring around the tree for 20 minutes.”\\n\\nElephant\\n\\nThe world’s largest vegetarians are responsible for an estimated 500 deaths a year. Get one riled up and as much as six tons could be steamrolling your way at 25 to 30 miles an hour.\\n\\nTrouble: You smell eau de rotting flowers, urea, and Obsession. It’s a bull in musk. Angry elephants kick up dirt, swing their trunks, trumpet, and hold their floppy ears straight out.\\n\\nTactics: Get behind something really big. Nothing around? Run. Heading down a steep hill will slow Jumbo down.\\n\\n—Joe Spring\\n\\n11. Land a Lunker at Flat Creek\\n\\nJackson, Wyoming’s Flat Creek is to fly-fishing what Pipeline is to surfing, so you’re bound to get skunked your first time out. “It’s part of the challenge with any spring creek,” says 15-year Flat Creek veteran Ned Hutchinson, a product manager for Cloudveil fly-fishing gear. Here’s how he gets his clients beyond “the one that got away” and into that magical place where Zen, an unhealthy attachment to Izaak Walton’s The Compleat Angler, and a fluttering heart collide: When you approach the water to scout, stay away from the edge. Better yet, belly-crawl. Cutthroat congregate under the cutbanks and will spook at almost any disturbance.\\n\\nOnce you spot a worthy fish—18 inches or larger—watch it for a few minutes to time its rise pattern. Count the seconds between rises. Often, cut-throat stay down for a few minutes and then come up to eat three or four consecutive times. That’s when you strike.\\n\\nWhen it’s time to cast your flies—gray drakes, mahogany duns, PMDs, and sneaky terrestrials—presentation is all-important. Use a 12-to-15-foot leader and pick a spot where you can make a drag-free drift.\\n\\nStack line slack in S-curves so a dragless fly is the first thing the fish sees. And try not to let the shadow of your casting line cross the fish. “Lining” a cutthroat is a sure way to scare it off. Now: Wait for it ...\\n\\n12. Hire the Right Trekking Guide\\n\\nEric Simonson, co-founder of International Mountain Guides, has led trips and hired help in Africa, South America, and throughout the Himalayas. Simonson says: look around. Google, post queries on forums (thorntree.lonelyplanet.com, boards.bootsnall.com), and call reputable hotels.\\n\\nYou want a guide with great communication; talk to candidates about how often they’ve done your itinerary, what to expect on the trail, and what they pay staff.\\n\\nNegotiate all costs up front, especially in Africa—park fees, in-country flights, tips, etc., can be hidden in the fine print.\\n\\nTrust your gut—if a guide doesn’t have his act together or won’t answer questions, move on.\\n\\nHelp protect porters by following the guidelines at portersprogress.org.\\n\\n—Jason Daley\\n\\n13. Shag on a Portaledge\\n\\nSo you’ve just climbed a 5.12 with a 10.0 and you’re all sweaty and hot and ... OK, sometimes there’s no avoiding getting it on in that tiny bit of elevated shelter. According to one anonymous (and persuasive) climber and pro photographer (no, not Jimmy Chin), sex on a portaledge is a beautiful thing, dammit. “All models are going to be strong enough,” says ... well, let’s just call him Rico, and Rico thinks Black Diamond’s roomy Cliff Cabana double portaledge ($700; bdel.com) scores highest for ethereal amore. But “when you let down the shark fin or middle dividers, you slide into a pit and can’t move much.” As with sex in a hammock, rolling around isn’t an option. Instead, choose one position (harnesses allowed) and commit; otherwise the ’ledge might get a bit tipsy. “Baby wipes also make things nicer,” he’s proud to share. TMI, Rico. TMI.\\n\\n—J.D\\n\\n14. Survive an All-Night Race\\n\\nGolden, Colorado–based pro mountain biker Nat Ross has competed solo in at least three dozen twice-around-the-clock events—todays’ preeminent endurance sufferfests—most recently winning Utah’s 24 Hours of Moab in 2006. Here are his tried and true methods for making those long, hard rides as painless as possible: check ride424.com, pick your race, and give yourself six weeks to prepare. Get your bike properly fitted to your body (see wobblenaught.com), then work in some four-to-six-hour sessions and night rides, and train after meals to get used to going hard after eating.\\n\\nStart out at a comfortable pace—it takes a few laps to get your nerves unjangled—then settle into a groove and stay hydrated.\\n\\nMunch on the go: fruit, burritos, mashed potatoes, ravioli.\\n\\nRotate water and sports drinks, using different hydration packs for each, and go for 50 to 70 ounces per lap.\\n\\nPrevent blisters: Switch gloves and socks, use chamois cream on your nether regions, and align and tighten your cleats.\\n\\nLayer for a balance of warmth and wicking.\\n\\nOh, yeah: Have fun.\\n\\n—Megan Michelson\\n\\n15. Master the Flick\\n\\nYour classic backhand throw is great for less intense sessions that may or may not involve doobie and bare feet. But in the hard-charging realm of ultimate Frisbee, the full-field forehand, or flick, is king. Josh “Zip” Ziperstein has won college ultimate’s version of the Heisman, a national championship while at Brown University, and a gold medal at the World Games, so we asked him how he gets 175 grams of plastic to make like a thunderbolt flung off Mount Olympus.\\n\\nGrip : Place pointer and middle fingers on inside rim of disc, ring and pinkie along outside rim.

Leave a Motel Room\\n\\nBy Ian Frazier\\n\\nThe act touches on mortality. It offers a small dose of the autobiographical sadness you feel after the moving van has gone and you take a last look around the place where you used to live. Travelers who must face this experience on a daily basis should brace for it with stoutness of heart and the comfort of ritual.\\n\\nFirst, shower. Then put on all the clothes you expect to wear that day. (Your coat may be left until right before departure.) Fill your pockets with everything you normally carry, except for the room key. Place that in a prominent spot on top of a few singles or a five, for the cleaning people or the demons of the room.\\n\\nPack your briefcase. Pack all other gear, and then your clothes. Take the suitcase out to the car first, leaving the room door ajar. (I flick the little metal-bar thing across the frame to keep it open.) Come back for your other gear. Leave your briefcase with the most important stuff last.\\n\\nThe slamming of car doors in the morning is the unwelcome rooster crow of the motel world, so I make it a point of honor to avoid slamming anything. Ideally, in good weather, I like to load up and leave without closing any car door more than twice. When the car is loaded, it’s time for a final look around the room. Check the closet—and always remember the little hook behind the bathroom door. (I’ve left a lot of pajamas on those hooks.) For the very last, I always get down and look under the bed. I have never once found any forgotten object there, but I always check just the same. On family trips when I was little, my father always used to do that last of all. He has been dead now for 20 years; I like to imprint on my mind the same under-motel-room-bed vista that he saw. At this moment of transience, it gives me a reassuring sense of eternity.\\n\\n—Ian Frazier collects wrappers from motel soaps. His favorite is called First Date\\n\\n17. Stroll Away from a Fall\\n\\nRiding the ragged edge of your skill level is key if you want to break through in any sport, so brutal endoes, yard sales, and whippers are de rigueur. Soften those blows with a little preemptive TLC from the experts: Most mountain-biking falls occur at slow speeds, says former world champion (and eternal badass) Ned Overend, and appropriate pedal tension will help you unclip before stalling out. Going ass over teakettle? “Put your hands out,” he says. “As soon as they touch ground, recoil your arms, tuck to one side—whichever is more comfortable—and roll across your back to avoid any jolting impact to your outstretched arms or shoulders.”\\n\\nA hyperex-tended thumb is a nasty skiing injury, but a torn medial collateral ligament (MCL) is a real nightmare, says Dr. Kevin Plancher, an official surgeon for the U.S. ski and snowboard teams. Prevent these common boo-boos by closing your fists and sitting into a fall, which can save your knees from hyperextension.\\n\\nTo weather a roped-lead fall while climbing, keep your arms free and make sure you don’t get inverted by tangling the rope around your legs, advises Don Mellor, author of 2001’s American Rock. Use your hands to protect yourself from outcrops, but be wary of pushing off the face of a cliff; the more you push, the more, and harder, you’ll swing back.\\n\\n—M.G.\\n\\n18. Run Like the Wind\\n\\nOr the breeze, whatever. The three keys, according to Chris Carmichael, are a smooth stride, explosive power, and a strong torso. Here’s how to get them:\\n\\nStrides, not all-out sprints, mean running as fast as you can while focused on form: back straight, head up, arms pumping in a straight line. Work them into normal runs, four reps of 20 seconds, resting 60 seconds between intervals. Best off pavement.\\n\\nSkipping improves fast-twitch muscle fibers and anaerobic power. Work in two sets of three 30-second reps; jog a minute between reps, three minutes between sets.\\n\\nPlanks create core strength, which generates a quicker, more efficient stride—otherwise you’re just flailing. Start in a modified push-up, on your forearms. With legs, torso, and head in a straight line, hold for 30 seconds. Three mornings a week, four reps, resting 30 seconds between. Work up to holding the pose for a minute.\\n\\n19. Create a B&W Digital Photo\\n\\nMake a nice black-and-white by shooting digitally in color and converting using Adobe Photoshop, advises mountaineer and photographer Jimmy Chin: “Most people make the mistake of discarding the color information or desaturating the picture,” he says. “Instead, use the channel mixer to fine-tune tone and contrast.”\\n\\nFrom the “image” menu, select “adjust,” then “channel mixer,” and check the monochrome box to grayscale it. Determine the dominant colors—red, green, or blue—in your shot.\\n\\nAdd red to give skin tones more contrast, blue to brighten snow and ice. If the combination of numerical color values adds up to more than 100 percent, balance luminosity using the “constant” slider.\\n\\nFinally, be subtle. Unless they’re Civil War reenactors, no one wants to look like they’re in a daguerreotype.\\n\\n20. Drive on Sand\\n\\nWhen the sweetest surfing or fishing spots are way the hell down a long (vehicles-allowed) beach, do like ranger Wouter Ketel, of North Carolina’s Cape Lookout National Seashore (and don’t, like, forget to check the tides): Take a 4x4 with good clearance.\\n\\nMud and snow tires dig into sand; radials float. Drop them to 18 or 20 psi for better traction.\\n\\nWhen you hit a soft section, don’t stop; use your momentum or a slow acceleration to get through. And try not to make quick turns.\\n\\nIf you start to sink, don’t spin your wheels—you’ll go deeper. Dig the sand away, lower pressure a bit more, and jam a board under a tire for grip—but keep in mind the possibility of said board hurtling toward yon innocent bystanders.\\n\\n—Mark Anders\\n\\n21. Cook a Perfect Meal\\n\\nAppetizers\\n\\nChilled dungeness crab with homemade cocktail sauce; deviled eggs; prosciutto-wrapped grilled figs\\n\\nEntrée\\n\\nCedar-planked wild salmon; salad of whole-grain pasta and grilled vegetables; spicy greens with fresh cherries, goat cheese, and cherry balsamic vinaigrette\\n\\nDessert\\n\\nSummer-berry-and-olive-oil polenta cake; grilled peaches\\n\\nBesides the fact that you’re drooling, what's so perfect about this menu? It’s a balanced recovery feast* that follows the 40-30-30 ratio of carbs to fat to protein prescribed by nutri- tionists—and is damn delicious, too. “Chefs are concerned most about taste,” says Vitaly Paley, owner of Portland, Oregon’s award-winning Paley’s Place. “This meal is varied enough in flavor to keep the palate always wanting more.”\\n\\nTo hit that recovery-ratio sweet spot, Paley teamed with USA Cycling coach and flavor-savvy nutrition nut Michael Manning. “The protein sources are all high-quality,” says Manning. “The majority of the fat comes from olive oil, rich in monounsaturates. This reduces cholesterol for a healthy cardio-respiratory system. The salmon is a primary source of essential fatty acids, which improve metabolism and work to reduce inflammation. The majority of the carbs are from fresh fruits and vegetables and provide superior nourishment with antioxidants and other phytonutrients, in addition to supplying fiber.”\\n\\nSalivation is at hand.\\n\\n—Gordy Megroz\\n\\n*2,032 calories; replaces the energy burned by a 155-pound male on a 2.5-hour bike ride at an average of 17 mph.\\n\\n22. Survive a Bar Fight\\n\\nAnyone who’s been in a real rumble will tell you it’s a far more brutal affair than your choreographed fantasies of kicking ass like Patrick Swayze in Road House. “A fight is a no-win proposition,” says Peyton Quinn, 57, self-defense instructor, former bouncer, and author of A Bouncer’s Guide to Barroom Brawling. “You either go to jail, the emergency room, the courtroom, or all three.” Thus Quinn’s first rule: Avoid potentially violent encounters. Failing that ... Insults are intended to intimidate and elicit reaction. “You’re being interviewed as a potential victim,” says Quinn. don’t ignore, insult, or challenge an aggressor.\\n\\nSimply remain calm, look the guy in the eye, and respond assertively, giving him an honorable exit. Apologize if you were asking for it.\\n\\nIf he’s bent on an attack, hold your hands open at eye level, palms toward him, and yell, “Stay back! I don’t want to fight you.” You’ll draw attention and set up your legal defense.\\n\\n“If it does come to blows, you have to go off 110 percent,” says Quinn. The aggressor will likely throw a right hook first. As you deflect it, counter with an open palm or forearm (not a closed, breakable fist) to the bridge of the nose, a knee to the groin, a head butt to the chin.\\n\\nKeep it up, be sure to breathe, break his balance, and shove him as hard as you can while screaming that you don’t want to fight.\\n\\nThen you just haul ass.\\n\\n—T.S.\\n\\n23. Abandon Ship\\n\\nBy David Vann\\n\\nAs the boat sags back on its haunches like an old horse, don’t go below. It’s your honeymoon, sure, and everything you own in this world is aboard, but you can buy new wedding bands, replacements for the wedding gifts. If you escape with your life jacket and a pair of shorts, you’re doing well.\\n\\nDon’t follow the advice of your rescuers. They’ve told you, by radio, to put up your 90-foot main-sail, which will drive you through the water and sink you faster.\\n\\nDon’t panic. A freak storm and a rogue wave 60 to 100 feet cracked your hull, but you’ve struggled a day and a half to defer your sinking, so now you’re going down in fine conditions, sunny, waves no more than six feet. You’ve earned this.\\n\\nDon’t try last-minute heroics. Your rudder and a piece of the hull are 5,000 feet down, at the bottom of the sea. You could pull the storm jib under the boat as a patch, but the deck is rolling, your wife is starting to panic, and you might lack the sheer strength. And you’re sinking. Keep that idea forefront.\\n\\nDon’t go overboard without the dinghy. You’re cutting the lines that hold it, leaning far out over the stern, then you lose your footing and your feet are kicking midair. Your wife is not happy about this, and you shouldn’t be, either.\\n\\nDon’t go over the port side. Bit of confusion here. You gave the wrong orders, so now you’re at the stern with the dinghy and your wife is 30 feet away at the port rail. The boat is sinking to port and could roll over on her at any second. She’d be trapped by the pilothouse, masts, wires. You have a moment of feeling sure you’ve lost her, and you realize again (you had another moment like this off Casablanca after abandoning ship, when she fell into the water between the life raft and a 300-foot freighter) that you love her more than anything else in this world.\\n\\nDon’t think you’re safe once you’ve abandoned ship. That whole sucking-whirlpool thing could be fiction, but better to paddle away. Then, when a wave flips your dinghy and you go overboard and can feel your knee is badly damaged somehow, best to open your eyes underwater and grab that dinghy line as it goes by. In the water really is not where you want to be.\\n\\n—In October 2001, David Vann lost a quick million when his 90-foot ketch, Bird of Paradise, sank ten miles south of the British Virgin Islands.\\n\\n24. Tie Your Gear Down\\n\\nClimbers, Boy Scouts, and sailors may disagree, but the trucker’s hitch—highly adjustable and capable of piano-string tightness—is the handiest knot on the planet.\\n\\nSecure one end of a rope to your first tie-down point. Then make a quick-release loop between it and your second tie-down point. To do this, grab a section of the rope in your hand and twist it clockwise three times, then pull a section of slack line through it until you have a taut loop. Thread the loose end of the rope through the second tie-down point, then back through the loop you just made, and pull to tighten. Once you’ve got the line as tight as you like, clamp down on the loop with your thumb and forefinger, then finish the knot by wrapping a section of loose line around the taut line and pulling it through. To undo, simply tug on the loose tail of line to unravel the whole package. (Or, to really lock off the end, wrap the new loose loop you created around the taut line and pull it through.)\\n\\n—M.A.\\n\\n25. Dodge Montezuma’s Revenge\\n\\nChef Andrew Zimmern, host of the Travel Channel’s Bizarre Foods, has put more potential contaminants in his mouth than a Manhattan raccoon: live lemon ants in Ecuador’s Napo River basin, seal stew in the Yup’ik villages of Alaska, fresh mangrove worms in Palawan . . . And yet he’s never gotten the trots while on the road. What sorcery is this? Zimmern explains: “Use the New York City hot dog theory of eating: Buy your food from the folks with the longest lines, highest turnover, and best reputations. Let your instincts guide you: Hot foods should be hot, cold foods should be cold, and anything that smells bad should be questioned. Be sure your purveyor/shop-keeper/waiter can tell you where the item is from. And remember: If it looks good, eat it!” (And, duh, drink bottled water.)\\n\\n—J.D.\\n\\n26. Acclimatize Like a Pro\\n\\nAs you gain altitude, your red blood cells can’t hold as much oxygen, which means once you start get- ting into the thousands of feet above sea level, you may get easily winded, have a headache, and feel nauseated. Go really high—like, say, 20,000 feet and up—and your head might feel like it’s going to implode, you might puke, your lungs might fill with fluid, and you might die. Eight-time Everest summiter Dave Hahn and expedition doctor Deirdre Galbraith share some pointers on going up the right way.\\n\\nTake your time : Nothing is proven by initial displays of physical prowess; walk at a pace that allows conversation and comfortable breathing. Your sleeping altitude shouldn’t increase by more than about 1,000 feet a day; plan on active rest (like light exercise around camp) every third day.\\n\\n: Nothing is proven by initial displays of physical prowess; walk at a pace that allows conversation and comfortable breathing.

Reach Out Anywhere\\n\\nSometimes it takes more than a cell signal: Climbing in Europe and you want to keep up with that lass who offered to show you around Prague? You need a phone with GSM (Global System for Mobile), like Motorola’s new Motorizr Z3 ($250; $99 with rebates; motorola.com). You also need Telestial’s Explorer SIM Card ($59; telestial.com), with free incoming calls in 43 countries, plus just 55¢ per minute for outgoing calls.\\n\\nDoing business in China but need to be in e-mail and phone contact with offices in New York and Milan?

Ride in a Peloton\\n\\nFormer elite road and velodrome cyclist—and now coach for hire—David Brinton has taught thousands of newbies and pros how to pedal in a pack. So before you roll with a club, master his list of essential skills with a couple of experienced (and forgiving) riding buddies: Keep your front wheel six inches to a foot behind the rear wheel of the rider ahead of you. Focus on his hips.\\n\\nEtiquette for passing and other movement varies from group to group, but one rule is king: Surprises are bad, so be predictable.\\n\\nOnly the lead rider can see potential dangers, so safety depends on communication, with riders calling or pointing out obstacles. Stay alert and quickly pass warnings down the line.\\n\\nDownshift before red lights or you’ll get dusted when it turns green.\\n\\nDon’t slam on the brakes, look down, space out, or overlap your front wheel with rear wheels. Ever.\\n\\nSpit in the Pack\\n\\nAs peloton protocol goes, clocking the guy behind you with a loogie ties with sulfuric flatulence for the ultimate no-no. Avoid this gaffe by spitting like a pro:\\n\\nLean forward slightly and bow your head to one side. Extend your arm toward the ground, palm forward. Spit in front of your arm, which will block any spray.\\n\\n—Andrew Vontz\\n\\n29. Be a Dancing King\\n\\nSamba in Brazil, waltz in Austria, Bollywood in India, tango in Argentina, swing in the U.S., polka in Germany, reggae in Jamaica, hip-hop in Kenya, mambo in Cuba ... The world is your dance floor; be not afraid. Stepping on toes in five continents over the past decade, your dedicated correspondent (and Out of Bounds columnist)\\n\\nEric Hansen has formulated a few principles that will allow you to fake it or flaunt it. Anywhere. Let them be your passport to cavort: Your goal is—always and only—to make her look good. Usually, that means not embarrassing yourself while you let her do her thing: stomp, shimmy, spin like she’s in a hair-product commercial.\\n\\nIf you’re dancing in a country that writes its name in roman letters, you can usually default to a four-step side-to-side. Elsewhere—remote Nepal, for example—mimic the men.\\n\\nClubbing? Always keep your hands above your elbows. But don’t make fists; relax and pretend like you’re holding an egg in each hand.\\n\\nIn all partner dances besides swing, the dip should be employed with restraint and class; at the beginning, it’s dramatic; the middle, surprising; the end, glamorous.\\n\\nMake your partners look hot and they should increase in hotness.\\n\\n30. Prepare a Wild-Caught Rabbit for a Meal\\n\\nBy Jack Handey\\n\\nThe first thing you want to do, after catching a wild rabbit, is to calm the rabbit down. A panicked rabbit does not make for a pleasurable dining experience. It taints it. Pet the rabbit. Maybe say something soothing, like “Easy, Brownie, easy” (if the rabbit is brown) or “Easy, Gray Boy, easy” (if the rabbit is gray). You might just say, “Easy, little bunny.” (But, really, can’t you come up with some kind of name besides “bunny”?)\\n\\nFeel the belly. It should be plump and fuzzy. But skinny is fine, too. Feel the ears. They should be soft and pink. Man, I love the ears.\\n\\nIf you like your rabbit spicy, try rubbing him with wild sage or wild mint.\\n\\nPlace the rabbit on a rock with good drainage. Next, take out a long, sharp butcher knife. Try not to let the rabbit see the knife. You may not want to look at the knife yourself, as some of them are kind of scary-looking.\\n\\nHold the rabbit down firmly with one hand. With the other hand, take a carrot out of your backpack. Still holding the rabbit, place the carrot on the rock and slice it with the butcher knife. Then feed the carrot pieces to the rabbit. If the rabbit doesn’t eat all the pieces, feel free to eat the leftovers.\\n\\nLet the rabbit go. For fun, throw the knife at a tree trunk, to see if you can make it stick, like Jim Bowie or something.\\n\\n(P.S. The reason you want a rock with good drainage is in case he pees.)\\n\\n—Telling people how to do things is what Jack Handey loves best.\\n\\n31. Compete in Costume\\n\\nBecause nothing takes the edge off like making a fool of yourself. The trick is an outfit that lets you finish with a time you can live with. Crested Butte, Colorado, mayor Alan Bernoltz has entered ski races as a sumo wrestler, a trash can, and (his personal fave, pictured) Evel Knievel, among other things, for going on 20 years. His advice: How much are you willing to suffer? If the answer’s “not much,” just wear a cape or a funny hat.\\n\\nAvoid face paint. It will sweat off and blind you.\\n\\nWill the wind shift your balance? ditch the wings.\\n\\nCotton doesn’t keep you warm in storms. Incorporate performance fabrics.\\n\\nMake sure you have full range of motion. And visibility.\\n\\nTest everything before the race.\\n\\nWhen you’re dressed like a cartoon character, it just makes the people you pass go that much harder.

Buy a Wetsuit\\n\\nThe trick is a Speedo and two plastic grocery bags. Seriously. The Speedo is for hygiene: Think of the many (hairy, promiscuous) surfers and divers who may have tried that wetsuit on before you. Boxers and boardshorts will just bunch up and throw off the fit.\\n\\nPull the bags over your feet to slip into suits easily, and try several different brands; each has a unique shape. Also, peeling yourself out of a wetsuit is sweaty work, so don’t plan to try on more than three per outing.\\n\\nThe fit needs to be very snug, since your suit will stretch out in water. Make sure neoprene isn’t piling up around your elbows or knees. The neck should be comfortable, and watch for tightness in the underarms. Swing your arms around to simulate paddling. Feel rubbing? Don’t buy.\\n\\nOnce you’ve made your choice, lose the speedo.\\n\\n—M.A.\\n\\n33. Ski the Beach\\n\\nI live on an island off North Carolina, and I’m the freak of my neighborhood. I’m the guy who skis the beach. It started one day when I was jogging along the shore, knees and back aching. Since moving from New England, I’d missed snow and mountains, and as I stared at the flat sandbar I found myself longing for cross-country skiing, with its velvety rhythm. I looked at the sand again and thought, Why not? Step one is getting over any embarrassment. (Hey, Bill Koch, winner of Olympic cross-country silver in 1976, skied beaches in Hawaii.)\\n\\nClassic wax skis work best, but don’t overspend; sand and shells are harsh.\\n\\nChoose your beach wisely.

Pull Off a Mustache\\n\\nPhil Olsen, founder of Beard Team USA, which competes in the biennial World Beard and Moustache Championships, says: “Don’t shave at all for a few weeks. Allow the mustache to freely extend beyond the corners of your mouth. There will be a point when the hairs get in the way of food or drink—you’ll have to deal with that.”\\n\\nAs it gets longer, Olsen says, choose a style and start experimenting with gels, waxes, and unscented hairspray. What works best depends on your facial structure; small facial features warrant smaller mustaches, a big nose can handle a real push broom, square faces should sport squared-off cuts, and round faces need to go round.\\n\\nThe most important ingredient in a ’stache is attitude: Be proud of your mouth mane! “The majority of women don’t like it,” admits Olsen. “But the minority who do ... well, they really do.”\\n\\n—J.D.\\n\\nShave Like a Gent\\n\\nScraping your face with some ten-dollar, six-blade landfill fodder and calling it shaving is like squirting ketchup into hot water and calling it tomato soup.

But the majority of shifting issues (jumping chains, rough shifts, clacking) can be fixed fast with zero tools. So next time your shifting goes, follow these steps from cycling guru Lennard Zinn, a former U.S. National Team rider and the author of several books on bicycle maintenance:\\n\\nDetermine whether you need to tighten or loosen the cable. Shift up until the chain is on the smallest cog in the rear, then downshift one gear. If the chain doesn’t climb to the next cog, or if it does so slowly, you need to increase tension. If it over-shifts, you need to reduce it.* Find the barrel adjuster. It’ll be at the rear derailleur (most likely) or by the handlebars. To increase tension, turn the barrel adjuster counterclockwise (when viewed from the end where the cable housing enters the adjuster). To reduce tension, turn clockwise. The barrel adjuster will click as you turn it. Go one or two clicks and recheck the shifting. Repeat until the chain moves easily in both directions.\\n\\n*This holds true for most derailleurs. But some, called “low normal,” work in the opposite direction, with cable tension moving the chain away from the wheel, instead of toward it. To determine which kind you have, pull on the cable and watch which way the derailleur moves. If you have an LN, start on the largest cog and reverse this whole process.\\n\\n36.

If her head weren’t buried in your special purpose, you’d see a little woozy smile dawning on her face. Head for the bathroom. Take out your trusty Revlon needlenose tweezers.

       " \"Doom is excellent. Im not gonna lie here, my initial expectations were low, I expected a slow pace modern wannabe shooter consistent with the quality of games ID put up recently. I was blown away, I am a massive fan of the series and saw that this doom was everything I wanted. It is fast-paced, gore filled fun that only doom can deliver. My original guess was that it was going to pander to console players by making it slower ( I thought this after I saw the scroll wheel that slowed down game play.) It has been a long while since I have seen a shooter with intelligent map design, design which rewards players for playing the game at a faster pace, in fact I rarely found myself stopping in between combat, if at all. There is secrets galore in this game to. Not only that but the game itself is absolutely beautiful. From the large bosses to the small imps for pistol fodder every part of the game does not lack in design, This game reinvigorated my faith in ID. The online has obviously improved since the beta (Its great, i didn't get the chance to play the beta but I heard complaints) With a larger selections of weapons. In fact I see so many modding possibilities for the multiplayer on PC. After playing leagues and leagues of modern shooters this is the most refreshing multiplayer I have played in a while and will suck in hours and hours of my time I haven't really played around with snap map yet, but Ill be looking forward to it!. Anyway this reinvigorated the franchise and will forever be known as a classic, Amazing job id, i look forward for more\\n\\nRead more\",\n",

       " 'Lance Stephenson is coming off what many would refer to as a career year with the Indiana Pacers. Sadly, that isn’t saying much as it was the first time in three seasons that Stephenson received legitimate playing time. He had a great season, but 2013-14 is going to be even better.\\n\\nStephenson averaged 8.8 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists in 29.2 minutes per game last year. Measly numbers when you really think about it, however, it’s feasible to think he could surpass those numbers, minus the minutes played, this season even while coming off the bench.\\n\\nHe earned a spot in the starting rotation last season when Danny Granger went down with a knee injury during the preseason. He went on to accumulate 2,278 minutes on the court, nearly five times the amount of minutes he played his first two seasons in the league. That number will dwindle a tad, but he will still close in on 2,000 minutes. Every minute will be beneficial to Stephenson as he will need to continue to grow more comfortable on the court.\\n\\nBut Stephenson isn’t without his flaws. One area he really needs to work on is his shooting. He shot 46 percent last season, which isn’t terrible, but only 33 percent from three-point range, a shot he chose more often than not. An asset Stephenson failed to take advantage of last season was his speed. While he would use his speed during a fast break, once it broke down he would more often than not settle for a three-pointer instead of trying to take his man one-on-one. He will need to work on this if he expects to become a starter again in the NBA.\\n\\nIt was easy to give him a pass last season when he jacked up unnecessary shots or made boneheaded plays, but that all changes this year. A lot more will be expected from Stephenson, especially if he is the leader of the second unit. He can’t play haphazardly anymore. While he ranked only fifth on the Pacers in turnovers per game with 1.4, he also had just 10 more assists than David West. Don’t get me wrong, West is an amazing passer for a power forward, but Stephenson’s style of play leaves him open to throwing too many erratic passes.\\n\\nFor the Pacers to continue to succeed, Stephenson will need to play like a starter, not a bench player. The worst case scenario would be Stephenson coming down with “Hansbrough Syndrome” and not being able to handle playing off the bench after getting a significant amount of starts. From all accounts it doesn’t appear Stephenson will mind coming off the bench, but that’s easier said than done.\\n\\nStephenson is also in a contract year, which means he is playing for not only his next contract, but possibly a new suitor. Teams will be gunning to break up the Pacers if they continue to excel, and an easy target will be Stephenson. This is also a good thing for the Pacers because Lance knows he will have to perform better than last year if he wants a big payday, which means they will benefit this year from his improvements.\\n\\nLance Stephenson brings a different style of play to this Pacers team, one that is fun and exciting to watch, but he can also scare you at times. He will be able to work on reigning in his game this season, all while trying to win a championship and proving he belongs in any team’s starting lineup.\\n\\nMathew Muncy is an Indiana Pacers writer for RantSports.com.

According to the study, this reversed chemical and behavioural effects of the THC and eliminated schizophrenia-like symptoms.\\n\\n“We were able to pharmacologically restore the GABA system in the prefrontal cortex and remarkably what we saw was that it actually reversed all these behaviour deficits associated with this THC exposure,” said Laviolette.\\n\\nMore research is still needed to determine if boosting GABA has the same result in humans, but for those who have mental health problems Laviolette says there’s new hope.\\n\\n“I think this is a really promising lead in terms of the potential of developing much safer versions of cannabinoid type drugs,” he said.\\n\\nLaviolette added that these findings are especially important given the impending legalization of marijuana in Canada.\\n\\n“What this could mean is that if you are going to be using marijuana, in a recreational or medicinal way, you can potentially combine it with compounds that boost GABA to block the negative effects of THC,” he said in a statement.\\n\\nLaviolette and his team are now looking towards finding more effective and safer treatments for mental health disorders, such as addiction, depression and anxiety.\\n\\nWith files from CTV London’s Celine Moreau',\n",
       " 'Silhouette: The Story Silhouette is the product of internal Nintendo research over several years. In my opinion, the history of Silhouette is nothing short of fascinating, so please read this document at least once before you throw it in the trash. Originally developed under the code-name \"Mirage\" and designed to serve as a Super Famicom development environment, Silhouette has been modified into a working Super Nintendo emulation environment which rivals the best efforts of any public development. Adequate explanation of Silhouette requires a step back to the original days of Super Famicom development. The first batch of games for the Super Famicom were developed around 1988 and 1989. Popular Super Famicom titles, like F-Zero and Super Mario World, were the most difficult for several reasons--if nothing else, the Super Famicom hardware specifications changed in small ways at least twice during the development project, requiring changes to existing code. (Trivia tidbit: the original Super Famicom plans called for much more extensive onboard 3D hardware--PilotWings was developed assuming that this hardware would be present, and since this chip was scrapped from the Super Famicom at the last minute, Nintendo was forced to include this 3D chip on the PilotWings board in order to keep the game on schedule.) The other reason for difficulty in development is much less known, and very surprising--almost all the programming for these titles was done on the Apple IIgs! This seems ridiculous until you realize that both the Super Famicom and the Apple IIgs are based on the 65816 processor, a cheap toy with inadequate processing power that was stuck in the Super Famicom to smooth over the early development process (since it is backwards compatible with the 6502, the NES\\' processor). However, it was soon realized by the development teams that a reliable 65c816 development platform could not be found on the usual Nintendo platforms (most Nintendo devs at that time had a generic PC, excluding the art and marketing department which was mostly Macintosh and a few segments of the development team). Deadlines approaching, the Apple IIgs was chosen as a quick if inelegant solution--several C and assembly compilers were available, and testing and debugging was easier since we were able to use a native 65816 for testing. However, the IIgs proved woefully inadequate for large projects. Most machines didn\\'t even have hard drives! Compile times for even meager projects were horrendous, and keeping all the work on floppies was getting out of hand. And obviously, the graphics support on IIgs\\' was minimal, so testing out small programs required switching between a Super Fami prototype on the left and a IIgs on the right. Programmers, in general, hated the thought of Super Famicom development. Many continued to write 6502 code using the old NES development environment, choosing to ignore on the 16-bit advantages of the 65816 in order to complete the project without losing their sanity. Nintendo soon pushed its efforts hard into developing a reasonable development platform for Super Famicom (and soon, the Super Nintendo). The project was codenamed Mirage, and several of the key designers of the Super Fami hardware were assigned to the project. Along with full 65c816 emulation, interrupt timing and memory management, the Mirage dev platform offered realtime debugging, code stepping, breakpoints, limited video support and almost instant compile times. Developers were happy, and Mirage proved to be an excellent way to write Super Famicom software in record times. At first, Mirage was anything but a traditional emulator--the video consisted of squares on a black background (showing where sprites would be) and pages of debugging information. It did not run in real-time, there was no controller interface, no SPC700 chip emulation (required for sound), a text-based user interface. It was meant for programmers and used for writing code. Final testing was done on a real Super Fami unit. However, over time, the Mirage project got more advanced. Of course, bugfix after bugfix was added, patching the code to make sure its output matched that of a real Super Fami. A team working on some tricky graphical effects added the first major patch, a separate window (originally forced onto a second monitor) which would render a virtual SNES screen. This process took several seconds on our original hardware--one could watch the screen slowly draw from top to bottom--but it worked, and it was more accurate than most of the emulators you see today. A second team optimized the code, and combined with computer upgrades around the Nintendo offices, this let Mirage run in pseudo-realtime, although it was a fraction of the speed of a real Super Famicom. It soon became common to test games on Mirage more and more extensively. Developers found that the time needed to load their code from Mirage into the testing units (up to a minute for large games) was excessive, when with a click of the mouse they were able to immediately see the game running within Mirage. Of course, there were a lot of limitations, and nobody would argue that Mirage could replace a real unit, but it was a start. This is where the story gets interesting. In late 1996, a high-level executive (who will remain anonymous) at Nintendo came to the Rare labs one day, and saw a coder working on his game using Mirage. (Trivia tidbit: Yes, Rare has many of its development labs within Nintendo of America headquarters nowadays -- they were always in bed together, now more recently they\\'ve even shacked up. Diddy Kong Racing -- shudder.) By now, computer hardware had advanced to allow Mirage to run at playable speeds on this guy\\'s average desktop hardware. Suddenly the potential struck him -- Super Nintendo games on household PCs! Obviously there\\'s a market. Nintendo of Japan shrugged off the idea, but they always have -- NOJ is known for passing over potentially valuable markets, and focusing on selling elaborate junk to young children (Virtual Boy, anyone?). On the other hand, Nintendo 64 has not been the blockbuster that was hoped for in the US market; obviously the higher-ups overestimated the market for $79 games designed for kids when competing systems sell their games for $39. Regardless, the project Silhouette was spun off from Mirage in an attempt to broaden Nintendo\\'s market to PC owners, especially those who liked SNES software. Silhouette had two main developers, myself being one of them; the Mirage team also worked on large portions. Silhouette was designed to be a subset of Mirage; its purpose was to play games, and be as optimized as possible for today\\'s computer hardware, but be as accurate as possible. No debugging windows, no test modes, no compiler--just the emulated hardware, with the best possible gaming experience. Every attempt was made in Silhouette\\'s course of development to obtain speed without sacrificing compatibility. In many cases Silhouette was forced to expand to include features that Mirage did not cope with. For example, Mirage had no sound support whatsoever--Silhouette includes a full SPC700 APU emulator, designed by myself and my partner from the ground up. Original versions of Silhouette also included an encryption scheme to prevent customers from hacking the software and using ROM images other than the game included with the emulator; the version you have does not include this encryption, however. An interesting note is that most employees at Nintendo had no idea that other people had already thought of SNES emulation until very recently. The entire SNES9X cancellation story is a huge mess of bad PR for Nintendo, but it couldn\\'t be helped--if a Super Nintendo emulator were released as freeware (along with the heavy ROM piracy that is characteristic of the Internet), the market for Silhouette would be slim to none. Nintendo\\'s efforts in combatting ROM image piracy have always been swift and effective, and frankly I feel nothing but satisfaction seeing ROM pirates get shut down. Try watching your colleague\\'s or friend\\'s hours and hours of labor get translated into a ZIP file and get spread across the Internet and see how it makes you feel. Piracy sucks, people--don\\'t use Silhouette as a vehicle for piracy. Unfortunately, as you can see, Silhouette did not make it into stores nationwide as planned. Within the past few months, Nintendo of America has undergone some extensive reorganizations and layoffs. Much of the blame for this rests with the current state of N64 sales (let\\'s just say we\\'re not doing so well; Sony destroyed us this Christmas). The high-level executive who brainstormed Silhouette lost his job in the red tape. After that, it was only a matter of time before the word came down from NOJ to axe the Silhouette project, still unfinished. That ended my career at Nintendo, since Silhouette had been my only major project at Nintendo for several months and I had nothing to do after the project was gone. I packed my bags and made sure to get a copy of Silhouette on Zip disk before taking off. I\\'m pretty sure that Silhouette is dead at Nintendo. In fact, I wouldn\\'t be surprised if they denied that it ever existed, at this point. But let the facts speak for themselves--here\\'s Silhouette, now on your hard drive. Have fun. Due to the facts behind this program\\'s development, and the confidential nature of Silhouette, my colleague and I chose to release Silhouette only under anonymity. Most of all, please enjoy Silhouette! It\\'s got a lot of hard hours of work invested into it, and although I know there\\'s a lot of rough edges--transparency masking, for example, is all wrong, and the SPC700 really needed a little more testing--it really is the best out there. Special thanks to whoever drew these icons--I lifted them off another emulator in haste, since I am not an artist. Future versions of Silhouette may emerge from time to time. No promises, and no release dates -- I have already gotten myself a new job where I\\'m extremely happy, but the days are long and you can only program for so many hours in a day. Have fun, and thanks for trying Silhouette! -- Silhouette Public Release 1.0, 1/1/98',\n",

       " 'Science can’t yet tell us whether they have more fun – but it has uncovered a new genetic change that makes people blonde. And contrary to long held belief, it seems golden hair hasn’t simply been introduced across the globe by travelling tow heads, but instead evolved separately in different human populations.\\n\\nIndigenous people of the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific have some of the darkest skin pigmentation outside of Africa. But unlike most other tropical populations, they also have a high prevalence of blonde hair. Up to 10 per cent of the population is fair haired, the highest proportion outside of Europe. Until now, this odd trait had generally been attributed to the introduction of blonde genes by European explorers and traders in preceding centuries. “We originally thought, well that must be a Captain Cook allele,” says Carlos Bustamante at Stanford University.\\n\\nYet a closer look revealed that the genetics behind blonde hair in Brussels are distinct from those leading to flaxen locks in the South Pacific.\\n\\nBustamante, Sean Myles and colleagues at Stanford discovered this after analysing saliva samples from 43 blondes and 42 dark-haired Solomon Islanders. A genome-wide scan pointed to a single strong difference between the groups at a gene called TYRP1. Further analysis revealed that a single-letter change in the gene accounted for 46 per cent of the population’s hair colour variation, with the blonde allele being recessive to the dark hair allele. The blonde mutation wasn’t found in any of the 900 other individuals sampled from outside the South Pacific (Science, DOI: 10.1126/science.1217849).\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTYRP1 is known to be involved in skin and hair pigmentation in several species. In normally black mice, for example, a mutation in the gene produces light brown coats. A rare kind of human albinism is also caused by mutations in TYRP1, which produces reddish skin colour and ginger hair. TYRP1 isn’t, however, one of the genes that produces blonde hair in Europeans. The novel blonde mutation in Solomon Islanders is likely to have cropped up around 10,000 years ago, and it appears to be the same one behind blondness in Fiji and other regions of the South Pacific.\\n\\n“Before this, everybody would have thought, blonde hair evolved once in humans,” says Bustamante. “This tells us we can’t really assume that even these common mutations are common across different human populations. Non-European populations are critical to study to find mutations that may be underlying the vast phenotypic variation of humans.”',\n",
       " '“And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.” Genesis 17:24-25 (The Israel Bible™)\\n\\nThe end of days are quickly approaching, announced a prominent Israeli rabbi, as the “difficult security situation in Israel” heats up.\\n\\nIn a video making the rounds online, Rabbi Yitzchak Yosef Amar, the former Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, is seen hosting Rabbi Baruch Abuhatzeira, known as the Baba Baruch and son of the late Baba Sali, who was one of the greatest Kabbalists of our generation. In a markedly uncharacteristic manner, the Baba Baruch related to present events in Israel and their connection to the imminent arrival of the Messiah.\\n\\nIn the video, which was broadcast to hundreds of thousands of viewers, Rabbi Baruch spoke about “the difficult security situation in Israel” but reassured his audience by saying the hard times were almost over.\\n\\n“It is finished and from today on, the years in which Ishmael (the Arabs) rule over the Jews are finished,” he stated. “There are signs the Messiah is imminent.”\\n\\nBeseeching God, Rabbi Baruch called out, “Enough already! The nation of Israel can no longer bear it. Everything that is happening today, in Israel and all over the world, may the evil ones be cursed, it is spoken about in Kabala.”\\n\\nRabbi Baruch then related what is written in the Zohar, Judaism’s central mystical Jewish text, regarding the divine reward for the nation of Ishmael and its ultimate downfall.\\n\\n“Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai (a sage from the Second Temple period) said that the ministering angel of Ishmael stood in front of God and petitioned him, saying, ‘Anyone who does a mitzvah (good deed) should receive a reward. Ishmael circumcised himself. And not just at eight days, but when he was 13 years old! Does he not earn merit for this?’”\\n\\nRabbi Baruch taught, “The Zohar says that God answered, saying that the land of Israel will be given to them during the time that it will be empty of Jews, after the destruction of the Temple.”\\n\\n“That is exactly what happened,” he continued. “God gave Ishmael 100 years for every year until he was circumcised; 1,300 years to rule in the land of Israel. Now we see that the end of this time has come. They were here, they ruled over the land, they received their reward, now it is time for the Nation of Israel to rule in their land. It is time for the messiah and the redemption, when Israel will rule over all of the land. Not this part belonging to them and this part belonging to us.”\\n\\nRabbi Baruch concluded his message with a special blessing: “With God’s blessing, we will merit seeing this with our own eyes, the arrival of the Messiah, who will subdue them and send them out from our land.”\\n\\n',\n",

(Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)\\n\\nFormer B.C. finance minister Kevin Falcon once referred to the PST as a \"stupid tax,\" for its complications and exemptions.\\n\\nBut he was one of many Liberals quick to admit the government employed a bone-headed strategy to sell the HST to British Columbians.\\n\\nBarely three months after winning its third consecutive term in May 2009, Campbell\\'s Liberal government announced it had accepted Ottawa\\'s $1.6 billion offer to move to a harmonized federal-provincial tax system.\\n\\nThe announcement was viewed with skepticism, especially since B.C. had consistently rejected previous federal offers to move to the HST.\\n\\nThe federal cash offer and the potential gold mine for business now appealed to Campbell\\'s Liberals who were virtually silent on the HST in the past, but now faced a massive budget deficit voters didn\\'t know about during the election campaign.\\n\\nAlmost immediately, a grassroots Fight-HST movement began, enlisting former premier Bill Vander Zalm as a spokesman.\\n\\nMore than 500,000 people signed up to oppose the tax, prompting a provincewide referendum on the HST under B.C.\\'s direct democracy laws which allow for recalls of politicians and votes on some initiatives.\\n\\nCampbell resigned mid-term, essentially admitting peoples concerns about his policies had stalled the progress of his government.\\n\\nThe tax went down to defeat in August 2011, but it\\'s taken until now to officially bring back the PST.\\n\\n25,000 B.C. businesses yet to register\\n\\nB.C.\\'s small business minister Naomi Yamamoto said she has some concerns that not every business has properly registered to move to the PST for April 1, but for the most part, it will be business as usual.\\n\\n\"We will see all those permanent exemptions prior to the HST reintroduced,\" she said. \"So, people will not be paying PST on things like gym memberships and restaurant meals, bicycle purchases, haircuts. But for the majority of purchases some may make they will probably see no difference at all.\"\\n\\nYamamoto said about 25,000 businesses have yet to register to collect the PST.

But it\\'s not the Ministry of Finance\\'s intent to audit all of these businesses.\"\\n\\nShe said the ministry wants to help speed the process in any way it can.\\n\\nB.C. chamber of commerce president John Winter said he believes the majority of businesses will be signed up by April 1, but he expects in-store issues in the first few days as customers examine their receipts to see if they were charged taxes or not charged.\\n\\n\"My sense is it\\'s going to be chaotic,\" he said. \"There\\'s going to be a lot of cash register discussions.\"\\n\\nThe provincial government struck a deal with the federal government to pay back the $1.6 billion in the months after the HST was defeated in the referendum.\\n\\nThe money will gradually be returned over the next five years, interest free.\\n\\nFalcon said at the time that getting a break on the interest would save the province $100 million.\\n\\n\"Obviously, in a perfect world, I wish we didn\\'t have to pay back anything,\" the minister told reporters in January last year as he announced the agreement.',\n",

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Californian sports website Bleachreport.com dared to publish an article with 25 bold predictions for the 2015 January transfer window. No1 of the list was an imminent move of Mario Balotelli from Liverpool to Olympiakos.\\n\\nMario Balotelli’s last performance of great value was against Germany for the Euro 2012 semi-final when he scored two goals to lead Italy to the final against Spain. Since then, the 24 year old’s career has fizzled out. He jumped from Manchester City to AC Milan and then to Liverpool unable to make a decent impression in either club.\\n\\nBrendan Rogers has used him a total of 16 times this season though he’s only managed to score twice and neither of them was for the Premier League. Liverpool’s atrocious run in the English league sees them in eighth place, 17 points behind first placed Chelsea and Manchester city. Consequently, people are brought up to target and the easiest one to blame is usually the team’s bad boy, which at this case is Super Mario.\\n\\nThe €20 million fee paid to bring the young Italian striker to the British port has yet to be depreciated as he has made no eminent impact in the team’s performance and so, tales of his departure are slowly arising.\\n\\nOne of them, has Balotelli moving to Olympiakos. Greece, a paradise for talented players who can still be paid well but also vamp around on the field, has always been the welcome area for cases like Balotelli. Eric Abidal and Javier Saviola to name a few recent ones, or Giovanni Dos Santos and Ze Elias to mention some past ones.\\n\\nAfter all, and this is where the article bases its whole theory, Mario Balotelli’s manager is the well known Mino Raiola (also represents Zlatan Ibrahimovic) who has three Olympiakos’ players under his belt, Gevorg Ghazaryan, Pajtim Kasami and Ibrahim Afellay and another, Vladimir Weiss who recently was sold off. Vaggelis Marinakis’ and Mino Raiola’s relationship is strengthened after their recent deals and as a result a forthcoming transaction between the two of them cannot be omitted.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

His publicist/agent Tom (the best in the business) is here to keep you up to speed. –\\n\\n–\\n\\nPerry is the most unique client I have ever worked with. Even as I type these words, I feel that I’m failing to convey just how challenging representing the man can be. As Perry’s publicist/agent, it’s tremendously challenging to work with someone who’s presently in the system. Of course Perry will be the first to admit that he’s the sole person responsible for putting himself there, but that doesn’t alleviate the considerable challenges we are presented with. How does one represent a client that can’t actually get work?\\n\\nThe answer lies within the “F-word,” and by that, I of course mean faith. My faith in Perry is what keeps me going. I have been asked many times by my colleagues how I can possibly work pro bono for guy that offers so many challenges within the industry. My answer has always been, “I have faith in Perry Caravello.” I have faith that Perry will one day get out of the system, make reparations for his previous misdeeds and become the star that he was always destined to be. However, Perry cannot do this on his own. He has dug himself a rather deep ditch and he’ll need a rope to get himself out. Will he use that rope to pull himself up or will he simply hang himself with it (metaphorically speaking of course)? Time will tell.\\n\\nPerry ran into some problems on Facebook back in February and had to shut things down for a while. First Perry became a proud supporter of N.A.M.B.L.A. (North American Man Boy Love Association) when he proclaimed his love for the notorious group that advocates pedophilia. Perry went as far as posting photos of stickers from the group that were affixed to his car and truck. Supporting this despicable group was of course a very bad decision, though to be fair, Perry was told the group stood for Negative Allegations Made By Legendary Actors. Being a legendary actor himself, Perry was honored with the affiliation.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, Perry made another poor decision when he decided to unleash everyone that was on his blocked list on Facebook. Many of whom were bad people who did not have Perry’s best interest at heart. Within one hour of being freed from the confines of Perry’s blocked list, one such individual took control of Perry’s account. Claiming to be a voice from Perry’s past, this person assumed Perry’s identity and made some wild accusations. Thankfully, the account was eventually restored thanks to help of Don Barris, who had also informed Perry of the true meaning of N.A.M.B.L.A.\\n\\nFor now, Perry has been laying low and trying to keep out of trouble.He’s also been spending hours upon hours watching various television shows. He’s currently obsessed with both “New Girl” and “Breaking Bad.” Perry Caravello is a man who likes to bathe himself in great acting, so he feels the combination of Zooey Deschanel and Bryan Cranston will help him dust off his own acting chops. Those chops will be more than ready to strike when the time comes. Yes, I have faith.\\n\\nBut enough from me, let’s hear from the man himself. I asked Perry if he would be kind enough to write down what he’s been up to over the past couple of months and he generously took the time to shoot this video.\\n\\n-TOM BRENNAN',\n",

Since forced sex trafficking is so rare. These anti prostitution groups need to invent victims in order to get attention and money in to their organizations. Most liars are not sent to jail as they should be. Movies about forced sex trafficking are works of fiction, just like most movies are.\\n\\nPicture of William Hillar – caught lying about Sex Trafficking – He was involved in the movie “Taken”\\n\\nWilliam Hillar\\n\\nGSN magazine\\n\\nA Maryland man who lied about his extensive background as an army special forces officer to get work training law enforcement and first responders in a variety of skills, including anti-terror tactics and drug and human traffic interdiction, has been sentenced on fraud charges.\\n\\nWilliam Hillar, 66, of Millersville, MD, was sentenced Aug. 30 to 21 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release for wire fraud in connection with his scheme to pass himself off as a colonel in the U.S. Army Special Forces with extensive experience overseas, said an Aug. 30 statement by the FBI. Hillar never held such a position, it said, but had been enlisted in U.S. Coast Guard Reserve in the 1960’s. Hillar also falsely claimed, said the FBI, that he was an expert in human trafficking and the film Taken was based on his experiences in recovering his daughter from kidnappers.\\n\\nIn addition to the prison sentence, Hillar was also ordered to pay restitution of $171,415 and perform 500 community hours at the Maryland State Veterans Cemeteries.\\n\\nAccording to court documents, from around 1998 to 2010, private and public sector organizations paid Hillar at least $171,415 for teaching, leading workshops, giving speeches and conducting training on counter terrorism, drugs trafficking, human trafficking and related topics, said the agency. Hillar conducted these activities through a business named “Bill Hillar Training.” Court documents said most of Hillar’s victims were military, law enforcement or first responder organizations.\\n\\nIn order to get consulting jobs with these organizations, Hillar said in resumes, biographical statements, and on the Internet that he was a retired U.S. Army Colonel who had acquired diverse training and experience included tactical counter-terrorism, explosive ordnance, emergency medicine and psychological warfare serving in Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America. He also said he received a Ph.D. from the University of Oregon.\\n\\nHillar never served in the U.S. Army or the Special Forces and never attained the rank of Colonel, said the FBI, nor did he serve in Asia, the Middle East and Central and South America. He didn’t acquire any counter-terrorism, explosive ordnance, emergency medicine and psychological warfare in those areas, it said. Hillar did serve in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve as an enlisted sailor from 1962 to 1970, achieving the rate of Radarman, Petty Officer Third Class.\\n\\nAccording to court documents, the organizations Hillar purported to train perform critical public safety and national security functions, and require ongoing training and education in order to respond to new and changing threats. Hillar, who was not qualified, displaced qualified teachers and trainers, thereby putting members of our military, law enforcement and first responders at risk, said the FBI\\n\\nAdditionally, the FBI said Hillar fabricated a gruesome tale that his own daughter had been kidnapped, forced into sex slavery, sodomized and tortured before being hacked to death with machetes and thrown into the sea. He further claimed that this experience and his life story was the basis for the 2008 film “Taken”. The significant press attention that film generated, in turn, generated free press for his business. Hillar admitted he fabricated the story about his daughter, who was alive and well.\\n\\n“William G. Hillar claimed that he had earned praise as a hero, but the truth is that he deserves condemnation as a liar,” said U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein. “He did not serve in the U.S. Army, did not receive military training in counter-terrorism and psychological warfare, and did not lose his daughter to sex traffickers.”\\n\\n“Mr. Hillar’s fraudulent representations came to the FBI’s attention from concerned citizens, including former members of the Special Forces community. This investigation is an example of the difficulty the public faces trying to verify the accuracy of information on the Internet,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Richard McFeely.\\n\\nhttp://www.gsnmagazine.com/node/24375',\n",

       " 'Alain Johannes may not be a household name just yet, but he’s collaborated with quite a few big-name acts over the years. One of his early projects, What Is This?, saw him performing alongside Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Flea and Hillel Slovak. He’s also produced and played on records by Queens of the Stone Age, Mark Lanegan, Them Crooked Vultures, and Eagles of Death Metal. Now he’s stepping out on his own with his second solo record, Fragments & Wholes, Volume I, and the latest single, “Saturn Wheel”, highlights just how Johannes fits in so easily with all of these hard rocking peers.\\n\\n“‘Saturn Wheel’ is about attraction. Being pulled in by someone’s gravity,” Johannes said in a statement. “And I tried to give it that orbital feeling by keeping the drums cycling in 5/4 with the counterpoint guitars and chorus line guitars moving like rings around the pulse. It makes the flow of the album take a sudden turn after the first two songs and sets the tone for the next track, ‘Swan And Crow,’ which is more earthy and tribal.”\\n\\n\\n\\nListening to “Saturn Wheel”, Johannes’ swirling description feels pretty appropriate. The track kicks off with a rapid, blistering guitar lick, a sonic punch that could have popped up in Josh Homme’s Desert Sessions series. Johannes’ vocals sound ghoulish against all the distortion and mayhem, like an overlord of the underworld. While Johannes may not get all the glory, “Saturn Wheel” shows he’s on par with many of his stoner rock contemporaries.\\n\\nListen in below.\\n\\nFragments & Wholes, Volume I is out November 11th and pre-orders are now ongoing via PledgeMusic.',\n",
       " 'A couple of weeks ago, I noted that the CIA Memorandum for the Record from their February 4, 2003 briefing of Pat Roberts revealed that Bob Graham, Roberts’ predecessor as Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, had attempted to institute some oversight over the CIA’s interrogation program in November 2002. After CIA discouraged the idea in the briefing, Roberts immediately backed off the idea of doing any oversight.\\n\\nRoberts’ [redacted; staffer?] asked me whether I had “taken up the line” the Committee’s, actually Senator Graham’s, late November request to undertake its own “assessment” of the enhanced interrogation. I [Stan Moskowitz, head of Congressional Affairs] explained to Senator Roberts the dialogue I had had with [redacted], and our responce [sic] that we would not support reading another staffer into the program nor allow any staffer to review the interrogations in real time or visit the clandestine site where the interrogations were taking place. Quickly, the Senator interjected that he saw no reason for the Committee to pursue such a request and could think of “ten reasons right off why it is a terrible idea” for the Committee to do any such thing as had been proposed. Turning to [redacted], he asked whether they thought otherwise and they indicated that they agreed with the Senator.\\n\\nI wanted to know what kind of oversight Graham had had in mind, so I asked Senator Graham for an explanation of the reference. According to Graham, a majority of Committee members in November 2002–including a few Republicans–supported conducting oversight of the program. And it seems that CIA mischaracterized to Roberts what Graham had planned, perhaps in an effort to dissuade Roberts from conducting that oversight.\\n\\nGraham reminded me (as I reported last May) that he was never briefed on the abusive techniques the CIA was using. So he didn’t decide to do more oversight of the program because of concerns about the techniques.\\n\\nRather, there was “a lot of smoke” that made it clear “something out of the norm was occurring.” There were “rumors that something was occurring out of the ordinary.” (I asked specifically whether he had heard any rumors about the November 2002 Salt Pit death, but he said he had not.)\\n\\nBut contrary to what the CIA represented to Roberts, Graham wasn’t asking to “review the interrogations in real time.” He was planning initial oversight of the interrogation program. He wanted to ask basic questions about what was going on:\\n\\nWhat’s going on?\\n\\nWho authorized the program?\\n\\nWhat [intelligence] are we getting out of it?\\n\\nGraham told me that “well over a majority” of the committee supported doing such oversight. When I asked, he said Jay Rockefeller, who replaced him as the Ranking Democrat on the Committee, supported the effort. Though Graham didn’t remember precisely who was on the Committee at the time (here’s the list), he named Richard Lugar and Mike DeWine as two of the Republicans who were probably in the majority supporting this kind of oversight over the program.\\n\\nBut between CIA’s apparent misrepresentations to Roberts and Roberts’ own disinterest in asking even the most basic questions about the CIA’s interrogation programs, those efforts ended when Graham left the committee and Roberts took over as Chair.\\n\\nAnd that’s how Pat Roberts and CIA agreed to avoid asking or answering even the most basic questions about the Bush Administration’s torture program.',\n",
       " 'American and Russian astronauts use separate water filtration systems on ISS, as Nasa astronauts also collect Russian urine when available to increase supply\\n\\nWhat’s the difference between American and Russian astronauts on the International Space Station? The Americans drink their urine, the Russians don’t.\\n\\n“It tastes like bottled water,” Layne Carter, water subsystem manager for the ISS at Nasa’s Marshall Space Flight Center told Bloomberg. “As long as you can psychologically get past the point that it’s recycled urine and condensate that comes out of the air.”\\n\\nCondensate is the collected breath and sweat of the crew, shower runoff, and urine from animals on board the station. Specifically, 12 mice that came with the Japanese cargo ship, the Kounotori 5 or White Stork, that successfully docked on Monday.\\n\\nNinety-three percent of all the water on board is reclaimed, according to a video posted by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield while he was on the space station in 2013.\\n\\n“We can recycle about 6,000 extra liters of water for the station each year,” Hadfield said.\\n\\nWhile the Americans are the only ones who filter their urine, both sets of astronauts gather condensate from the air. They have separate water systems and have never agreed on how to filter their water, according to Bloomberg.\\n\\nSince the launch of the Soviet Mir space station in 1986, the Russians have used silver in its ionic form. Nasa has made use of iodine since 1981, when the space shuttle program began. The Americans plan to start using silver since it doesn’t have to be filtered out before consumption, but Carter said he likes that the Americans and Russians employ different methods.\\n\\n“It really makes a lot of sense to have dissimilar redundancies in the space station in case one of the systems has problems,” Carter told Bloomberg.\\n\\nThe station also has approximately 2,000 liters of backup water in case of an emergency. The water is split between the American and Russian sections of the station.\\n\\nBut the US water recycling system produces more than the Russians’ does. Nasa astronauts don’t just filter their own urine – they also use their Russian colleagues’.\\n\\n“We collect it in bags, and then the crew hauls it over to the US side,” Carter told Bloomberg. “We don’t do 100% of the Russian urine. It depends on our time availability.”\\n\\nIn Hadfield’s video, he defended the consumption of filtered urine and condensate.\\n\\n“Before you cringe at the thought of drinking your leftover wash water and your leftover urine, keep in mind that the water that we end up with is purer than most of the water that you drink at home,” he said. “That makes the International Space Station its own self-contained environment. That’s a critical step towards living for long periods off of planet Earth.”',\n",

Τῶν ὄντων τὰ μέν ἐστιν ἐφ᾽ ἡμῖν, τὰ δὲ οὐκ ἐφ᾽ ἡμῖν.\\n\\nThe Enchiridion, or Handbook of Epictetus is a Greek Stoic guide to daily living. It has been read and reread by countless people throughout the centuries because of its sensibility and applicability to daily living. The book was written in ca. 135 A.D. by Arrian, the student of Epictetus. The Handbook is a guide to daily life - a collection of Epictetus\\' best sayings. [Note that the terms Enchiridion, Encheiridion <note the spelling>, Handbook and Manual all refer to the same work]. Epictetus, a Stoic, unlike some of his forefathers in Greek philosophy (i.e. Plato and Aristotle), focuses his attention on how to practically apply oneself on a philosophical level.\\n\\nThe Enchiridion is highly recommended by various professors of Hellenistic Greek, NT Greek and philosophy. Those who are interested in the NT and want to read some secular Greek should read the Enchiridion. Those who only study Attic Greek and Homeric Greek are missing out on one of the most influential pieces of literature in western philosophy; the Enchiridion stands alongside the Apology of Plato as one of the writings you should read many times in your life. While many may have only studied Plato and Aristotle, Epictetus was a significant contributor to philosophy and is included in any well-rounded study of philosophy.\\n\\nWho is Epictetus?\\n\\nEpictetus was a Greek philosopher who lived from 55-120 (or 135?) A.D. He himself never wrote anything down. We know his teachings by the writings of his student Arrian (who is best known as a military historian). Arrian wrote two works on Epictetus: The Discourses and the Encheiridion. The Discourses are the after-school banter of the students, their teacher and discussions with passers-by. The Encheiridion is a collection of his most memorable sayings. The portrayal of Epictetus is different in the Encheiridion than in the Discourses. In the Handbook Epictetus is a statue; in the Discourses he is a man.\\n\\nYou can get to know him a little more by reading the \\'Interview with Epictetus\\' I have created (still being created). His teachings have changed the word \\'Stoic\\' to be what the adjective today implies. The book \"Handbook of Epictetus\" by Nicholas White (Hackett Publishing: Indiana. 1983) has an excellent concise introduction. It can be found at most libraries. Keith Seddon\\'s book Epictetus\\' Handbook and the Tablet of Cebes is a homiletic commentary on the Enchiridion.\\n\\nThe bibliography page has several books which will help you to understand Epictetus and his philosophy. You can find out more about Epictetus and the Enchiridion at Wikipedia and at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (the best article on the internet - also by Keith Seddon).\\n\\nEpictetus in the Suda\\n\\nThe Suda online, a Byzantine Encyclopedia, has the following entry. You can read the English translation on the Suda web site. (The Suda is a massive 10th century Byzantine Greek historical encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world, derived from the scholia to critical editions of canonical works and from compilations by yet earlier authors.)\\n\\nἘπίκτητος, Ἱεραπόλεως τῆς Φρυγίας, φιλόσοφος, δοῦλος Ἐπαφροδίτου, τῶν σωματοφυλάκων τοῦ βασιλέως Νέρωνος. πηρωθεὶς δὲ τὸ σκέλος ὑπὸ ῥεύματος ἐν Νικοπόλει τῆς νέας Ἠπείρου ᾤκησε, καὶ διατείνας μέχρι Μάρκου Ἀντωνίνου: ἔγραψε πολλά. ὅτι Θεοσέβιος ὁ φιλόσοφος ἔλεγε πολλὰ ἀπὸ τῶν Ἐπικτήτου σχολῶν, τὰ δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπετεχνᾶτο τῆς ἠθοποιοῦ διανοήματα μούσης, ἱκανὰ πείθειν καὶ δυσωπεῖν τῶν ψυχῶν τὰς μὴ παντάπασιν ἀτέγκτους καὶ ἀτεράμονας: ἀποστρέφεσθαι δὲ καὶ ἀποδιδράσκειν τὰ χείρω τῆς ζωῆς εἴδη κατὰ δύναμιν, ἀσπάζεσθαι δὲ τὰ ἀμείνω καὶ μεταδιώκειν, καθόσον οἷόν τε παντὶ σθένει: τοιγαροῦν καὶ ἐν συγγράμμασι καταλέλοιπε τοιούτοις τισὶ τὰς ἑαυτοῦ νουθετήσεις οἵοις Ἐπίκτητος πρότερον. καί μοι δοκεῖ ὁ ἀνὴρ γεγονέναι ἄντικρυς, ὡς ἕνα πρὸς ἕνα ἀντιβαλεῖν, ὁ τοῦ καθ\\' ἡμᾶς χρόνου Ἐπίκτητος, ἄνευ μέντοι τῶν Στωϊκῶν δοξασμάτων. ὁ γὰρ Θεοσέβιος οὐδενὸς τοσοῦτον ὅσον τὴν Πλάτωνος ἀλήθειαν ἠσπάζετο καὶ ἐθαύμαζε. καὶ δή τι καὶ συνεγράψατο μικρὸν βιβλίδιον περὶ τῶν ἐν Πολιτείᾳ τῇ μεγάλῃ κεκομψευμένων, τὴν ἀπὸ τῶν θεῶν ἥκουσαν θεοσοφίαν ἐξαίρων λόγῳ: ταύτην γὰρ διαφερόντως ἐτίμα καὶ ἔσεβεν. ἀεὶ γὰρ ἐν τοῖς ἠθικωτέροις φιλοσοφήμασι διατρίβων ἐφαίνετο. καὶ γὰρ εὖ ἐπεφύκει πρὸς εὐζωί̈αν μᾶλλον ἢ ἐπιστήμην, οὐδὲ ταύτην ἡσυχάζουσαν, οὐδὲ ἐν μόναις ταῖς φαντασίαις γυμναζομένην, ἀλλὰ ζῶσαν ἱκανῶς ἐπ\\' αὐτῶν τῶν πραγμάτων. εἰ μὴ γὰρ καὶ τὸν δημόσιον ἐπολιτεύσατο τρόπον, ἀλλὰ τὸν ἴδιον, ὃν καὶ Σωκράτης ἐκεῖνος καὶ ὁ Ἐπίκτητος καὶ πᾶς εὖ φρονῶν μεταχειρίζεται, τὴν ἑαυτοῦ καὶ ἐν ἑαυτῷ πολιτείαν διακοσμῶν: τοῦτο μὲν πρῶτον, ἔπειτα καὶ πρὸς ἄλλους ἐν μέρει καθέκαστον ἰδίᾳ συνισταμένην πρὸς τὸ βέλτιστον.\\n\\nEpictetus\\' Theme\\n\\nThe primary theme in this work is that a person does not need to be driven by external impressions and events, but can find, within himself, happiness and contentment by changing how he thinks about life and about the things that happen to him. Several passages from the Encheiridion will help illustrate this.\\n\\nEncheiridion 8.1 Μὴ ζήτει τὰ γινόμενα γίνεσθαι ὡς θέλεις,\\n\\nἀλλὰ θέλε τὰ γινόμενα ὡς γίνεται καὶ εὐροήσεις Don\\'t seek to have events happen as you wish,\\n\\nbut wish them to happen as they do happen, and all will be well with you. (translation by Boter)\\n\\nIn another example, Epictetus uses the metaphor of a play to describe the plan for a person\\'s life\\n\\nEncheiridion 17.1 Μέμνησο, ὅτι ὑποκριτὴς εἶ δράματος,\\n\\nοἵου ἂν θέλῃ ὁ διδάσκαλος:\\n\\nἂν βραχύ, βραχέος:\\n\\nἂν μακρόν, μακροῦ:\\n\\nἂν πτωχὸν ὑποκρίνασθαί σε θέλῃ,\\n\\nἵνα καὶ τοῦτον εὐφυῶς ὑποκρίνῃ\\n\\nἂν χωλόν, ἂν ἄρχοντα, ἂν ἰδιώτην.\\n\\nσὸν γὰρ τοῦτ᾽ ἔστι,\\n\\nτὸ δοθὲν ὑποκρίνασθαι πρόσωπον καλῶς:\\n\\nἐκλέξασθαι δ᾽ αὐτὸ ἄλλου. Remember that you are an actor in a drama\\n\\nof such sort as the author chooses,\\n\\nif short, then in a short one;\\n\\nif long, then in a long one.\\n\\nIf it be his pleasure that you should enact a poor man, see that you act it well;\\n\\nor a cripple, or a ruler, or a private citizen.\\n\\nFor this is your business,\\n\\nto act well the given part;\\n\\nbut to choose it, belongs to another.\\n\\n\\n\\n(translation by Higginson)\\n\\n\"Epictetus’ own view has some features that do and some features that do not reflect the strict Stoic view of the ideal condition of a human being. To a great extent, he is interested mainly in explaining to people, not how they should understand an ideal condition, but how they can make their own condition somewhat better than it is. For this purpose, he adopts the strategy of persuading them that they should adjust their desires and their attitudes toward them in certain ways, which seem largely to be ways of setting their sights lower, not expecting to have certain desires satisfied, and living with the idea that such desires were not worth satisfying anyway. In many situations, of course, this is a sensible strategy. and Epictetus’ remarks are often interesting in that light. Epictetus himself was a slave during the earlier part of his life, and must have known something of what it was like to have no other strategy available.\" (White. p. 8).\\n\\nThe following key concepts can be found in all of Epictetus: the promise of philosophy, what is really good, what is in our power, making proper use of impressions, the discipline of desire, the discipline of action, the discipline of assent, God, living in accordance with nature, and making progress. (Seddon pp. 9-29).\\n\\nHow Does the Manual Read?\\n\\nEpictetus’ style is not formal or ornate, but neither is it loose or easygoing; and although it is conversational and occasionally colloquial, it is the exact and careful colloquialism of the schoolteacher, with frequent use of verbal repetition to make its point clear and definite. The effect is inevitably a bit stiff, though not in a bad way. (White. Introduction, p.9).\\n\\nEpictetus loved to use metaphors: life is festival, \\'live like at a dinner table\\', every situation has two handles like a jug, an athletic competition and many more. He talks about the little things in life: a stolen lamp, that servant boy who can never get it quite right, the death of a child, your wife and children, the prepping of teen-age girls, having sexual relations, being around people who have no control, worrying about your next meal, etc.\\n\\nThe Enchiridion is a collection of wisdom sayings. The \\'table of sections\\' on the reading page gives an idea of the topics he covers. There are some similarities to the rule books of Christian monasticism and the wisdom literature of Buddhism and Confucianism.\\n\\n\"The excerpts of the Manual are passages Arian organized, selected, and compressed from the full record in order to present Epictetus\\' teaching in a more accessible and memorable form. For a full view of the manual\\'s grounding principles, one needs to look at Epictetus\\' Discourses. Both works talk about the nature of the world at large, human nature, social interaction, personal responsibility and a rational mind\\'s dialogue with itself. <A. A. Long, 2002 Epictetus, A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life, adapted.>\\n\\nBecause of its relevance, the book was adapted by both Christians and Platonists. The Enchiridion was adapted by Christians over the next ten centuries. There are three Christian adaptations - the most significant attributed to Saint Nilius (ca. 400 A.D.) a disciple of St. John Chrysostom. Simplicius, a neo-platonist also wrote a commentary on the Enchiridion in the 6th century A.D. More on these works can be found in the bibliography.\\n\\nHow long is the Enchiridion?\\n\\nThe book is short (5200 words). It is about the same length as the book of Hebrews in the New Testament. There are 53 pericopes divided into 94 sections with an average section being 55 words. Most \\'chapters\\' are only several sentences in length. There are 28 pages of Greek text in the Loeb version.\\n\\nWhere are the Greek Texts?\\n\\nTexts of the Enchiridion can be found at the LetsReadGreek web site (the \\'Reading pages\\' correct come errors in the following two links), Bibliotheca Augustana and the superior Perseus web site hopper-version. If you have never taken a look at the hopper version of Perseus -- go there and give it a whirl. It is a much cleaner and easier to use interface than the standard cgi-bin interface. (The only problem with the Perseus sight, is that the traffic and web-response are often slow due to all those neoclassicists doing their homework.)\\n\\nWe will be using the text from Epicteti Dissertationes ab Arriano Digestae by Heinrich Schenkl (with some minor corrections). editor. Leipzig. B. G. Teubner. 1916 (it is the same text as the Perseus and Bibliotheca Augustana links). The 1895 version is online at Google Books; The 1916 version is available for download from the LetsReadGreek web site. Schenkl\\'s text of the Enchiridion is really the text from Johannes Schweighauser\\'s 1798 Epicteteae Philosophiae Monumenta. The reading for each week\\'s selection will be on a separate web page on the LetsReadGreek web site and also sent out in the weekly GreekStudy email list in html format.\\n\\nThe Loeb version by W. A. Old father (1927 2 vols.) contains an excellent translation and introduction. Schenkl\\'s 1916 edition text differs from the Loeb text in a number of places. The reason for using Schenkl\\'s text is that it is linked to the Perseus vocabulary tools. Those who want to read more of Epictetus, including the Discourses, should purchase the Loeb edition; The Enchiridion is in the second of the two volumes.\\n\\nIs there any Commentary on the Greek Text?\\n\\nThere are at least two modern commentaries on the Enchiridion, one in English and one in French (German, French and Italian works are yet to be fully analyzed by this writer). Neither focuses on the Greek text, although both have notes here or there on hard to understand phrases and vocabulary.\\n\\nI have been spending a lot of time looking around for a commentary (in English) for intermediate and advanced students on the Greek text. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be one available. An excellent Latin commentary on the Greek text can be found in Laurentius Sahl, 1783, Epicteti Enchiridion Graecae et Latinae in usum Studiosae Iuventutis.... Don\\'t let the title fool you - the Greek and Latin texts are present with an extensive commentary contained in the Notes pp. 41-64 and a Greek-Latin vocabulary pp. 76-92. GoogleBooks. The French work by Charles Thurot, Epictete, Manuel . Texte Grec. Paris: Hachette 1903 (the last edition, which I have not seen, is dated 1917) is a great little handbook format with succinct notes for the intermediate student.\\n\\nNo notes on the Greek compare to Upton\\'s Notes which can be found in Schweighauser\\'s Epicteteae Philosophiae Monumenta III. Schweighauser emends and supplements Upton\\'s notes. Schweighauser also includes an Appendix of Greek Words which has many valuable Latin glosses.\\n\\nSchenkl\\'s Index verborum is an adaptation of Schweighauser\\'s appendix and lists many references to parallel passages in the Discourses and Enchiridion and Greek constructions. A pdf extract of Schenkl\\'s 1916 second edition appendix is available for download on the bibliography page.\\n\\nSeveral other Latin editions contain notes on the Greek text. Oliver\\'s 1954 work on Perotti\\'s Enchiridion (written in Latin) also includes many notes. Heyne\\'s Epicteti Enchiridium Graece et Latine also includes notes. I\\'m still looking for Jacobi, Johann Heinrich, 1786: Cebes Gemälde und Epiktet\\'s Handbuch griechisch nebst einem griechisch-deutschen Wort- u. Sach-Register für Schulen und Gymnasien. If anyone out there has a lead on such a text, please let me know.\\n\\nNotes in English are hard to come by. All the modern versions include some notes here or there - usually topical, but sometimes explaining the Greek. I\\'ve been compiling notes on the Greek from various translations, etc. The goal of this site will be to make the Enchiridion notes on the Greek available in English. As time goes on, each section will have notes added and even translate Schweighauser\\'s notes into English, along with providing an index of grammatical constructions for the Enchiridion.\\n\\nIs Hellenistic (Koine) Greek that different from Attic or Homeric Greek?\\n\\nThe differences between Attic and Hellenistic Greek can best be described as one of simplification, augmentation of foreign vocabulary, and hellenization merging of various dialects. Every part of the language shows some changes: pronunciation, inflections (declinations and paradigms), syntax and vocabulary. Grammar was simplified, exceptions were decreased and generalized, inflections were dropped or harmonized, and sentence-construction made easier. A brief comparison by Jay C. Treat can be found on the University of Pennsylvania web site.\\n\\nKoine is easier to learn than learning Attic Greek. If you can read Attic Greek, you can easily read Koine. You will have trouble reading Attic, if you only know Koine. Literary Koine is more \\'clean\\' than the Koine of the New Testament. It does not have Semitic phraseology, words or idioms. It is comfortable with complicated Greek clauses and sentence structures. It uses a much wider range of vocabulary than seen in the New Testament. It does not have the Atticizing tendencies (reverting to the Attic syntax, spelling and declensions) nor the avoidance of later words which in the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D. were put on \\'Do Not Use\\' lists. If you have only studied New Testament Greek, you will have only a slight learning curve reading the Enchiridion, which is primarily one of learning new vocabulary.\\n\\nIf you have only studied Attic Greek, you will have to learn to accept new forms of old words (e.g. ἄν=ἐάν) and/or different meanings for some of the words you already know (e.g. διότι = ὅτι). There are fewer types of conditions (almost no optative conditional sentences.) When you read raw texts and papyri, you will find that spelling errors abound - showing the change in pronunciation that was taking place. (The eventual itacism that results in modern Greek having 5 vowels sound the same and loss of aspiration.) Words used only as nouns have adjectival endings. The mi verbs have new forms (e.g. ἵστημι becomes ἱστάνω); sometimes you see both old and new forms in the same passage. Uncouth words, (i.e. words than no self-respecting Athenian would utter), are now acceptable e.g. βλάπτω as a verb from the classical βλάβη = harm.\\n\\nNote: Some parts of the Enchiridion show both Attistic and Koine forms. This is most likely a sign of Atticism - the tendency for scribes to change a Koine spelling to the Attic spelling. It his highly unlikely Arrian would have written the same word differently in the same sentence. For example, in chapter 12.1 the Koine word κρεῖσσον \\'better\\' and the Attic κρεῖττον appear side by side. Boter has changed both occurances to the Koine form.\\n\\nThe Greek of the Enchiridion.\\n\\nThe Greek of the Enchiridion is what scholars call \\'Literary Koine\\'. The Greek is not especially easy nor extremely difficult. The hardest part of reading Epictetus is learning his somewhat special use of some terms; he uses a deceptively familiar Greek vocabulary. Epictetus himself tried not to talk to laymen (ἰδιώτης vs. φιλόσοφος) in technical terms, but use common terms and situations -- water jugs, bath-houses, family situations, ship-voyages, children, etc. Arrian, who transcribed Epictetus, does use a Stoic termed vocabulary in his writings, though not exclusively. There are a few terms one will have to \\'relearn\\' in order to understand him. There is a special vocabulary page and terms page on this site that will help you in this area.\\n\\nThe Discourses and Enchiridion are written in Koine Greek (the other books of Arrian are written in Attistic style). Koine Greek is the dialect that was commonly spoken throughout the Roman empire from 330 B.C. to about 330 A.D. (From post Aristotle, to the change of the Roman capital to Constantinople). Hellenistic Greek is the language of Plutarch, Polybius, Dio Cassius, Philo, the Apostolic Fathers, Josephus, the New Testament, Epictetus and many other Greek works you probably know by name. (Note: Greek literature is ten times as voluminous as Latin literature. You may think some works are written in Latin because of the Latinized names of the author; they may actually be written in Greek.)\\n\\nThe Enchiridion is written in \\'Literary Koine\\', and is more polished than the New Testament, but not as polished at Attic Greek. You can think of Attic as \\'King James English\\' and Koine as \\'20th Century English. You will not find the spelling errors of the papyri, nor the Hebraisms of the New Testament. You will not find the frequency of the Optative mood that is in Attic, nor the \\'Atticizing\\' tendency that appears in many later Greek writings.\\n\\nThere are few dialogues in the Enchiridion ( the closest is chapter 24); there are many in the Discourses some often hard to follow who is speaking. The Enchiridion is a grouping of separate short independent topics; each section can be read on its own accord. But there is a common thread that ties them together - a progression of sorts. Hadot\\'s 2000 Arrien: Manuel d\\'Épictète has an excellent analysis of the progression of the Enchiridion. The Table of Sections on the Greek text page gives you an idea of how the work proceeds.\\n\\nThe Enchiridion and The New Testament?\\n\\nThere has been a great debate on Epictetus and the New Testament because of similar vocabulary, the similarity in living a just life, and the use of the word \\'God\\'. Epictetus knew of Christians and twice referred to them, once as \\'Jews\\' and later as \\'Gallileans\\'. Several books have been produced on this topic, with the best being Epiktet und das Neue Testament by Adolf Bonhöffer 1911. The book Epictetus and the New Testament by Douglas Sharp 1914 is available on the bibliography page.\\n\\nThere are about 1300 distinct words in the Enchiridion. A quick comparison shows that 825 of them are common with the New Testament vocabulary. 239 words occur in the New Testament more than 50 times; 296 words more than 30 times. 723 words are used only once in the Enchiridion.\\n\\nThe words \\'free\\' and \\'freedom\\' occur some 130 times, that is, with a relative frequency about 6 times that of their occurrence in the NT (the word group occurs 42x in the NT) and twice that of their occurrence in Marcus Aurelius, to take contemporary works of somewhat the same general content. Some words mean the exact opposite of New Testament meanings, e.g.ταπεινός (humility~poverty), and πλεονεξία (greediness~advantage). Some words are used differently than in the New Testament, e.g. σωτηρία and οὐσία.\\n\\nDoes anyone even study Epictetus anymore?\\n\\nThe history of Western philosophy has always included three groups of study in addition to studying Plato and Aristotle. The Stoics, Epicureans and Skeptics have all made significant contributions to Western thought. Epictetus comes at the end of 500 years of Stoic philosophy. There has been a renewal of interest in the last 20-30 years in Epictetus.\\n\\nHe has been quoted often in Tom Wolfe\\'s best selling novel A Man in Full. Vice-Admiral James Stockdale (Ross Perot\\'s running mate in the US 1992 presidential race) wrote several books on how Epictetus\\' philosophy helped him survive six years in a POW camp in Vietnam. Many self-help books are actually following the Enchiridion in both model and method. A number of new translations and commentaries have also come out. These can all be found on the Bibliography page.\\n\\nHow does the Group Work?\\n\\nThe Enchiridion Hellenistic Reading group is a new part of the GreekStudy group; the GreekStudy group has been in existence since 1995. Each day, the GreekStudy Group sends an email containing translation collations and other relevant emails from various groups. Translation collations, assignments and grammar question collations are in the Greekstudy emails. In addition, this web site will have content, questions, answers which the email correspondence cannot provide.\\n\\nThis group is a reading and study group. The goal is to improve your Greek reading skills; not your translation skills. To do this, we focus on grammar and vocabulary. Translations are not required -- you may just read and answer the grammar and topic questions. Many will want to do both. See the Enchiridion Study page and the Reading Schedule page for further information\\n\\nLike Aesop\\'s fables, the Enchiridion is a collection of sayings, though not as eclectic as Aesop. One can pop in and out of the reading group without feeling like they have missed half the story.\\n\\nThe each weekly reading will have a 1) Required, 2) Optional and 3) Advanced component. Some people will participate in all three areas, and some only in the Required. The Required and Optional readings, are from the Enchiridion and are about 200 words long in total. The Advanced reading will be from the Discourses of Epictetus, one of the Christian Adaptations which parallels the Enchiridion or from the Commentary of Simplicius on the Enchiridion.\\n\\nDiscussion of Stoic philosophy is outside the GreekStudy purview. This site is for those who desire to read and understand the Greek text, not Epictetus\\' philosophy as a whole. The International Stoic Forum (a Yahoo group) is the correct place for such discussions and emails.\\n\\nWhat do I need to do to participate?\\n\\nJoin the GreekStudy group if you have not already. It can be found at http://www.quasillum.com/study/greekstudy.php. Sign up for the Enchiridion interest list by sending an email to llsorenson-TheAtSign-hotmail.com or to epictetus-theatsign-letsreadgreek.com. Some emails are sent out only to interest members. And if you don\\'t already own it, purchase A Greek Grammar by Herbert Weir Smyth; it is a must have book for the intermediate and advanced Greek student.\\n\\nIt is my plan to tie the Greek grammar to the following works: Mastronarde (Introduction to Attic Greek), Mounce (Basics of Biblical Greek) , Smyth (A Greek Grammar), Funk (A Beginning-Intermediate Grammar of Hellenistic Greek), Wallace (Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics) and Morwood (Oxford grammar of Classical Greek). Smyth is the base grammar which all questions will be tied to.\\n\\nWhen the group starts, you will need to do the reading each week and send in your answers to the grammar/vocabulary questions and optionally do the translation. The format for sending in collations to the GreekStudy list can be found on the group assignment format page and in the weekly Enchiridion GreekStudy email.\\n\\nWhat is the Schedule?\\n\\nThis study group will be reading through the Enchiridion in two sessions. The assignment for specific weeks can be found on the Enchiridion Reading Schedule.\\n\\nEnchiridion I Reading Schedule: Chapters 1-26 (Beginning March 24, 2008)\\n\\nEnchiridion II Reading Schedule: Chapters 27-53 (later in the year)\\n\\nI\\'m New to Greek, Can I Join?\\n\\nIf you are finishing up your first year of Greek, consider participating in just the Basic Group. You will have studied most of the forms except for some participles, the subjunctive and optative moods, the dual (not used in Hellenistic Greek), the mi-verbs (shame on your teacher). You should know all the noun declensions, adjective declensions and primary and secondary verb endings of the indicative and imperative moods, along with infinitives. You should be able to follow most of the Enchiridion Greek text without too much trouble. You will have to learn some new vocabulary words.\\n\\nI am trying to key the grammar in the sections to both Mastronarde (Introduction to Attic Greek) and Mounce (Basics of Biblical Greek). These beginning grammars are the most comprehensive, the most organized and complete beginning grammars I have seen. They are like a beginning reference grammar and will be of great help. So if you have time, by all means, join in.\\n\\nGoals of this Project\\n\\nThe goal of this project is to create a site that provides a starting point for would-be beginning and intermediate readers of the Enchiridion in Greek. While the site does provide some references to scholarship on Epictetus, the primary focus is to a create \\'Readers Enchiridion,\\' complete with vocabulary aids, grammatical aids and audio files. Cross-references of grammatical structures to Smyth\\'s Greek Grammar (especially) and other beginning Greek grammars will be referenced where possible.\\n\\nNotes on the Greek text will be collected from existing scholarship, commentaries and treatises. Notes will be provided for each section of the Enchiridion. The notes will point out the between Koine and Attic Greek, special uses of vocabulary, stylistic tendencies of Arrian, Stoic philosophical terms and concepts. Both beginning and intermediate notes will be included.\\n\\nA \\'beginner\\'s\\' bibliography is also included, along with as many links to works that reference the Enchiridion. The bibliography focuses on primarily on the Greek (and Latin) texts and only lists the most influential and popular works on the Enchiridion. It is not intended to be a complete or authoritative bibliography on Enchiridion scholarship.\\n\\nThe most popular and important Latin translations will be be provided. A Latin-English glossary will also be provided.\\n\\nLong-term, I hope to be able to do the following:\\n\\nCreate a complete parsed file of the text of the Enchiridion\\n\\nCreate an analysis of the Enchiridion in the OpenText.org format\\n\\nTranslate Upton\\'s notes into English\\n\\nTranslate Thurot\\'s notes into English\\n\\nTranslate Schweighauser\\'s notes into English\\n\\nAdd additional notes (both Greek grammar and topical)\\n\\nLink the Enchiridion to Blass DeBrunner\\'s grammar\\n\\nCreate a complete and accurate Greek-English lexicon of the Enchiridion\\n\\nLink the parallel sections and cross-references in Schenkl\\'s appendix to the text of the Discourses and Enchiridion\\n\\nCreate a Greek-English diglott of the Golden Sayings of Epictetus\\n\\nPossible other areas of interest\\n\\nTranslate Schweighausers/Schenkl\\'s apparatus into English.\\n\\nTranslate Bonhoffer\\'s \\'Epictet und das Neue Testament\\' into English.\\n\\nExpand the lexicon to include the Discourses.\\n\\nWho is in charge of the group?\\n\\nAll participants make the group happen. Louis Sorenson is the coordinator the the Enchiridion Greek study group and is responsible for the content on this web site. Feel free to correct any errors, misstatements, copyright issues or other questions regarding the web site to epictetus<TheAtSign>letsreadgreek<dot>com.\\n\\nWho am I? I have been studying Greek from 1976-1989 and again with renewed interest from 2005-2008. My personal focus is on Hellenistic Greek, but I enjoy Attic and Homeric works equally. I love Homer and Aristophanes. I have undergrad majors in Linguistics, Classics, Greek, Near Eastern Studies and Bible; a minor in Biblical Greek and Education -- all quite dated. I have also had several years of Latin, German, and Hebrew under my belt.\\n\\nWhy do I put so much work into this endeavor? I have a hard time doing anything half-way. I want to encourage others to go further in Greek studies. Historically, there has been a lack of available and easy to use intermediate reading tools and texts. Everyone says \\'you need to read the Enchiridion\\', but there are no Greek commentaries available for the intermediate student. Making the Enchiridion simple, organized and interesting is my goal, especially since there is no readily available English commentary on the Greek text.\\n\\nWhat\\'s my philosophy about learning to read ancient Greek? There are four basic underpinnings of a successful Greek student: learning vocabulary, memorizing forms, reading large amounts of unfamiliar Greek and motivation; without all four, you will fail.\\n\\nA word of warning. Many software-based Greek-language tools have emerged in the last 10 years. These tools are often used improperly. New students who use these tools as a crutch will never be able to pick up a Greek text and start reading without them. \"What is a crutch?\" you ask? Utilizing a vocabulary link rather than memorizing basic vocabulary words; Clicking on a parsing link without trying to figure out what lemma the form is from and why it appears as it is. Yes, times have changed, but the goal is to read without a grammar and lexicon or online tools. Try reading a passage with just using Smyth\\'s Grammar and the small LSJ lexicon like your parents and grandparents did. There is a reason they decided to increase their vocabulary and learn the forms. Looking up a word numerous times was extremely tedious and took much longer than clicking on a link.\\n\\nI think that reading Greek is only half the effort; understanding what a person is saying is the other half. I like to focus on the way words are used, the range of a word\\'s use, sentence structure and style. Hopefully, this web site, will encourage you and provide you the resources you need to become successful and fluent in ancient Greek. Best of luck and best wishes!',\n",
       " 'A Government backbencher has abstained on votes on the draft terms of reference of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Related Matters.\\n\\nTánaiste Joan Burton described Labour TD Anne Ferris\\' differences with the Government over its draft order as a \"slight\" one.\\n\\nMs Ferris, who spent her first days in a mother-and-baby home, criticised the lack of objectivity in the Government\\'s selection of the 14 individual institutions the commission is to investigate.\\n\\n\"This inquiry requires great sensitivity, an open door and a listening ear for all the witnesses to this dark corner of Ireland\\'s past, regardless of the title above the door of the institution where they once lived\".\\n\\nShe said the sorrow and cruelty endured by all former residents was equal, and that legislators should not discriminate against some.\\n\\n\"I therefore cannot put my name to this proposal,\" she said.\\n\\nHer remarks were greeted with applause in the chamber.\\n\\nThe Labour Party leadership tonight said there is \"no question of disciplinary action\" against Ms Ferris over her abstention on the two votes.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Ms Burton said that the party recognises Ms Ferris\\' concerns with the Government motion \"because of her own personal story and appreciates how very difficult this issue has been for her\".\\n\\nSinn Féin deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald demanded that thousands of excluded survivors, including former residents of Co Wicklow\\'s former Protestant Westbank Orphanage, be added to the commission\\'s remit.\\n\\nShe told Minister for Children James Reilly, who is steering the measure through the Oireachtas, that if all these victims and survivors represent an experience of second class citizenship, then those he \"chose to exclude are now doubly hurt as second class victims\".\\n\\nShe said it was important to identify those who bore criminal responsibility for abuse of women and children, and argued that reparations where necessary in the service of justice.\\n\\nMs McDonald said: \"We\\'re not satisfied with the commission\\'s terms of reference, not least because it will surely and by design exclude from its remit and consideration literally thousands of victims of human rights violations.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no guarantee here for the Magdalene women previously and wrongly denied the right to a full Commission of Investigation into their particular institutional experience; no guarantee for the illegally adopted or fostered or boarded out children whose very worst experiences may well fall outside the express terms of this commission\\'s remit.\"\\n\\nLabour backbencher Robert Dowds sought clarification from the minister.\\n\\nHe said people who had been in institutions not listed by the Draft Order on the terms of reference should be told whether it is possible for them to contribute to the commission\\'s work.\\n\\n\"Some representatives of survivors of Protestant institutions want to know whether their stories can be told,\" said Mr Dowds.\\n\\nHe added that the testimony of survivors of excluded Catholic institutions was no less important.\\n\\nRichard Boyd Barrett, the adopted son of an unmarried mother, welcomed the State\\'s \"belated response\" to survivor power and appealed to Minister Reilly \"not to fall at the last hurdle\".\\n\\nHe urged Mr Reilly to include the full range of bodies responsible for abusing unmarried mothers and their children.\\n\\nHe said a \"complete architecture of repression\" had worked as \"an integrated whole\" and that full redress should be given to all who sought it.\\n\\nAnother adoptee, Tánaiste Joan Burton, said Ms Ferris and she had a slight difference over the terms of reference.\\n\\nShe said she had sought legal advice and is confident there will still be scope for former residents of those institutions not specified in the terms of reference to be heard.\\n\\nThe Labour Party leader also emphasised that Temple Hill, in Blackrock, Co Dublin, the Catholic institution from which she was adopted, is not on the list of 14 institutions to be investigated.\\n\\nYet she knew many of her \"co-graduates\" who were going to contribute to the commission.\\n\\nReplying to the debate, Minister Reilly said he had responded to some legislators\\' concerns by making a technical amendment to definitively include widows and separated women who lived in the homes in the commission\\'s remit.\\n\\nThe Minister for Children and Youth Affairs said he recognised Ms Ferris\\' disappointment that the former Westbank Home in Greystones, Co Wicklow is not included but stressed that the decision was \"thought out at length and has the support of Government\".\\n\\nThe minister sought to assuage doubts by highlighting clause six in the draft terms of reference permitting the commission to recommend further investigations.\\n\\nHe told the House he believed it would allow the commission to hear the stories of those who spent time in orphanages not specified in the terms of reference and to make a further determination to recommend to him what further investigations might take place.',\n",
       " 'Looking Back\\n\\nDigging through some old filesystem backups this weekend, I came across the following directory:\\n\\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 tseaver tseaver 4096 1998-06-20 18:31 ./ drwxrwxrwt 19 root root 20480 2008-06-22 13:15 ../ -rw-r--r-- 1 tseaver tseaver 8455 1998-06-20 23:46 biblio.py\\n\\nIt turns out that that script was my very first \"real\" Python program, written just after finishing the tutorial section of the original edition of Mark Lutz\\' Programming Python [1]. The job of the script was to make the a small research library\\'s catalog available for ad-hoc searches, first via a Tk interface, and later as a CGI script.\\n\\nThe most interesting thing about the application today is that I could do both of those tasks within hours of starting the application, having just learned the language. It did neither of them terribly well (at least by my standards today), but it solved a real problem for a real client, at very little cost.\\n\\nFinding Python\\n\\nUp to that summer, I had been earning my keep as a senior developer / software architect on very large C++ / CORBA applications, with some server-side Java / CORBA thrown in for good measure. I was unhappy with the available tools for testing such applications, in particular because they were nearly as rigid to build as the applications-under-test. I had been following the evolution of what came to be called Extreme Programming on the \"mother-of-all wikis\"[2], and wanted to make testing a more central part of my toolkit.\\n\\nAfter searching a bit, I found Fnorb[3], a Python-based CORBA ORB, which promised a more \"scripty\" way to write my test applications. I went on to write literally a thousand such tests that summer, vastly improving the test coverage for the CORBA apps, and making what felt like enormous strides in both my productivity and my knowledge of Python. I was able to set up the testing jig as a simple CGI application, allowing anybody on the team to run one or all of the available tests, and review the results in their web browser, without having to install or learn Python at all, which was a big win for the project.\\n\\nIPC7 and the birth of Zope\\n\\nAlmost by chance, I learned just a week or so beforehand that the Seventh International Python Conference was being held in Clear Lake, just south of Houston, where I lived at the time. I registered and showed up, knowing nobody in the Python community. I felt right at home, and was able to talk to Martin Chilvers, the original author of Fnorb.\\n\\nMore crucially, it was at this conference that Paul Everitt announced that Digital Creations would be open-sourcing their web application server, Principia, under a not-yet-decided name. I had looked briefly at Bobo, the precursor to Zope\\'s publisher, during the summer, and was interested in following the new development. I subscribed very early on to the main Zope list, and have been using / developing / promoting / cursing it ever since (in no particular order, sometimes all in one day :).\\n\\n\"When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.\"[4]\\n\\nI began using Zope to build project intranets, especially using ZWiki[5], and in fact contributed the \"classic Wiki\" markup implementation to that project. I was also interested in extending my CORBA stuff to integrate with Zope, and began talks with Rob Page and Paul Everitt about what such and integration might look like. They suggested that we continue the discussion at the IPC in Washington (late January 2000). I came to the conference and learned a lot more, deciding that I would consider leaving self-employed status for a shot at the \"dot-com brass ring\" with Digital Creations.\\n\\nI spent five years there, driving several big projects and taking on the job of shepherding the CMF (nee PTK) to maturity. As the company changed directions, from a services-based model to one built around products, and later hosting, I found myself less useful, and less comfortable, and finally left the company to return to self-employed status.\\n\\nSince then, I formed a new company, Agendaless Consulting[6], with two other ex-DC/ZC veterans, Chris McDonough and Paul Everitt. We continue to do mostly Zope and Plone based consulting, and have kicked off a new effort, \"Repoze\"[7], which aims to make Zope development fit in better with other Python frameworks, while making some of Zope\\'s innovations easier to use within those frameworks.\\n\\nLessons Learned\\n\\nSo, looking back over ten years\\' of Python web programming, what stands out?\\n\\n\"Reuse is hard\". Because Python often makes it easier to rewrite a feature than to reuse a version which \"does almost what I want,\" folks often don\\'t pay enough attention to factoring out the reusable bits from those which are of only local interest.\\n\\n\"Persistence means always having to say you\\'re sorry.\" (I\\'ve jokingly referred to this as \"Seaver\\'s Law of Software Engineering\"). The obvious corrolary is that any system should build in a way to dump and reload precious data from any persistent store, into some format which can be read / manipulated by tools other than those which created it.\\n\\n\"Repeatability is way undervalued.\" We still see lots of cases where the application can only be made to work on one box or OS, or where code is not checked in to a VCS, or where a new developer on a project can flail for weeks without becoming productive. Paying the up-front tax to make the system software trivially reproducible on any POSIX- compliant box pays enormous dividends over the life of any non-trivial project.\\n\\n\"Testing is no place to get fancy.\" The temptation to factor out \"reusable\" parts of a testing framework is nearly always a bad idea. Tests need to be clear, simple, and test exactly one thing, or they lose their value. Tests which depend on features not impelmented in the module they are supposed to test end up being fragile and slow, as well as tending to do poorer coverage of the moule-under-test.\\n\\n\"The usefulness of a given framework seems inversely proportional to its size.\" Frameworks are about expressing a given feature in terms of interactions between unvarying logic (implemented in the framework itself), and varying logic (implemented in plugins). The chance that a given framework does what you want is better if it does only that thing.\\n\\nLooking Forward\\n\\nI am quite optimistic about where we are going from this point. I see a lot of shared expectations among Python web developers about sharing code and ideas across project boundaries, and am particularly excited about the trend toward assembling applications from independent parts, using WSGI[8]. I think we could be moving toward a shared platform for web development, consisting of a broad spectrum of high-quality components, made to be combined together using the loose coupling provided by the WSGI specification.\\n\\nBecause WSGI allows composing elements together into what is colloquially referred to as a \"pipeline\" (really a functional composition), the mental model I have for this new platform is one of plumbing together components using standardized connetors (pipes), creating systems which are both agile in the face of changing requirements and simpler to understand, compared to the more monolithic solutions I have seen (and helped build) in the past.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] http://safari.oreilly.com/0596009259\\n\\n[2] http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges\\n\\n[3] http://fnorb.sourceforge.net/\\n\\n[4] Hunter S.

       " \"Fr. Jose Alexis DaVila (Photo: Screen capture)\\n\\nFr. Jose Alexis Davila was convicted of inappropriately touching a 19-year-old woman in San Diego in 2011. Like most priests who have been caught or convicted of sex acts, Davila went to another church. The problem, however, is no one at the church was told about his crimes.\\n\\nWhen the church of the Blessed Sacrament in Lawton, Oklahoma was introduced to Davila they were told only that “he has pastoral experience in the United States” but nothing about his criminal past or even the name of his previous church. None of the members hand any idea he was convicted for groping a teenager, according to KFOR News.\\n\\n“We’re very alarmed by this,” said David Clohessy, executive director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. “This is precisely the pattern that’s been in the Catholic Church for decades and it’s amazingly irresponsible.”\\n\\nFollowing Davila’s conviction, the church decided he was worthy of being reinstated and “fit to minister” to the public again. His sentence from the judge was three years probation and 150 hours of community service.\\n\\nIt seems, after serving his time, he left for another place his past wasn’t known. He’s now serving the small communities of Elgin, Apache and Sterling in Oklahoma. The combined population of these cities is a little over 4,000 people.\\n\\n“Yes he deserves a second chance but not in a position of trust and responsibility and authority and respect like a priest,” Clohessy explained. “And certainly not with no warnings to families around him. If a clergyman or woman abuses his authority and takes sexual advantage of a teenager we really think it should be exactly what the bishops promised it would be and that’s ‘one strike and you’re out.'”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don’t condemn a person for a maybe one-time offense,” said Fr. Michael Chapman, claiming that he believed Davila who promised the inappropriate touching of the teenager was an accident. “We don’t have a congregation of saints, we have a congregation of sinners, including the lead sinner, who is the priest.”\\n\\nUnderstandably, some members are a little uneasy about the Davila. Parishioner Janet Bullard fears for her family saying, “I have niece and nephews and I wouldn’t feel comfortable with this person working with any children. It’s hurtful this kind of stuff. It puts a stain on the church. Most of these people are good decent people and these scandals really hurt a lot of people and really ran a lot of people out of the church.”\\n\\nThe is the second story I’ve written in the last eight days about a church that hired someone convicted of a sex crime and didn’t tell their congregation about it.\\n\\nCheck out the full story from KFOR below:\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"Up to 80 per cent of women in Pakistan's jails are charged under rules that penalise rape victims. But hardliners have vetoed an end to the Islamic laws\\n\\nIn the blinding white desert sunlight in a farm courtyard on the outskirts of the ancient town of Shekhupura, Fareeda nervously passes a green silk hijab between her fingers. Unusually for a young Pakistani woman, her fingernails are not pristine and carefully painted but chewed, cracked and grubby.\\n\\nFareeda says she feels safe here - a safe house for rape victims run by a local NGO. Littered with rusting motorcycle carcases and parts of discarded fridges and cookers, it feels like a scrapyard.\\n\\nThe story of this 19-year-old's journey here is horrifying. In spring 2005 she was raped by her family's neighbour, a postman, and his teenage son. She fell pregnant - and later miscarried - as a result. Her mistake was to tell her parents. With their consent, under Pakistan's orthodox Islamic laws, she was charged with fornication outside marriage and sentenced to 100 lashes, later reduced to 50 and then 25 because of her age, and sent to jail. After four months her prison ordeal ended when a family friend secretly paid a bribe. Her plight is not unique.\\n\\nAccording to a recent report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, a woman is gang-raped every eight hours in the country. However, because of social taboos, discriminatory laws and the treatment of victims by police, campaigners believe the real figure is far higher. Women who report their rapists remain more likely to go to prison themselves than see justice, so most cases are never reported. Women who are raped can face legal difficulties anywhere in the world, but human rights groups remain particularly concerned over Pakistan's record. Their alarm is centred on enforcement of the 'Hudood ordinances', a complex set of Koranic laws whose name is derived from hud meaning 'punishment'. Similar sharia laws have existed in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Sudan for centuries, but Pakistan's were enacted by former President Zia ul-Haq only in 1979, as part of his radical attempt to 'Islamicise' the country.\\n\\nThe legislation has always been full of legal ambiguities, and none more so than the Zina ordinance which deals with adultery, premarital sex and rape. The maximum punishment for adultery is stoning to death for married people and 100 lashes for the unwed.\\n\\nFor a rape trial to go ahead in Pakistan, four adult Muslim men, 'all of a pious and trustworthy nature', must have witnessed the attack and be willing to testify. Evidence from female and non-Muslim witnesses is considered worthless. A woman who can't produce those witnesses can be prosecuted for fornication and alleging a false crime, the penalties for which are stoning, lashings or prison.\\n\\nLast week, despite claims by President General Pervez Musharraf that he was willing to reform the way rape is handled, as part of his much-trumpeted 'enlightened moderation', hardliners in the Pakistani parliament refused to sanction the introduction of a bill that would have ended the archaic laws. The vetoed legislation, the Women Protection Bill, proposed to transfer rape and adultery cases from the Islamic legal system to Pakistan's British-influenced secular penal code. The bill would have scrapped the most controversial element of the law, the need for four male witnesses. Women's rights campaigners, who marched in their thousands in Islamabad last week, claim that up to 80 per cent of women in Pakistan's jails face charges related to the Hudood ordinances and accuse the international community of ignoring the issue.\\n\\nYesterday Pakistan's government announced it would now ask a parliamentary committee to review the repeatedly delayed bill.\\n\\nLawyers who handle such cases say the legislation is mainly used as a means of revenge by parents whose daughters have refused arranged marriages, or by husbands in divorce cases. In conservative rural areas, where family honour is paramount, many parents file charges against children who defy tradition to choose their own partners.\\n\\n'Violence against women is a universal problem,' said Kamila Hyat of the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. 'Many governments have taken serious steps to deal with it, Pakistan hasn't. There are thousands of victims of rape and few of them have come close to getting justice; many have been punished for their plight. Simply bringing a rape case to court is widely considered in itself a confession of unlawful sexual intercourse outside marriage.'\\n\\nBut defenders of Hudood claim it is more of a deterrent than anything else, and the penalties are rarely invoked. 'We don't think Hudood laws are against human rights,' said Dr Mirajul Huda, from Jamaat-e-Islami, the biggest group in the six-party Islamist alliance that forced the legislative climbdown. 'They prevent people going to the limits. They put an obstacle on all types of obscenity and protect society.'\\n\\nFor Musharraf, who has survived several assassination attempts since his 1999 military coup and has repeatedly angered Muslim clerics by allying himself with the US, the climbdown is seen as an attempt to placate hardliners. But it plays to fears of what some commentators call a 'creeping Talibanisation' across Pakistan. His supporters claim that Musharraf, who heads a fragile coalition, has taken some action. Several months ago he issued a decree making 1,300 women awaiting trial on Hudood violations eligible for bail, but The Observer has discovered that fewer than 400 of those have been released.\\n\\n'The ordinance is like a sword hanging over the heads of all the women of Pakistan,' said Dr Rubina Saigol, director of Actionaid Pakistan, which gives shelter and legal support to victims of violence. 'It is tragic that the government has reneged on the reforms. Women's rights are not negotiable.'\\n\\nFor Sharma Zia, another victim in the safe house, it is unlikely the fear of being raped again will go away. 'I know I can't stay here for ever,' she says. 'My home town isn't that far away, but I can't return. The men who raped me live close to my parents and even they took the side of my rapists. My allegations only brought them shame. Sometimes I feel like I only bring people shame. I wish I could leave, go abroad, but I know that will never happen.'\",\n",

Seasoned players will not have trouble recalling William Hill. With that in mind, there are numerous reasons to check out the platform.\\n\\nNewcomer Specials\\n\\nLet’s start first with newcomer specials. It’s actually quite common today in the online gambling biz to entice newcomers with exclusive offers so that they sign-up and use their platform. The reason is actually pretty simple–with some massive range of games and platforms, the competition is stiff and sites should better offer newcomers reasons to try the out. William Hill doesn’t disappoint at all in this regard. If you desire to try out tennis betting for example, the same special runs but in this case, you’ll be able to receive £30 worth of betting bonus for every £10 stake you add and after using the code C30. The same special code applies to most games on the platform available for betting. Some exclusions may apply. In soccer betting, for instance, you’ll get only £20 as a free staking bonus for every £10 you stake. Many of the separate games on the site also carry some fabulous offers with them and we suggest that you view them yourself.\\n\\nBonus rules\\n\\nFor the purpose of using the site-wide C30 bonus code, we are now listing all the terms that come with it. You can also view these directly in detail from their main website. So anyone seeking to take advantage of this promo special, will need to place an original deposit of £10 or more.\\n\\nTo proceed enabling the bonus, you’ll need to add funds on an event with odds, single or progressive at a level of odds 1.5 (½) or more. Additionally, this special applies only to new customers that sign-up. If you are an existing William Hill customer, you won’t be able to take advantage of this special. Also, you can’t create another account as as a trick to reap the bonus. Additionally, any users of Skrill, Neteller, Paysafe or Moneybookers are not included for this C30 bonus promotion as stated by their official rules , terms and conditions. Furthermore, the special is only valid for the sportsbook area of stakes and other gaming options like Casino, Poker, and Bingo, are not included. You are free to spend your bonus funds within 30 days after making your first deposit and after this period, your bonus funds will expire.\\n\\nLast but not least, the offer will stay open till Dec 31st 2019 before it expires. The above are the main terms and conditions that govern this bonus special. For full details, we suggest that you check these on the main site.\\n\\nExisting player specials\\n\\nEven though it may seem that only new players are entitled to specials, this isn’t the case as existing players can reap specials and rewards as well. For instance, in case you are horse racing enthusiast, there is a special bonus offer which gives you 15% on top of your winnings worth max. £100. This special though applies to horse stakes you support to win by at least 2 lengths in chosen UK and Irish flat races. In case you stake ay super league events, you are entitled to get your cash returned in the form of a free bet if your initial score bet scores second. Additionally, you can take advantage of the ‘enhanced odds’ special available every day in various areas. Make sure you search for this offer when adding stakes on your chosen sports so you get more with each stake. All greyhound fans out there can view real time streams of greyhound races free of charge.

They also host a dedicated Radio station with all insider info, stakes, stats, and expert commentary for making the best betting choices and maximize your odds to land a big win.\\n\\nFAQS\\n\\nIt’s natural for newcomers on the site to have some questions and as third party reviewers, we had some questions as well. Perhaps the No 1 question users have is about the legitimacy of the platform. With so many online scams out there, it’s natural to feel suspicious of gambling platforms like this. But since William Hill has been a big and trusty name in the biz, there is nothing to worry about. The platform is fully licensed and maintains strong security measures that preserve the safety of the users. Users can add and withdraw money safely in just a few seconds so there is no reason to be worried.\\n\\nCasino specials\\n\\nWilliam Hill Casino runs numerous specials for newbies and devoted customers. Here are the most important ones:\\n\\n£10 min. Deposit bonus\\n\\nUK users are given the chance to test the platform out without making a deposit. All they have to do is to use the £10 special to unlock the bonus. The bonus funds will stay active for the next 72 hours after claim.

The lowest amount you can add is £10 and you must rollover the amount 35X before you can withdraw your earnings. As with the previous bonus, slots and scratch off tickets count totally towards rollover requirements and bets or other games count anywhere from 0-25%.\\n\\nYou can reveal the Vegas Promo code in the above table section.\\n\\n£200 welcome special\\n\\nWill Hill Casino entices newbies to sign in and download the respective app with a generous bonus. The bonus yields 150% on top of added funds and covers amounts of max. £200. All you have to do is download the app on your P.C or device and head to the Cashier section.

Slot games and strachoff tickets add up 100% towards rollover requirements. Other gaming options count lower and up to 35% towards rollover requirements. Keep in mind that the bonus will stay enabled for the next 7 days so use it while you can.\\n\\nThis current special is open for both newcomers and existing clients as opposed to the previous welcome code.\\n\\nWhy we like the Will Hill Casino area\\n\\nHow to get additional points.\\n\\nNow you can collect Comp points (Complimentary points) at Will Hill casino every time you bet with your real cash. The more games and money you stake, the more comp points you are going to grab.\\n\\nEvery £10 you stake is equal to one comp point. There is no limit in the points you can collect, however, different casino games contribute to different amounts of points. For example some games come with double comp points and you better check these out. The exchange rates may change on occasion. This is what actually makes them different from the competition.\\n\\nHow to claim and swap golde chips for real cash stakes\\n\\nAs a newbie at William Hill Casino, you can swap golden chips for real cash stakes to play on other eligible games. Golden chips are available in the casino section of the site once you sign in your account.\\n\\nIt is also possible to reveal all the eligible games with golden chips from the same area. All users that fit given requirements for claiming golden chips will receive important notifications in the bottom section whilst playing their chosen game.\\n\\nThe moment you claim your golden chips is the moment you can start using them as well. However, you can only spare these chips during the start of the game you’ve chosen.\\n\\nGames included in the eligible list are: Live and Premium Roulette Pro versions, Euro Roulette, Baccarat, and French Roulette.\\n\\nKeep in mind that funds used with golden chips are not actually realy cash. You have to rollover your funds 40X at least before you can cash out.\\n\\nWill Hill VIP programs\\n\\nWilliam Hill Players can now get their hands in a hot VIP special every time they tell their friends to join the VIP program. A few of the privileges they can get include specials, bonuses, discounts and higher comp points collected through eligible games.\\n\\nThe VIP program level you are placed depends on how many real cash you spare and how often you use the platform.\\n\\nTherefore, if someone wants to be a part of this reward scheme they have to fulfill all the VIP membership criteria. As soon as the system confirms the eligibility of the client, they will be given an e-mail notification with a link to participate in their reward scheme.\\n\\nIf the player manages to collect a certain number of points, they will be upgraded to a higher level with more privileges.\\n\\nThe exchange amounts for comp points vary according to your VIP membership level. For example, if you are a bronze VIP member, the exchange rate is 95 comp points for 1 dollar or pound. For Silver level members the amount is 30 comp points per 1 dollar or pound and lastly for platinum gold members, the exchange rate is set to 80 points per 1 dollar or pound.\\n\\nEvery time the players uses golden chips they also get a bonus. You will know as soon you get these golden chips specials and use them progressively when opting to play a game.\\n\\nHere is a nice and clear example that shows how golden chip staking works: Let’s say that the user signs-in to their casino account. As soon as they head to the mobile area of their account, they can see a list of all eligible games they can use with their golden chip bonus. The client uses these towards the start of each game and they grab £30. Since the rollover requirement is 40X, the player must spare £1200 in total to cash out.\\n\\nReferral specials\\n\\nIn case you are an existing player and you invite a friend to join, you can get max. £50 in the form of bonuses. Your friend though must sign in and add their first deposit on their account’s wallet to get your bonus.\\n\\nThere is no actual limit to the number of friends you can invite, unlike other similar programs. As long as the other person you invite opens an account and add their first deposit on the casino, you can redeem the £50 bonus.\\n\\nFor those that wish to join the referral program, one of the main requirements is to install the software app supplied by the casino for referrals and the referral link that invites your friend to join.\\n\\nThe friend that wishes to join should follow carefully all the required steps revealed to them by e-mail.\\n\\nTo fully redeem the bonus, your joining friend should add a minimum of £50 and stake another £50 at least.\\n\\nAfter redeeming the bonus, you should rollover this 15X to be able to make a withdrawal.\\n\\nHere is a good example: John is an existing player at William Hill. Once he gets the required referral link, he forwards it to his friend Jack-Jack uses the link and implements all the required steps given to him by e-mail starting from opening his own account. He then goes ahead and add his first cash deposit of £20. He chooses a game and uses his funds. John and Jack will now get a £20 on their accounts as a bonus. For cashing out their profits, they have to separately rollover X15 their bonus funds which is (£300). You don’t have to use any other promo code once you have been referred by a friend. See this video powered by William Hill Casino to see the bonus and casino areas in action.\\n\\nOther promotional codes and welcome specials\\n\\nApart from the official William Hill casino lobby, new players can reap other extra bonus in other game sections like Bingo and Poker, for example:\\n\\nThe existing promo is 400% bonus on top for amounts max. £40 for newcomer bingo players. The bonus is split like that: £30 is granted as Bingo Bonus and £10 as bonus amount for games.\\n\\nPoker games.Enter the code WHP2000 to land a £10 free to play.\\n\\nOur verdict\\n\\nQuality-wise the platform has nothing to envy from other big players in the biz and William Hill is renowned for its quality platform. Numerous gaming options are available at a player’s fingertips like for example football, tennis, cricket, basketball, and others.\\n\\nAnd the best part, a no-fuss gaming experience is guaranteed. It literally just takes a few minutes to sign-up and start gambling.\\n\\nFunctionality of games & bets\\n\\nThe site has one of the top betting functionality system you can find out there (also known as ergonomics). This refers to the level of system responsiveness to player needs and where the player wishes to head to. The system is smart and interactive and the level of platform is on pretty high standards. But that doesn’t come across as a surprise. Will Hill is definitely one of the top names in the online betting era with millions of profits and fans out there–imagine if all this was translated into a faulty and dysfunctional design system that just look amateurish. Overall, we are talking about a solid platform that really pays attention to user experience and stats.\\n\\nNow going back to the topic of odds, the levels are pretty much similar to what you’ll experience in most other websites. But, if you take advantage of their special promos, you can maximize the value of your funds for bigger wins. These specials run almost every day so stay tuned and keep your eyes open for new and more exciting specials that fit your gaming type and category.\\n\\nTheir customer support team is also excellent but as we have stated numerous times before, this is what you get when you are dealing with the top 5 names on the biz. The platforms offers a 24-hour customer support service and real agents are ready to cater to your queries and issues when you need them. The average response time is pretty prompt so you can rest assured that your query will be handled as quickly as possible. Now, that’s not to say that everyone is satisfied with their customer service–just like almost any company, there are a few complaints that the customer service is not that helpful. But that’s only a small minority as most users of the platform agree that their customer service is great overall.\\n\\nFunding methods-adding funds and withdrawals\\n\\nThe wide availability of banking options is another reason to use the site with no worries. There are actually more than 6 different funding options to add and withdraw your earnings.These include of course common credit cards like Visa and Mastercard, Maestro, Paypal, Neteller, Skrill, Nordea and others. You can simply add funds instantly in a few seconds if you choose a digital payment method. However, less direct and conventional methods like for example bank wires may require anywhere from 2-10 days prior cashing out. The highest amount you can add with a single transaction is $100K via a bank check.You can also add a max of $99.999 via common funding options like Visa/Visa Electron, Maestro, and Mastercard. For Paypal transactions, the highest amount you can bet per transaction is $5K. The good thing is, no matter what funding option you use, there are no transaction fees like on other websites.\\n\\nCustomer service info\\n\\nShould you wish to reach them out for any query or issue with your account or the platform in general, you can hit their free UK landline: 0800 085 6295 or their global free line at: 00800 3551 355 and your query will be handled as promptly as possible. If you wish to reach them out via another method besides the phone, you can also do so through e-mail at [email protected] You may not get an instant response but your query will be addressed fast enough.\\n\\nMobile site & app\\n\\nBesides the main version available for P.C users, the platform also has a dedicated Android and mobile app. Therefore, mobile and android users won’t struggle to use the platform. On top of that, Android users also have access to special bonuses just for them. The basic features that appear on the main version are also available on mobile. You can use the platform with ease, nothing will appear weird. Mobile users can also take advantage of their exclusive horse racing special. The only steps that you have to do, of course, is to download and save the app on your smartphone or android. It takes only a few minutes and it’s really worth your time as things will get easier afterwards.\\n\\nFinal Verdict\\n\\nIf you ask us, we believe that William Hill really lives up to its robust name in the biz of gambling. With so many competitors, things can get hard but Will Hill still manages to stay among the top. And if there is something that you aren’t keen on at this platform, there are a few similar alternatives to bet on. But since their sportsbook betting products and bets are excellent, they really make a good choice for sports gamblers.\\n\\nWilliam Hill is a brand that’s truly made themselves climb among the top in the biz. Their non-stop dedication and devotion to offering their users a top-notch gaming experience makes them one of the highest ranking betting platforms you can find out there–covering both sports enthusiasts and casino fans.\\n\\nTop 3 competing sites\\n\\nAs there are a few other sites with very similar design and betting products, it would be noteworthy to mention what its 3 top main competitors are. The no1 is probably Bet365, which is another big player (if not the biggest) in the betting biz. One thing that makes Bet365 a step ahead of others and William Hill, in this case, is its smart, simple, and hassle-free layout offering a really great user experience.\\n\\nAnother good alternative site is Ladbrokes. We particularly like that they offer a welcome special for £20 if you stake just £5 in the form of free stakes. Due to its quality and simple layout, you’ll find this a tad easier to use comparing to the William Hill website. The level of stakes ranks similar to the ones you can find on William Hill. Overall, using the Ladbroke platform is a breeze.We also like how easy it is to add funds and cash out as you wish.\\n\\nLast but not least, another option you can try out that’s on par with the previously mentioned betting platforms is Betfred. Betfred is a very popular name in the UK gambling biz and even globally, over the last few years. They currently run a special for welcoming new users: a £30 extra for an original deposit of £10.You can take advantage of all their special bonuses after opening new accounts and adding your first funds without any restrictions. Plus, they boast one of the best stakes in the online betting market and so we suggest that you chew them out.\\n\\nSee also: Netbet\\n\\nList of William Hill apps\\n\\nAll big gambling operators out there offer mobile versions of their products.

If you’re ok with that, go for the apps.\\n\\nTop 3 alternatives to the WH App\\n\\nIf you don’t want to play at William Hill, here are three alternatives we consider to be among the places for gambling online:\\n\\nTopbet– a complete portfolio\\n\\nTopbet is another gambling giant that has been around for ages. The company has its own online platform for gambling. It offers sports betting, casino, live casino, poker, bingo, and other interesting products. The quality of each is high both on desktop and mobile. Another advantage of Topbet are the many promotions that provide value to both new and existing customers.\\n\\nBet365 – the biggest bookie out there\\n\\nBet365 is the most popular online bookmaker across the globe. The sportsbook offers one of the largest betting coupons, arguably the best live betting console out there, and exceptional odds. All of them and other popular features are available on mobile too.\\n\\nThe operator is not only about the sportsbook. Bet365 also offers one of the best casinos out there, with hundreds of games by renowned developers like Microgaming, NetEnt, Playtech, and others. You could also enjoy poker, bingo, and other gambling platforms.\\n\\nUnibet – quality platforms on desktop and mobile\\n\\nYou certainly heard the name Unibet and for a reason. The company has developed one of the best gambling platforms out there. It offers sports betting, tons of casino games, poker, bingo, and much more. Each of them is available on the go as well, both through native apps and mobile-responsive pages.\\n\\nOther reasons to pick Unibet include the fast payments, plenty of promotions for all players, polite support, and flawless reputation. The poker room deserves a special mention too, as you will find one of the softest fields online.\\n\\nValidity period of the William Hill Promo Code: 2019',\n",

The company’s focus on becoming more of a search and discovery platform may have contributed to retaining these new users while encouraging them to log in month after month.\\n\\nAs Pinterest evolves, its user base has grown along with it. Further expansion plans include introducing “app pins”, which will somehow allow people to download apps from Pins without the need for Apple’s App Store.

       " 'Income inequality is mounting in Canada, making an already inexcusable wealth gulf worse.\\n\\nAnd with wealth comes privilege — especially in Canadian banking.\\n\\nLow-income residents of Canada face a significant double standard when it comes to accessing banking services despite urgently wanting them, according to a survey of 268 ACORN Canada members, whose findings were published today by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives’ Ontario office.\\n\\nThe survey results show many have been denied access to very basic banking services — such as cheque cashing or overdraft protection — from traditional banks.\\n\\nBut everyone has to eat. And sleep. So when the banks refuse to offer a bridge over roaring financial water, many low-income people turn to payday lenders to ferry them across. But the toll is steep: astronomical interest rates, some as high as 500 per cent await them on the other side.\\n\\nHalf of the surveyed ACORN members turned to predatory lending storefronts to cash a cheque. One in three went for food money. Another 17 per cent needed cash to pay the rent.\\n\\nWho are these low-income residents of Canada turning to modern day loan sharks? They’re people you may see every day. Some of them, indeed some of the most vulnerable people in Canadian society, receive fixed incomes such as social assistance, disability payment and/or pensions. Others work — 18.7 per cent of them hold full-time employment and 13.6 per cent toil part-time — and still don’t impress Bay Street enough for the bankers to offer them service.\\n\\nACORN’s members say they need credit cards. They say they need chequing and savings accounts. They say they need overdraft protection. Almost half (47.7 per cent) of the survey respondents reported trying to get a line of credit. More than 42 per cent tried to secure a no-fee account.\\n\\nWhen rejected by Bay Street, low-income people have little choice but to turn to predatory loan operators. There are about 1,500 payday storefronts in Canada. More than half of them are in Ontario.\\n\\nThe thing is, it’s not as if this is the favoured option for anywhere close to most people with low incomes. Less than five per cent of ACORN’s respondents told the organization they preferred high-interest banking services. More than 60 per cent of respondents told ACORN they believe it is “very important” for banks to offer overdraft protection, small loans, no fee accounts, and lines of credit to low- and moderate-income earners. If such services were offered by a bank or credit union, close to 75 per cent of respondents told ACORN they would switch where they do their banking.\\n\\nBut they can’t. And so, those who sweat and bleed for meagre pay or who are unable to make ends meet are cast off by the Canadian banking industry.\\n\\nAll of this, in an advanced capitalist nation where the average adjusted for inflation income of the top 100 Canadian CEOs has spiked by 89 per cent since 1998, while the average Canadian income has increased by a mere eight per cent.\\n\\nHow much trouble are corporate executives having getting approved for credit when needed? It seems to come down to this: it takes money to get money.\\n\\nWhat does it all mean? Firstly, that so many low-income residents, be they receiving a fixed income or working, are unable to make ends meet is an indicator that neither government nor the labour market is adequately compensating people for basic necessities. Secondly, the banks are clearly failing some of this country’s most vulnerable people. These tensions strike at the integrity of the Canadian economy and have deep social implications.\\n\\nIn response to this banking sector double standard, ACORN wants to see the federal government legislate the banks to provide fair access to low-income families; specifically that they should have access to:\\n\\nlow-interest credit for emergencies\\n\\nlow-interest overdraft protection\\n\\nno-holds on cheques\\n\\nan NSF fee of $10 instead of $45\\n\\nalternatives to payday lenders such as postal banking and credit union\\n\\nACORN also wants to see Ottawa implement an anti-predatory lending strategy, a tracking database to halt the rolling over of loans from one company to another, and the lowering of the Criminal Code maximum interest rate on loans to 30 per cent from 60.\\n\\nUltimately, this leaves Canada at a fork in the river. Policymakers at both the federal and provincial levels can either move on options to overhaul the banking system so that all residents of Canada get the banking services they deserve, or continue to permit a borrowing double standard that burdens low-income people with a vicious cycle of high-interest debt.\\n\\nJoe Fantauzzi is a Masters candidate in Ryerson University’s Department of Public Policy. He is an intern and research assistant at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives’ Ontario office. Joe is a former newspaper journalist.',\n",

Dragon\\'s success shows that commercial spaceships have the right stuff, and it should pave the way for many more of them to get off the ground in the future, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s a great day for the country and for the world,\" Musk said in a post-docking press conference Friday. \"This really is, I think, going to be recognized as a significantly historical step forward in space travel, and hopefully the first of many to come.\"\\n\\nA big day for NASA, too\\n\\nNASA officials were thrilled with the day\\'s events as well. The space agency is counting on private craft like Dragon to carry cargo, and eventually crew, to the station in the wake of the space shuttle\\'s retirement last year. [SpaceX\\'s Dragon Arrives at Space Station (Pictures)]\\n\\n\"It was an effort that will revolutionize the way we carry out space exploration, with the private sector taking over responsibility for transportation to the ISS,\" NASA chief Charlie Bolden said in a congratulatory call to the space station crew today. \"This will free NASA up to focus on the really hard stuff, like sending our astronauts to an asteroid and, eventually, on to Mars.\"\\n\\nSpaceX holds a $1.6 billion NASA contract to make 12 robotic supply runs to the orbiting lab with Dragon and its Falcon 9 rocket, and the capsule\\'s performance on its current demonstration mission is making that look like a good investment.\\n\\nAs long as Dragon is able to make its way back to Earth safely, the first of those 12 bona fide cargo missions will likely blast off this September, NASA officials said. (The capsule is slated to depart the station on May 31 and splash down in the Pacific Ocean off California, where it will be recovered by SpaceX personnel.)\\n\\n\"This truly is the beginning of a new era in commercial spaceflight,\" said Alan Lindenmoyer, manager of NASA\\'s Commercial Crew and Cargo Program.\\n\\nThough today\\'s press conference was held in Houston, Musk and Lindenmoyer joined in from SpaceX\\'s headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif. Their words were often drowned out by the cheers of ecstatic SpaceX personnel celebrating the successful orbital meet-up between Dragon and the $100 billion space station.\\n\\nSpaceX\\'s big dreams\\n\\nMusk founded SpaceX in 2002 with one primary goal in mind — to help humanity settle worlds beyond Earth. And today\\'s docking brings that ambitious aim a little closer to reality, he said.\\n\\n\"I\\'m really excited, because this was a crucial step,\" Musk said. \"It makes the things in the future — and the ultimate path toward humanity becoming a multiplanet species — much, much more likely. The chances of that happening just went up dramatically, so people should be really excited about that.\"\\n\\nBefore we can think seriously about colonizing other worlds, Musk has said, the cost of spaceflight needs to come down considerably. Toward this end, SpaceX is working to develop a fully reusable rocket, in contrast with the expendable launch vehicles in widespread use today.\\n\\n\"The cost of the fuel is only about 0.3 percent of the cost of the mission,\" Musk said. \"So if rockets can be made reusable, then it\\'s possible to reduce the cost of spaceflight maybe by a factor of 100 or more.\"\\n\\nSpaceX is also upgrading Dragon to carry crew, and it hopes to be flying astronauts to the space station within the next three years or so. Manned flights to destinations beyond low-Earth orbit, such as Mars, may come into the company\\'s sights after that.\\n\\nYou can follow SPACE.com senior writer Mike Wall on Twitter: @michaeldwall.

       " \"“I’ve read about revolutions. If you ignore the lower class long enough they’ll rise up”\\n\\nAmazon Jobs Day applicants speak out\\n\\nBy our reporters\\n\\n3 August 2017\\n\\nAs Wall Street celebrated a record high yesterday and the rich saw their money stack even higher, tens of thousands of people in need of a job lined up at Amazon Jobs Day fair sites across the United States. Lauded as one of the largest hiring events in US history, Amazon is projected to hire on some 50,000 people to its workforce.\\n\\nA line of job seekers at Amazon’s job fair location in New Jersey\\n\\nThe workers who lined up constituted a cross-section of the working class, young and old, black and white, native-born and immigrant. Their comments and views reflected the impact of the social crisis in the United States—the lack of full-time work and medical coverage, stagnating wages, the growth of poverty, student loan debt and other social problems. There were also expressions of growing radicalization, which has been generated by immense levels of inequality, endless wars and a corporate-controlled political system, which is oblivious to the concerns of working-class people.\\n\\nFor those hired, grueling working conditions and a yearly net pay of $15,000 to $25,000 per year awaits them. As one Kenosha, Wisconsin Amazon worker put it, “A lot of people like myself are very frustrated with working here. Management is trying to hide the truth from the applicants. But they’ll see soon enough once they start.” She added management had covered up employee communications boards where workers had written down suggestions and complaints for applicants touring the facility.\\n\\nApplicants in Illinois, Wisconsin, New Jersey, New York and Ohio spoke with reporters from the World Socialist Web Site and International Amazon Workers Voice. Over the next several days the WSWS will post additional comments from workers at these and other locations.\\n\\nKenosha, Wisconsin\\n\\nAustin\\n\\nAustin, who grew up in the Kenosha, Wisconsin area, just south of Milwaukee, told reporters the area declined dramatically after the Chrysler auto factory closed in the 1980s. Unlike at Amazon, the jobs there paid relatively well and provided good benefits. He said, “The fact that Amazon is constantly having job fairs in the area and pretty much all across the country isn’t very reassuring. It means they have a high turn-around. People are coming and leaving.”\\n\\nRomeoville, Illinois\\n\\nJoe\\n\\nJoe, a 22-year-old, came looking for a full-time job with benefits. When asked why he was at the job fair, he said, “Trying to get out of my parents’ house.” He was laid off from a call center a few weeks ago and worked in warehouses before that.\\n\\nReporters met friends Tahaj and Angel. “We just graduated high school and are looking to start our careers,” said Angel. “A lot of our friends are working part-time jobs, sometimes two or three. We’d really like to get something full time. There’s been a lot of cuts at the schools. We’ve got 20-30 kids in each class and it’s all about memorizing for the standardized tests.” Tahaj, her friend, said, “In the election I liked Sanders the best but I don’t really trust him. People only looked to Hillary as a last resort.”\\n\\nEric, from Peoria, Illinois, said he was at the job fair “looking to get a better job,” preferably full-time with benefits. He currently works full-time as a cook. When asked about Caterpillar moving its headquarters from Peoria, he said people were “not too happy about that” and couldn’t find jobs. “I watched a lot of people lose a lot of stuff, people who worked at Caterpillar. Houses, cars, families broke up over it.” When asked about the political situation and the 2016 election, he simply said, “I think it’s a mess.”\\n\\nDylan, who is about to be a father, recently moved from Charleston, Illinois, a small town hit hard by the opioid epidemic. He said there are very few jobs in Charleston. Dylan worked in the food industry, which has a cap of about $11 per hour, and is currently working as a roofer part-time without any benefits. “Something’s got to give.” He currently gets health care from the state, which covers minor expenses, but is worried about what would happen in a health emergency: “I’m sure if I had some kind of heart problem, I’d be screwed.” When asked about the election, he said, “It was a lose-lose.” “Which snake do you want in the office?” He added, “I’m hoping the guy [Trump] doesn’t serve his full term.”\\n\\nChristian\\n\\nChristian told reporters, “I’ve had the same job since I was 16. It’s part-time and after six years I really want something better. No one my age has good work. It’s either full-time at minimum wage or piecing together part-time jobs. I heard Amazon has full-time positions with good benefits and that’s why I came. Out of anyone in the election I would have voted for Bernie Sanders. Our current administration is just putting a lot of money in politicians’ pockets. They’re representing wealthy corporations and not the people. I’ve read a lot about revolutions and if you ignore the lower class long enough they’ll rise up. If this situation keeps going there will be a revolution.\\n\\n“We’re a country that was founded on a revolution. It’s been almost 250 years with the same constitution and that’s a good run but things have changed. I think the system that constitution made is good but the people running it are corrupt. A lot of people look at immigration the wrong way. We all descend from immigrants at some point. It’s a very scared way of thinking to just try and kick people out. It doesn’t matter what your skin color is or where you’re from.”\\n\\nEtna, Ohio\\n\\nCharman and Elijah\\n\\nCharman, another applicant, told reporters, “I don’t think this is the best time to be alive especially with my situation. I’m an immigrant from the Dominican Republic. It’s not an easy step up, me and my family are starting from nothing trying to go somewhere, hopefully university. If I fail it goes to the next person to try and help.”\\n\\nAnother applicant, Malik, came looking for full-time work with benefits, and was called in for the job fair. He was a seasonal temporary worker for Amazon for a month around Christmas. As a temp, he had no benefits and made less than $11 an hour. When asked how much the temp agency took from his work, he said he didn’t know. “That’s why I wasn’t too mad about not working for them.” When he was a temp, he worked eight-hour shifts with mandatory overtime. He’s applying for a job with ten-hour shifts.\\n\\nTina, who works at a Bob Evans restaurant, said that life for workers is really different from when she was younger. “Poverty today is horrible,” she said. “I didn’t grow up with a silver spoon in my mouth but today it’s just awful. Jeff Bezos’s pay ($23,000 per minute) irritates me. I make $4.08 an hour and that’s not enough. It’s not like it was in my day. It’s a lot less safe, there are less jobs now, and you used to be able to get a job with regular paychecks and benefits. Today I’ve worked jobs that have withheld six weeks of pay and I’m wondering where my money is!”\\n\\nDweekan\\n\\nRobbinsville, New Jersey\\n\\nDweekan said, “I used to work at Amazon, and it was good. But then they kept switching managers and it was hard to keep track of the rules. I was an ambassador, but the new managers took away that title. Then I wound up getting hurt at work. I went to the medical center and they sent me to some doctors, but then human resources told me I lost my job because I had already used up all my sick days. They didn’t pay the bills or pay me for medical leave like they were supposed to.”\\n\\nMarty\\n\\nBuffalo, New York\\n\\nMarty, a former warehouse worker with 28 years of experience, said of the employment situation in Buffalo, “Jobs are bad here and it’s definitely tough for older workers to find jobs. They were essentially offering only part-time work with no benefits and the chance to maybe advance. He also said, “I’m not here to get rich. I just want a decent job.

Photo by Thea Alberto-Masakayan, ABS-CBN News\\n\\nMANILA - Fewer Filipinos are getting married, the latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed.\\n\\n\"In a span of 10 years, the reported marriages decreased by 20.1 percent from 2005 to 2015,\" according to the recently released report.\\n\\nPSA said that according to data on marriages, mostly obtained from the Certificates of Marriage at Civil Registrars throughout the country, there has been a \"continuous decline\" in marriages. It however did not cite reasons for the decreasing numbers.\\n\\n\"It is interesting to note that from that year up to 2015, the number of marriages declined continuously.

At least 42 percent of couples tied the knot via civil wedding, while 36 percent said their \"I do\\'s\" during Roman Catholic ceremonies.\\n\\nPSA said that of the 1,135 weddings happening everyday in 2015, 14 percent are held in the National Capital Region, 13 percent in Calabarzon, and 11 percent in Central Luzon.\\n\\n\"These regions were consistently in the top three for the past five years in the same order,\" the report said.',\n",
       " 'PROVO — The ceremony for seniors that annually precedes BYU\\'s final home football game should have an exception this year.\\n\\nAs a fifth-year senior, Taysom Hill would still have one year of eligibility left for next season if he chooses to return. If the often-injured quarterback, who has been sidelined since the first game, declines the opportunity to keep playing then this year would be his last as a college football player.\\n\\nEither way, BYU should proceed as if Hill\\'s time in the program has ended. When Hill\\'s name is announced and he receives his senior blanket, the home crowd should extend a rousing applause as part of a thank you and goodbye.\\n\\nAs harsh as it sounds, BYU football needs to move on from Hill. The reality is, Tanner Mangum is BYU\\'s quarterback of the present and the future.\\n\\n\"The best-case scenario for Taysom is we might award two (senior blankets),\" coach Bronco Mendenhall said this week. \"When in doubt we\\'ll award extras. If we\\'re not sure what someone is going to do we\\'ll give them one, and if they want to come back they don\\'t have to give it back and we\\'ll give them another.\"\\n\\nNot scheduled to talk the future with Hill until after the season, Mendenhall can\\'t say what the future holds for the quarterback. Here\\'s where Mendenhall needs to make the tough decision in the program\\'s best interests, like he did the last two times in recent years in firing several coaches on the offensive staff.\\n\\nRelated:\\n\\nMangum or Hill in 2016? If Taysom Hill decides to play football for BYU in 2016 who should start: Hill or Tanner Mangum? Here are arguments for each quarterback.\\n\\nA wildly talented player, Hill has not been able to stay healthy in three of the last four seasons. After suffering a season-ending injury in the fifth game last season Hill went down in the opener this year. He also lost his freshman year to an injury in midseason.\\n\\nTo count on anything from Hill next season would be foolish and also irresponsible to the rest of the team. The time to part ways is now, allowing Hill enough time to seek opportunities elsewhere if he wants.\\n\\n\"He\\'s going to want to play quarterback, and I\\'m not certain that\\'s the right thing for BYU, quite frankly, at this moment,\" said former BYU offensive coordinator Brandon Doman, who was fired two years ago.\\n\\n\"I would recommend for BYU to get Tanner ready to go the next three years and prepare to have a real stable environment at quarterback. He\\'s not going to be suspect to injury like Taysom is because he\\'s not running around.\"\\n\\nWhile playing time always should be earned, Mangum doesn\\'t need to be looking over his shoulder next season. It\\'s best for the team for him to go into the offseason as the designated starting quarterback, with others vying for the back-up position.\\n\\nDistant and recent history also has proven BYU\\'s offense works best with a pass-first quarterback as opposed to a dual-threat. Even with Hill putting up eye-popping statistics at times, BYU was only 8-5 during the season he remained healthy.\\n\\nRiley Nelson, who as a dual-threat in the mode of Hill, also battled injury issues during his time as a starter. BYU averaged almost 11 wins a season during the four years that pass-first quarterbacks John Beck and Max Hall started.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t to suggest Hill should quit even if he wants to keep playing. As a graduate student, he could transfer and be immediately eligible to play next season.\\n\\nOne possibility could be playing for Jim Harbaugh at Michigan, which starts a senior quarterback who transferred in for this season. Hill signed to play for Harbaugh at Stanford but never went there and transferred upon returning from a church mission after the coach left to take over for the San Francisco 49ers.\\n\\n\"I would tell Taysom to do the best thing for Taysom,\" Doman said. \"If Michigan comes knocking and you\\'ve got a fifth opportunity to play quarterback for Jim Harbaugh, and that\\'s the best thing for Taysom Hill then he should go do that for sure.\"\\n\\n×\\n\\nRelated Stories',\n",
       " 'read\\n\\nThe last article walked through the key generation process and all of the traps that will end in an insecure key. Even after that, though, a new key pair doesn\\'t do you any good whatsoever if you can\\'t get it to the people you want to communicate with. As the saying goes, \"encryption is easy; key distribution is hard.\"\\n\\nThere are two main approaches to key distribution: the Certificate Authority model, and the Web of Trust model. Both have slight variations and extensions as they are implemented in the \"real world\", but they boil down to roughly the same fundamentals.\\n\\nCertificate Authorities\\n\\nThe Certificate Authority (or CA) model is the basis for the majority of encryption used on the internet today. From corporate intranets to securing your bank\\'s website, Certificate Authorities is the method of choice for making sure that the key you are using to talk to someone actually belongs to the person you want to reach. SSL/TLS, which secures (essentially) all encrypted HTTP traffic in the world, mandates the use of the CA model.\\n\\nThe Certificate Authority model is very simple. Baked into your web browsers and your operating systems is a list of companies which you trust to validate identities on the internet, and so-called \"root certificates\" for those authorities. You might be surprised to know just how many of them there are, and with names that you probably have never even heard of. At the time of this writing, there are 180 root certificates that are distributed by the Mozilla Foundation with their Firefox browser, and other browsers and operating systems will have similarly large counts, though some of the specifics may vary slightly.\\n\\nThe complete list has many names that are recognizable - the governments of France, Japan, Spain, Taiwan, The Netherlands, and Turkey, for instance - as well as many names that aren\\'t nearly so familiar. Did you know that companies like Atos, Buypass, Camerfirma, Izenpe, and WISeKey can all sign certificates that will be instantly trusted by your computer? This is not to say that any of these companies is necessarily untrustworthy - but it also points out the fundamental flaw of Certificate Authorities: you need to have at least one agency that you trust, fundamentally, to authorize all the others. - and you need it at the very beginning.\\n\\nIf it\\'s not included in your browser, or in your operating system, you have no way of determining if any list of certificate authorities that you retrieve in the future is authentic. These CAs, well-meaning as they may be, are a target for attack. Hackers have compromised them in the past, issuing fake certificates which were used to impersonate Google, among other things. It is commonly believed that the United States Government stole certificates for use in distributing targeted malware to disrupt the Iranian nuclear program. CAs have also made mistakes, issuing certificates with more authority than they were intended to have. These CAs are large targets precisely because of the pedestal on which we put them.\\n\\nSlimming down the list of CAs is certainly a good idea in theory, but in practice it is very difficult. All the certificates issued by those CAs -- and all the certificates issued by their delegates -- need to be reissued. Nor does it answer the solve the harder question: how do we choose who to trust?\\n\\nWeb of Trust\\n\\nMany people would draw a parallel between the web of trust and communism: great in theory, but terrible in practice. The web of trust takes a decidedly more personal approach to solving the problem of key distribution - or, as today\\'s Silicon Valley VC-hotbed would say if it was reinvented today, \"a social network for key distribution.\"\\n\\nWhereas every person who uses a particular version of an operating system or browser works from the same, universal set of CAs, no two people have the same view of the web of trust, even if they have an overlapping layout.\\n\\nThe web of trust, most commonly known as the PGP web of trust, is built on the concept of \"nearness\". Each person starts out trusting no one but themselves, and their own keys. Through a process of in-person verification of stranger\\'s keys, potentially at a ceremony the like of which would once have resulted in a burning at the stake due to the cryptic incantations, the goal is to establish a link of verified keys and trusted parties between you and anyone you would want to communicate with. The hope is, with enough people that you have a trust relationship with, you can reach anyone that you might want to talk to through a minimum of hops.\\n\\nIf you have read that paragraph a couple of times and still have no idea what the fuck it means, have no fear: that\\'s a quite common for first exposure to the web of trust. Unlike the Certificate Authority heirarchical architecture, the web of trust is a distributed mesh of relationships, and it is far from simple.\\n\\nThere are two fundamental operations in the web of trust: verifying (or attesting to) a key and assigning trust to an identity. Let\\'s start with the more common one - verifying a key.\\n\\nKey Signing\\n\\nYou and a friend (named Alice, by convention) have both managed to generate a secure key and you now want to be able to communicate securely. Key exchange is relatively simple if you can meet in person - but how can you leverage people who you meet in person to talk to people that you can\\'t?\\n\\nYou and Alice meet in person and exchange a copy of each other\\'s public keys. This can be done by giving each other a USB stick with the copy of the public key on it, or more commonly, giving each other a piece of paper with a relatively short \"fingerprint\" of the key that you can use to retrieve the key from a server while trusting that it hasn\\'t been altered. If you don\\'t know Alice that well, you might also examine a few copies of her identification, to ensure she really is the person she says she is.\\n\\nWhen you go home that night, you \"sign\" a particularly formed statement that PGP compatible systems know how to read which states that you believe that Alice\\'s key, with the fingerprint that you received from her earlier, actually belongs to her. You then send this attestation to Alice for her to distribute publically. Once she does so, anyone who retrieves a copy of her key will also receive your attestation.\\n\\nLeveraging Trust\\n\\nYou go around to all of your other friends and exchange keys with each other. At the end of the day, you build up a nice network of people that you have signed keys from. How does this help you?\\n\\nWhile you have signed a bunch of different people\\'s keys, you still don\\'t have a mechanism to reach anyone whose keys that you haven\\'t met yourself. However, there\\'s a simple thing you can do to extend your network. As well as attesting to one of your friend\\'s keys, you can also tell your PGP system that you trust this particular friend to verify identities on your behalf. You can even publish this statement of trust publicly. When you do so, other people who trust you can leverage your verifications to reach people that you have met and they haven\\'t, and vice-versa.\\n\\nGreat! Everyone publishes their trusts, everyone publishes their verifications, and we can reach everyone that we want to. This is great! No single point of failure to compromise, leveraging real-world relationships. How social! How Web 2.0!\\n\\nGetting Stuck in the Web\\n\\nSo, that\\'s it. The web of trust is great. Problem solved. Right? ... Right?\\n\\nNot quite. The largest network of PGP servers, SKS Keyservers, has around four million keys in its database [1]. Of those four million, the largest group of keys for which there is a validation path to every other key in that group is less than 60,000 [2]. That means, only 1.5% of keys on the key server can actually be validated through the largest web of trust (called the \"strong set\"). All of the other 98.5% of keys are disconnected - either signed by no one, or signed by a small group of people that has no connection to the larger group.\\n\\nThis problem is called the \"small world\" problem, and it is the giant hole in the web of trust. The web of trust depends on a large interconnected graph, with published trust levels, in order to \"walk\" the path to the key of someone you want to talk to. In practice, even if you manage to get into that 1.5% of the strong set, you are probably too \"far away\" on the graph to use it all that effectively.\\n\\nThis is a bit confusing, so let\\'s work through a real-world example. Let\\'s say I want to send an email to Linus. I have a key in the strong set, and so does he, so I should be able to leverage that web of trust to retrieve a key that I can be confident he actually controls, right?\\n\\nWell... sort of. No one that I trust fully to validate keys on my behalf has signed Linus\\' key. People who I trust fully have signed keys that have signed keys that have signed Linus\\' key, but nothing direct. When I ask GPG what the trust level of Linus\\' key is, it tosses up its hands:\\n\\npub 2048R/0x79BE3E4300411886 2011-09-20 Key fingerprint = ABAF 11C6 5A29 70B1 30AB E3C4 79BE 3E43 0041 1886 uid [ unknown] Linus Torvalds <[email protected]> sub 2048R/0x88BCE80F012F54CA 2011-09-20\\n\\nDigging into this further, GPG (by default) uses the following pattern to dictate how trusted a key is:\\n\\nA key is trusted if it has been signed by you, or signed by someone you trust fully; OR A key is trusted if it has been signed by three people who you marginally trust; AND The path between the key and you is 5 steps or shorter.\\n\\nWhat does this mean for me emailing Linus? Well, #1 isn\\'t valid - I haven\\'t signed Linus\\' key, nor has anyone I fully trust signed it. No one that I marginally trust has signed his key.\\n\\nOne technique that is (somewhat controversially) used is the idea of transitive trust. Most frequently, this is stated that trust is transitive at one level less than the parent. That means, if I trust someone fully, and they sign someone\\'s key (let\\'s say, Bob), then I marginally trust Bob to sign keys on my behalf. Trust, in reality, doesn\\'t really work this way - but let\\'s pretend for a moment. Does that help me talk to Linus?\\n\\nIt gets me closer, but not close enough. I have three different paths of length three between Linus and myself. Of those three paths, two of them start with someone who I trust fully, and one of them starts with someone I trust marginally. This means that two of the people who have signed Linus\\' key get assigned the ability to produce marginally trusted signatures, and one has an untrusted signature. Two marginal signatures isn\\'t enough to satisfy rule #2, so the trust level remains unknown, and it\\'s not \"safe\" for me to email Linus and have confidence that the key really belongs to him.\\n\\nNow what?\\n\\nWell, shit. We covered the two most common models for key distribution, and we have a long list of why they both suck. Now what? In the next article, we will cover some of the less common approaches to key distribution and see if any of those look better.',\n",
       " 'Nutrition is a wonderful playground for people who want to manipulate fear. We need food to live, yet can be poisoned by eating the wrong things. Learning from others which foods are safe and which are dangerous was essential to our survival in the days before grocery stores. We are primed to react to scares about food.\\n\\nWe make 200 food-related decisions every day. Food choices are one of the few things we can control as individuals. Believe that the government and big corporations are poisoning you? Just shop a little differently. (Then bond with your friends on facebook about the conspiracies you’ve foiled.)\\n\\nI teach nutrition at a community college, to students who are interested in the subject but have little to no scientific background. I like to think I’m helping them develop their baloney detectors, but there is a lot of, ahem, baloney out there. I even presented some in class: they voted to watch Hungry For Change and I said fine—but we’ll unpack it and, literally, do our homework on the “experts” featured.\\n\\nBecause, as this review clued me in, the film is a bait-and-switch: it draws in the viewer with a lengthy lament on how unhealthy the western diet is, then turns into an infomercial for juicing. One of the experts is introduced as a filmmaker, but oh by the way he sells juice extractors. Another is the Dr. Oz-endorsed author of books about juice-based “cleansing.” (He believes that the problem with “toxins” is that they cause our bodies to produce a spiritual mucus that makes us sluggish.) Not everyone is juice-centric: some are selling other things, like weight-loss meditation CDs.\\n\\nThe movie even gives a specific warning in its first half: beware anybody selling you food that’s supposed to be healthy, because they don’t make money from your health. They make money by making the product attractive enough that you buy it.\\n\\nIronically, this describes the tactics used by the peddlers in Hungry for Change. It’s true of the people behind Mercola and Natural News (both of whom were featured in the movie, and both of whom hard-sell conspiracy theories about food and medicine right next to dubious products like earthing mats.) And it’s true of my favorite purveyor of facebook-borne rumors, the Food Babe.\\n\\nShe sells meal plans and endorses superfood supplements, but positions herself as an “investigator” of the dangers in foods. The tactic, it seems, is to make people feel that the world is so full of dangerous foods that they better pay for her meal plans that specify what she believes is safe to eat.\\n\\nBut behind the unified front (all processed food is dangerous!) lies a tangled web of factoids. Some are clearly not true, like her claims about GMOs (for a good read on which GMO claims are myths and which are real, I highly recommend Grist’s series.) Others are true, but only scary if you don’t think about them too much – like when she makes a big deal about “wood pulp” in your food. When you extract cellulose from anything, wood or otherwise, what you get is not chunks of trees in your food, but simply cellulose itself, better known as one type of dietary fiber, the stuff that veggies and whole grains are full of.\\n\\nMaureen Ogle sent the Food Babe’s list of “shocking” beer ingredients to several actual brewers. MSG? Nope. Fish swim bladders? Sort of, yeah, but they don’t actually make it into the finished beer. Corn syrup? Possibly, but most of it would be food for the yeast, so that means it’s turned into alcohol by the time you drink it.\\n\\nAlcohol, by the way, is an actual toxin.\\n\\nAll this misinformation is a version of the Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt tactic that’s been recognized as a marketing tool in other contexts. It operates on a guilt-by-association model: if bread contains a chemical that’s also used in yoga mats, you claim that yoga mats are in our food. Nevermind that TUMS contain the same chemical used in gravestones; that’s a great example from Joe Schwarcz’s critique of the Food Babe.\\n\\nCountering this misinformation is, I think, an important but overlooked target for public health. Education helps: many of the misconceptions about GMOs can be overcome once you actually understand what genetic modification is—although it’s a tricky subject. I survey my students about GMOs, and most are usually suspicious of it. When I ask what’s wrong with GMOs, they respond with some serious, legitimate concerns: pesticide residues, Monsanto’s control over farmers, environmental effects of fertilizer runoff. The only problem with these concerns? They aren’t really about GMOs. Once they learn what GMOs can and can’t do, and how the other problems in modern agriculture would exist with or without GMOs, they’re better equipped to form opinions that, whether I agree or not, are based on something closer to fact.\\n\\nI’m not often a fan of the deficit model; educating people doesn’t always change their mind. But you can’t spread rumors about Bt toxin in GM corn if you know what Bt toxin is – a bacterial product that has a long history in organic farming and is naturally abundant in soil. (If you boycott GMOs because of it, you have to boycott organic food too.) Ask critics what bothers them about the toxin, and they’ll start talking about RoundUp, a chemical herbicide that’s involved with a completely different GMO crop. (There’s a good explanation of these two GMOs here.)\\n\\nSo how can we baloney-proof people who are honestly trying to find the best information about how to be safe and healthy? I’ll keep teaching and writing about the real science behind what’s in our food, but in the meantime, maybe this message will appeal: when you hear somebody trying to scare you about food, ask what they’re selling. If you distrust Big Ag and Big Pharma, you won’t find any better treatment from Big Juice.',\n",

       " 'The sight is unmistakeable: A number ten shirt gliding downfield, passing defenders like they weren\\'t there, dominating the play with a simple grace you cannot teach. He knows the touch needed to send the ball looping over a defender\\'s head and floating back to earth at just the right time. He knows how to shift his hips, just slightly and at the crucial moment, to send his opponent flying the wrong way. And boy, does he how to score.\\n\\nThe \"he,\" of course, is Pelé—the great one, the King, the International Olympic Committee\\'s Athlete of the Century, and the man more responsible for soccer\\'s ubiquitous appeal than any other human being alive or dead.\\n\\nTo watch the man born Edson Arantes do Nascimento play soccer is a kind of spiritual experience. It is to witness a person that is doing exactly what he was born to do. It is destiny for him to dance his way past four defenders and score; it is destiny for him to win three World Cups, more than anyone who\\'s ever played. There is an innateness to his supremacy. The game flows through him as he outwits and outruns the helpless opponents from Hungary or Sweden or Argentina or America.\\n\\nMastery of the world\\'s most popular game is, amazingly, only one part of Pelé\\'s story. He may have scored 1281 goals in 1363 games, but he is also a statesman in the truest sense of the word, a cultural ambassador for Brazil and the game he loves all over the world. That began in his playing days. One photo in particular, where he embraces the English legend Bobby Moore at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, speaks volumes. Brazil had just beaten England, the world champions four years earlier. The two men, one white and one black, embraced on the field. It was a seismic moment, a moment of unity and sportsmanship and humanity.\\n\\nWith Bobby Moore at the 1970 World Cup. John Varley\\n\\nAll this has earned him a long overdue feature on the silver screen. It\\'s not his first, truthfully, but it is a biopic tracking his improbable rise from a stamp-sized village to national heroism, as a 17-year-old, at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. Pelé: Birth of a Legend premiered at Tribeca Film Festival last month, and opens in theaters today. While it has its shortcomings—it is overly stylized at times, and the sight of Vincent D\\'Onofrio as a Brazilian national team coach, accent and all, is a bit unnerving—the core of a spectacular story is there. It is, after all, the tale of how a young boy who couldn\\'t afford shoes or a ball became the greatest soccer player the world had ever seen.\\n\\nI sat down with Pelé—75 now and charming as ever—just before the film\\'s premiere to discuss the state of world soccer, Lionel Messi, and his life-changing encounter with Henry Kissinger.\\n\\nWhy do you think soccer became the dominant global sport?\\n\\nThe reason the sport has grown so big, I think, is that it\\'s not only for rich people. It\\'s not just for big people—size doesn\\'t exclude people. Everyone can participate. That\\'s why it\\'s become so popular worldwide. You don\\'t need to have any special quality in particular to play.\\n\\nIn the film, the youth team in your village plays best when you take off your shoes and express yourselves on the field. So does your Brazil national team in 1958, when you use ginga [the traditional term for the Brazilian style of play, one rooted in the martial art of capoeira and defined by rhythm and dance as a way of moving with the ball and deceiving an opponent]. Is soccer at its best when players express themselves?\\n\\nI think it depends how you see the game. From my point of view, what\\'s beautiful in the sport is something you don\\'t need to know too much about tactics or anything to see. If you find something beautiful, you don\\'t need to be an expert to know it. It\\'s like ballet.\\n\\nAfter scoring his 1000th goal. Pictorial Parade Getty Images\\n\\nThe film deals a lot with the effort to suppress ginga when you were on the 1958 Brazil team. The coach wanted you to play a more rigid way, like the Europeans were—\\n\\nThe reason it was nicknamed ginga was that normally, when we\\'d play against a European team—now it\\'s changed a bit—but back then, the European teams were very tough and physical. They were big, and defensively solid. Even the English, who invented football, were like that starting out. There were some in Brazil who thought we should make that our football culture.\\n\\nWe would say, \"We want to dance. We want to ginga. Football is not about fighting to the death. You have to play beautifully.\" And so we did, and that\\'s the reason that Brazil created more of a show, more of a ballet, than the European style.\\n\\nIs that battle between freedom and expression versus the formations and rigid tactics still there today for the Brazil team? Are they still trying to find their way in that sense?\\n\\nYes, unfortunately. The style of football—all over the world, not just Brazil, also Europe—has changed, has become more similar. Brazil has a problem keeping the good players in the country. Almost all the best players, as soon as they come up, are taken elsewhere. We don\\'t have the same Brazilian style—the ball control, the same way of playing—like we did in my time.\\n\\nBecause they go to Europe now?\\n\\nYeah. Because now they appear on the scene when they\\'re 15 years old and go to Europe. Another thing that\\'s changed is that in my time, all of the players used to belong to the team. Now, the majority of players, the best ones, belong to the impressarios, not to the team. The agent who has the rights to the player, and he wants to make money. So he wants them to get sold to Europe. Neymar, for example. In the last five years, Neymar is the best player to come out of Brazil. He used to play for my club, Santos. But when he was transferred to Barcelona, Santos got just 20 percent of the fee. 80 percent went to the manager. It\\'s a big change.\\n\\nAt the 1966 World Cup. Art Rickersby Getty Images\\n\\nSpeaking of transfers, you were eventually declared a national treasure by Brazil, which prevented you from going elsewhere. Did you ever want to join a European team?\\n\\nWell, first of all it was an honor for me. But I pay income tax like anybody else. [Laughs] I was invited—I had several proposals to play in Europe. For Real Madrid, for AC Milan, for Bayern Munich. But at that time, we didn\\'t have too many Brazilian players outside the country. I was very happy at my team, Santos. I didn\\'t have the desire to play outside the country.\\n\\nAnother focus of the film is your friendship with Garrincha, a truly great player himself. Brazil never lost a game when you two played together. What does his friendship mean to you, and what is his legacy?\\n\\nWe were friends on the national team, because I lived in Santos, of course, and he in Rio. But when we had games for Brazil—for a tournament, or whatever—we were together, and Garrincha was the joker. Sometimes I actually had to tell him to settle down. But I have an excellent history with him.\\n\\nWith Garrincha in 1968. Pictorial Parade Getty Images\\n\\nWhen we played in the World Cup in Sweden [in 1958], we went to the local store to buy a radio—one with batteries. At that time in Brazil, it didn\\'t exist—we didn\\'t have them with batteries. We went to the store, and the players—I remember I was with Garrincha, Nilton Santos, and Zito—all experimented with it. They were amazed by the songs on the radio and everything. Everybody started listening to it, different stations, and then we decided we might buy it. And Garrincha says, \"Hey, you\\'re crazy! Why would you take this back to Brazil? They don\\'t speak Portuguese on this radio!\"\\n\\nEverybody thought it was a joke, but he was serious. He said, \"I\\'m not going to buy this, I\\'m not going to buy this.\" That was the kind of guy he was, Garrincha.\\n\\nWhen you did leave Brazil, it was to go to the United States with the New York Cosmos. What did that time in your career mean to you?\\n\\nIt was a bit difficult to decide to go, because I had retired from the national team of Brazil and I had decided I would retire with Santos. I had offers to go to Italy and Spain, but I said, \"No, I\\'m just going to retire.\" But then Mr. Kissinger came to Sao Paulo.\\n\\nElizabeth Griffin\\n\\nHenry Kissinger?\\n\\nHenry Kissinger. He invited me to go to the cafe with him, and there he said, \"Listen. You know I\\'m from the United States, and I\\'m in politics there. Soccer is coming along there—they\\'re playing it in the schools. Would you like to help us promote soccer in the United States? And I said, \"My God.\"\\n\\nI accepted—I said I would go for a year. But I worried a little bit, because the level of play there was not that high yet. But then, once we started to promote it, it became very interesting. They brought over [Franz] Beckenbauer, and [Johan] Cruyff, and Giorio Chinaglia. That\\'s when I said, \"Wow, this is great,\" and I agreed to play three more years. It kept going, they started playing in colleges, and it moved forward.\\n\\nThe other thing I worried about was that I didn\\'t speak great English at the time. I didn\\'t have time to learn. So when I came to the U.S., for the Cosmos, I studied English for four years. And that was important for my life.\\n\\nIs Lionel Messi the greatest player right now? And is it worth comparing him to players from other eras?\\n\\nThere\\'s no doubt he\\'s the best player now. Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best, too, but it\\'s a different style. Messi has the same style as [Diego] Maradona some years ago.',\n",
       " \"There are a lot of reasons why domestic violence victims find it difficult to leave their abusive partners. Financial concerns are often one of the largest. The abusive partner may prevent the other person from working, or may control their wages and bank accounts or credit cards, so survivors of domestic violence often need to start over financially.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n“For a lot of victims, they leave with almost nothing,” says Carolann Peterson, PhD, who teaches courses on domestic violence as an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. “Many times they don’t have any control of the funds within an abusive household.” To help survivors support themselves (and often their children), domestic violence organization FreeFrom provides entrepreneurship training to survivors. The pilot program launched in May in Los Angeles and in June in Oakland and San Francisco with the first cohort of 30 women (80% of whom are mothers). Similar to how a startup incubator helps entrepreneurs, participants receive pro bono legal advice, mentoring, marketing advice, and logo and website help through partnerships with organizations including Kiva, Mission Asset Fund, Centro Community Partners, Bet Tzedek, Start Small Think, and others. The weekly classroom portion lasts six months, but the survivors have access to those resources more informally after that. We just brought an incredible entrepreneur into our program who makes these beautiful cards! We are so excited to help her build her business! ???????????????????????????? A post shared by FreeFrom (@freefromdotorg) on Sep 1, 2017 at 10:46am PDT So far, three-quarters of participants have either launched their business or they’re in the prelaunch stage, and all of them make a profit in their first month of business. They’re almost entirely B2C businesses building on survivors’ existing skills, including a cleaning service, hair styling, catering, and jewelry design. Most importantly: None of the survivors have returned to their abuser.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nA participant who started a handmade greeting card company while living in a shelter (for safety and privacy reasons, we’re not identifying survivors by name) says the program helped her with “picking a name, a business email, a logo, legal advice, setting up goals, and even making a plan around my finances.” She was unsure about launching a business from a shelter with a limited budget but says FreeFrom helped her tackle things step-by-step. “My finances are getting better and will continue to get better as my business grows,” she adds. ????An entrepreneur's workshop ???? A post shared by FreeFrom (@freefromdotorg) on Aug 18, 2017 at 10:14am PDT Another participant says learning about different legal structures for businesses was one of the most valuable parts of FreeFrom’s entrepreneurship program. “This idea became so real when I chose what type of structure my business will be, and when I got to talk to a lawyer about it,” says the participant, who chose sole proprietorship for her mobile hair-braiding company. In addition to the formalized entrepreneur cohorts at FreeFrom, Peterson says some groups of survivors form business co-ops among themselves. For instance, they might start a cleaning service together and take turns cleaning homes or watching each other’s kids. Peterson says survivors who get support in launching a business, even if it’s from peers, are often poised for success despite the financial and emotional challenges their situation poses. “Those are survivors who not only go on to have productive lives, they go on to help others,” she says. “They have the ability to be productive as role models for their kids.” CEO Sonya Passi, who holds a JD degree from the University of California, Berkeley, launched FreeFrom in November of last year. The organization also offers a credit-building program, and Passi felt entrepreneurship would also help survivors build confidence and get on firmer financial footing.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n“Survivors have a really hard time getting regular employment,” Passi says. There are a number of reasons for this. “It’s taking too many sick days because of your injuries, an abuser coming to work and causing a scene, and you losing your job as the result of that, having to flee and having to leave behind your home and your community and your job,” she explains. ”Often survivors don’t have much in the way of a resume, and if they do, it’s very scattered,” Passi says. “As we’re thinking about how survivors can rebuild, often traditional employment isn’t obtainable.” When a survivor does leave an abuser, they may not have access to childcare, which can also make it challenging to hold down a regular job. But they could perhaps make jewelry or provide seamstress services, as some of the survivors in this cohort are doing. Passi feels that while the more flexible requirements of entrepreneurship fit survivors’ needs, their resilience and resourcefulness also makes them ideally suited to start a business. “In order to survive abuse like that, you have to have those skills, and these are the skills that are required to succeed in business,” she says. Still, survivors of domestic violence may face challenges that most other entrepreneurs don’t: privacy and safety. While many entrepreneurs share details of their lives and build their personal brands on YouTube, Snapchat, and Facebook, survivors may have very real concerns about their abuser tracking them down, so they’ll often set up a business that doesn’t use their own name. “The answer for a lot of our clients is having a business that doesn’t require them to put their face and their personal details online, and build it in a way that is fairly anonymous,” Passi says. Did you know that the overwhelming majority of women in prison are survivors of domestic violence? Our team spent the afternoon today learning about how to ensure that our economic empowerment services are accessible to these survivors so that they can rebuild, heal and thrive. ???????????????????? A post shared by FreeFrom (@freefromdotorg) on Oct 12, 2017 at 3:15pm PDT To address the safety concerns of meeting new clients, some participants use Tannia Ventura, FreeFrom’s entrepreneurship program manager, as their check-in buddy. If they’re anxious trusting new people, they’ll text Ventura when they meet with a new client, and when they’re done. “That helps me feel so much safer, and I appreciate that,” says the owner of the mobile hair-braiding company.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nWhile these survivors may not share their names, they do share their stories of survival and resilience. “What’s so extraordinary is they want to own their survivorship,” Passi says. “So much of what our society does is it shames you for being a victim of domestic violence.” Many of these entrepreneurs show solidarity with other survivors by building community into their business model. For instance, Passi says, a survivor might say that for every essential oil kit they sell, they’ll give one to a survivor in a shelter. FreeFrom plans to serve up to 60 clients in each city next year, and expanding its Bay Area reach to include Contra Costa County and East Palo Alto. The organization is also working with the NYC Mayor’s Office to Combat Domestic Violence to bring its program to New York City in 2018.\",\n",

They can also leave a lot lacking in the aesthetics department, unless you’ve got the budget for multiple high-end versions.\\n\\nHowever, a new prosthetics technology could put an end to all that, and although it is early in development, it could truly transform the prosthetics industry for good.\\n\\nThe technology, the brainchild of Oliver Armitage, a final year biomaterials and biomaterial attachments PhD student in the University of Cambridge’s engineering department, is not a specific prosthetic, but a universal attachment system not unlike a computer’s USB.\\n\\nOn the outside any prosthetic can connect to our device via a standard plug-and-play connector\\n\\nReplacing an amputee’s arm or leg stump, the technology is permanently integrated into the bone – known as being osseointegrated – providing a universal connector for any and all prosthetics to attach to. This not only improves the wearer’s comfort, as it avoids the current situation where the skin and flesh on an amputee’s stump is squashed between their bone and prosthetic, but means that prosthetics can be mass produced and sold by retailers, allowing amputees to build a collection for different uses, from sports to black tie.\\n\\n“On the outside any prosthetic can connect to our device via a standard plug-and-play connector,” explained Armitage, who is co-founder and director of the newly-formed Cambridge Bio-Augmentation Systems, which is developing the technology. “On the outside what we’re going to release is an open, public, free-to-develop-for standardized interface, sort of a two-part male and female connector.”\\n\\nWhat’s more, the technology, which will be available through surgery to both new amputees and those with existing stump-and-socket set-ups, will support neural control of prosthetics, something that is by no means universal in current prosthetics technology.\\n\\n“The device also includes the standard neural connection and provides a number of channels of neural data to control the prosthetic,” said Armitage.\\n\\nTruly aesthetic prosthetics\\n\\nPerhaps one of the most exciting aspects of this technology is its potential to widen the range of prosthetics on offer.\\n\\n“Anyone can build a prosthetic for this device or can just buy their new prosthetic online,” said Armitage. “It means that really we can take the delivery of prosthetics out of the healthcare and hospital setting, where we need all this therapy and it needs to be fitted by a specialist, to a position where prosthetics can really be sold as a retail model, because technologically they can be attached very easily and hence and hospitals aren’t required to be involved in that process.”\\n\\nIn particular, this could spark a prosthetics maker culture, where amputees can design and make their own prosthetics for special occasions, cosplay or even to match outfits.\\n\\nI’m aiming for a world in which someone like Nike or Adidas is like ‘here’s the one to play football with’\\n\\n“The thing that really excites me about it is that by having an open standard development platform that anyone can use, you enable prosthetic creativity,” he added. “So yes, you allow all of the current Ottobock and Össur prosthetics to be osseointegrated immediately, and that’s fantastic, it means the majority of patients are going to have better use out of their prosthetics, but what it also means that a guy at home in a shed can decide he wants to make something because it fits exactly his needs.\\n\\n“It doesn’t have to look like an arm; it can be something that looks like an arm, it can be something completely separate to an arm, as long as it fulfils the role that he wants from it. And then he can have multiple, because they’re clip-on, clip-off he can change them for different aspects if the patient so desires.”\\n\\nThis could also result in major retailers designing prosthetics as part of their own fashion lines.\\n\\n“It opens the market not just to lone wolfs – people who have a great idea and go ‘I’m going to try and make one of these’ – but to aesthetic and sportswear manufacturers. I’m aiming for a world in which someone like Nike or Adidas is like ‘here’s the one to play football with’.”\\n\\nCutting the cost of prosthetics\\n\\nWhile there is a clear appeal to amputees, Cambridge Bio-Augmentation Systems needs to also make their proposition appealing to healthcare providers and prosthetics manufacturers if their universal system is to become successful.\\n\\nThe current socket design used for prosthetics is very expensive because each socket has to moulded to the intended user’s stump, but Armitage does not anticipate that changing the connection standard will result in a loss for manufacturers.\\n\\n“The overall cost to prosthetics can come down without us ever having to impinge on the prosthetics manufacturer’s bottom line, because the cost of a prosthetic is built into the socket and the device,” he said. “The manufacturer who is making the device, their device is going to be the same price, but the total cost the patient sees has gone down.”\\n\\nThis approach also means lower costs to healthcare providers, a selling point that is likely to be one of the biggest divers of its adoption.\\n\\n“For a patient it’s a technological argument, for a hospital or a healthcare provider, there’s still the initial surgery, but then there’s a massively reduced cost in the follow-on care of the amputee,” he said.\\n\\nThe system will be installed in a single surgery, replacing the current surgery to form the amputee’s stump, but would completely do-away with the long-term care that is required to treat stump damage and reshaping that is caused by the current socket system.\\n\\n“All of that follow-on care that currently exists around caring for the stump is incurred by the healthcare provider, so our value proposition to the healthcare provider is the reduced follow-on and lifetime costs of amputee care as well as the prosthetic they’re buying for the patient being cheaper.“\\n\\nBoosting amputee comfort\\n\\nOf course for patients the biggest draw will undoubtedly be the added comfort that this system provides. At present, prosthetics see a significant drop-off over time due to the discomfort they can cause, but Armitage believes their osseointegrated system could put an end to this.\\n\\n“There are a lot of amputees who choose not to wear a lot of prosthetics at the moment, but to me when I’ve technologically got there is when I see an amputee get home and decide not to take their prosthetic off,” he said.\\n\\n“Right now I get home in a shirt and trousers and I instantly change into sweats; amputees get home and take their prosthetic off and go ‘oh great, I don’t have to wear that anymore’ but I’m aiming for a scenario where it’s not actually desirable to do that.”\\n\\nThere are a lot of amputees who choose not to wear a lot of prosthetics at the moment\\n\\nAnd what’s more, trials results from other non-neural osseointegrated devices suggest that this type of connection can indeed boost comfort.\\n\\n“There’s a couple of osseointegrated devices around now – they’re not aiming for the same level of technological features as we are – but there’s been some published literature surrounding how amputees with osseointegrated devices feel, and they report a much higher sense of self around their prosthetic,” he said.\\n\\n“They see it as much more part of them rather than as an assistive device, and that is because it is starting to be integrated and is performing higher function. Especially for upper leg amputees – they find certain actions like sitting much more comfortable.”\\n\\nParalympian benefits\\n\\nThis improvement in comfort is likely to be particularly appealing to amputee athletes, such as paralympians, as wear on the stump is one of the biggest roadblocks to effective training.\\n\\n“It’s not their cardiology and their muscular systems, it’s the sores and the pain at the end of their stumps,” said Armitage.\\n\\n“They have to wait for those to heal as they start to wear, because effectively you’re putting biomechanical load through a load of skin. So if you think about it, you’ve got the prosthetic, which is effectively functioning like your bone, it’s taking the load, and then you’ve got a lump of soft tissue, with skin on it, and then bone again.\\n\\n“So the load has to go through this lump of soft tissue, which isn’t in any way designed to take it.”\\n\\nTimescale to reality\\n\\nAs exciting as the technology is, there is some way to go before it will be available to amputees.\\n\\nAlthough Armitage has been working on the technology in some form for the last four years, Cambridge Bio-Augmentation Systems was only incorporated in early May this year, and will be filing patents on the inside of the device within the next few months.\\n\\nHowever, the company has already garnered considerable attention and support from startup accelerators despite its early stage.\\n\\n“We’re part of MassChallenge accelerator, but also we’ve received some pre-seed funding from the Founder.org accelerator, which is based out of California, and they’re run by Michael Baum, a very sucessful Silicon Valley entrepreneur,” said Armitage.\\n\\n“He, through Founder.org, has given us some pre-seed money, and then we’re in a position where over the next eight months to a year we’re ramping up to be in a position to start our first animal trials, to start the medical device approval process.”\\n\\nGetting a medical device approved for human use can be a lengthy process, requiring multiple steps to prove its safety and effectiveness. However, Armitage is confident of gaining full approval within the decade, and getting the device implanted in humans long before that.\\n\\n“If we do well and we plan our regulatory strategy well and we get through in the shortest time it could be something like five or six years from now, in the worst case it could be eight to ten,” he said.\\n\\n“It will start being used in human patients in about three years, that’s in the initial very small, probably about ten people, clinical trials and then probably a year to two years after that you would start an open clinical trial where a much wider group can have it, and people can at that point opt in and say ‘yeah, I’d quite like one’.\\n\\n“ So the first point at which people could really say ‘I would like one of these’ would be somewhere around five years from now, but they’d have to go to a specific hospital that was conducting the trial, and then maybe around two years after that it would hit the wider market.”',\n",

       " 'The science of human endurance is fascinating because it is so little understood, so variable, and because excelling at a monumental task isn’t simply a matter of physical strength. “If races were really just plumbing contests—tests of whose pipes could deliver the most oxygen and pump the most blood—they would be boringly deterministic,” writes Alex Hutchinson in Endure: Mind, Body and the Curiously Elastic Limits of Human Performance. “You race once, and you know your limits. But that’s not how it works.” After 24 hours of physical exertion, it isn’t baseline strength that matters as much as mental fortitude, and grit is equally available to both sexes. The same weekend as the Revenant ultra run featured in this issue took place, a British woman, Jasmine Paris, won a 431-kilometre mountain race along the Pennine Way between England and Scotland. (Her time of 83 hours, 12 minutes set a new course record.) Viewing the Revenant in person involved a lot of waiting on tussock-clad hillsides, but I was enthralled, fully invested in the success or failure of 21 people I’d only just met. An ultra runner requires the qualities we most admire about the New Zealand psyche—they are proto-New Zealanders. We value effort when no one’s watching. We value persistence over talent, and across extremely long distances, sheer stubbornness—call it bloody-mindedness—is what prevails. We value toughness, the kind that can’t be built in gyms or isolated by sports scientists. We value capability and self-sufficiency. In the Revenant, runners figure out a route across trackless land, face up to the elements, judge the time from the setting of the moon or the rising of the sun. They cannot receive any help. “It comes down to the ability to keep going at any pace,” says Dave Viitakangas, who is on the cover of this issue. (He completed a full loop of the course, despite an injury.) Ultra running prompts us to ask the question: how would we fare if it was only our mental strength on the line? The pursuit of that great reckoning of psychological fortitude is what draws people in increasing numbers to marathons, to long missions in the hills. “When you are by yourself and you know that you are the only one that you can rely on, I feel like that’s when you are the sharpest as a human being,” said one of the Revenant runners, United States Navy SEAL Chadd Wright, in a Trail Runner Nation podcast after the race. “When you can’t look to someone else to have that courage in a moment of weakness and you’re by yourself and you know your only option is to rely on yourself—at times you can be sharper at that point than you would be within a group.” Wright raced in a team of two, but the pair of them experienced a moment of intense isolation. Emerging after nearly 30 hours from a psychologically difficult section of the course, his teammate wondered about contacting the race organisers to let them know where they were. The realisation dawned on Wright: “No one cares where we are.” Acknowledging it was a form of liberation: returning to home base was entirely up to him, and when he finally arrived back, the achievement would be entirely his. That’s the whole purpose of the Revenant. Here, the only race takes place within. Sure, the Revenant has its critics—too long, too hard, inspires people to do dangerous things. And why create an event where you expect everyone to lose, anyway? “If you’re going to face a real challenge, it has to be a real challenge,” said Gary Cantrell, the founder of the Barkley Marathons, a difficult ultra race in Tennessee. The Barkley has become legendary, attracting documentary crews, as well as news coverage every time it’s run, even though most years, no one finishes. Cantrell started the Barkley for one reason entirely: “You can’t accomplish anything without the possibility of failure.”',\n",
       " '\\n\\nLooking for a motorcycle to complement your classic Ferrari? Most guys would opt for something that’s also Italian and red—like a Ducati. But one collector wanted something truly unique, so he reached out to Art Henschell of One-Up Moto Garage with a very special brief.\\n\\nIn his collection is something even more rare than the Testarossa in these photos; a 1965 NART Le Mans Ferrari racing car. He wanted a bike inspired by his beloved vintage racer, with one caveat: it had to be powered by a Honda CB600F motor.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He already owns another of my Honda CB600F builds,” explains Art, “and he loved the power, feel and reliability of that engine so much, he wanted this one to have the same qualities. I tried to get him to go with a Ducati, but he just wasn’t having it.”\\n\\n“Silver lining: you probably won’t see another Honda-based ‘Ferrari bike’ ever again!”\\n\\n\\n\\nArt runs One-Up Moto Garage as a one-man-band, out of his home workshop in Fayetteville, Arkansas. There, he began gathering together the parts that would eventually become ‘Rosso Corsa.’\\n\\n“There wasn’t any one donor bike to begin with,” he explains. “My inventory is almost entirely a collection of Craigslist finds that I store for future work.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe starting point was a 2006 Honda CB600F Hornet motor and frame. Then Art sourced a VFR800 from a salvage yard, and pillaged it for its swing arm, rear shock and wheels.\\n\\n“I chose the race-inspired single sided swing arm because of its track-based origins and the car-like rear wheel aesthetic,” he says. “It also allowed me to tuck the twin pipes up behind the rear sets, so they don’t get in the way of a good corner lean.”\\n\\n\\n\\nGetting the rear end to look (and sit) right took a little thinking. Art designed a new subframe and shock mounts, then plasma cut the final parts and assembled it. The frame and swing-arm were powder coated black, and the wheels gold. “Gold rims are a tradition for race Ferraris,” he quips, “so of course I had to powder them appropriately.”\\n\\nUp front, Art mounted a set of rebuilt and shortened CBR upside-downs. They’re held in place by custom-made triple trees—specifically designed with an integrated smartphone mount. (An app on the rider’s smartphone now handles speedo duties.)\\n\\n\\n\\nUp top is a hand-shaped, 18-gauge steel fuel tank. “Gas tanks are the focal point of a bike, so I created one that had both the smooth curves and the hard edges of this build’s muse,” says Art.\\n\\nThere’s a new seat just behind the tank, custom-made by Art from start to finish. It consists of a PVC base, closed cell neoprene foam with gel inserts, and a two-tone leather cover.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I went with the classic diamond stitch tan on black because it is a common finish in vintage Ferraris,” he says. “I upholstered it on a walking-foot JUKI industrial sewing machine that sits in my living room.”\\n\\nOn the performance side, Art has left the motor mostly stock, But he’s vapor-honed the carbs, rejetted them, and fitted UNI pod filters. He then pie-cut and TIG-welded a new stainless steel four-into-two exhaust system, terminating it with a pair of Lossa Engineering mufflers.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe’s showed the electrical system some love too, rewiring everything around his own “secret power hub design,” which hides under the tank. Upgrades include a lithium-ion battery from Shorai, a MOSFET regulator/rectifier, and Motogadget turn signals.\\n\\nTwo rows of LEDs under the new seat act as a taillight, but it’s the headlight shroud that caught our attention first. “I made it out of stainless rod and perforated metal,” says Art. “The engine shrouds on Ferraris often have a mesh cover, so I made it to reflect that. On all my builds, creating a unique faceplate is a fun challenge for me.”\\n\\n\\n\\nClip-ons and custom-made adjustable rear sets (with neat carbon heel guards) round out the package. There are more details lurking, but Art wants to keep a few secrets to himself. What’s remarkable though, is that everything you see here he handled himself.\\n\\n“Only thing I don’t do is the powder coating,” he says. “I live right by an industrial powder coater and they do an unbeatable job.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe even took care of the paint, shooting the tank in Ferrari’s signature Rosso Corsa. Eric Snodgrass added a final touch, with a hand-painted Ferrari shield on the swing arm, modded with the One-Up logo.\\n\\nWith the bike all buttoned up and ready to ship, Art had one small problem left to tackle. His client lives in Miami, so he couldn’t shoot the Honda alongside the car that inspired it. Luckily Ehrlich Motorwerks jumped in with this 1986 Testarossa for our viewing pleasure.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s refreshing to know that the owner could simply have gone out and bought a Superleggera. Instead, he chose the autostrada less traveled and got something truly hand-built…and arguably more charming.\\n\\nOne-Up Moto Garage | Instagram | Images by FOR THE LOVE OF AUTO, a division of Blk Elk Media',\n",

       " 'July 2, 2015 — Ron Chusid\\n\\nAfter one recent poll showed Sanders pulling within eight points of Clinton in New Hampshire, another poll now shows him gaining in Iowa:\\n\\nHillary Clinton enjoys a 19-point lead among likely Democratic caucus-goers in the key state of Iowa over her nearest challenger, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, but that advantage has shrunk 26 points since May, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday. The former secretary of state gets the support of 52 percent of her party’s likely caucus-goers in the state, which holds the nation’s first nominating contest, while Sanders, a Senate independent and self-described socialist seeking the Democratic nomination, pulls in support from 33 percent. In May, the split was 60 percent to 15 percent. It is the first time Clinton has received less than 60 percent support in the poll, according to assistant poll director Peter A. Brown.\\n\\nWhile Clinton still has the lead for the nomination, there are still several months for Sanders to make up this deficit. Typically the Iowa polls remain quite volatile with many caucus voters not deciding until the last minute. National polls for the nomination are virtually meaningless at this point as candidates who do well in Iowa and New Hampshire typically show a major bounce after victories in the first two contests.\\n\\nSanders also had a good day campaigning in Wisconsin:\\n\\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) drew 10,000 supporters, the largest crowd of his campaign thus far, according to reports. “Tonight, we have more people at any meeting for a candidate of president of the United States than any other candidate,” Sanders told his fans at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Madison, Wis., according to The Associated Press\\n\\nGallup shows that the Democrats have regained their advantage in party affiliation:\\n\\nIn the second quarter of 2015, Democrats regained an advantage over Republicans in terms of Americans’ party affiliation. A total of 46% of Americans identified as Democrats (30%) or said they are independents who lean toward the Democratic Party (16%), while 41% identified as Republicans (25%) or leaned Republican (16%). The two parties were generally even during the previous three quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2014, when the midterm elections took place… Democratic gains in party affiliation may be partly linked to more positive views of President Barack Obama, whose job approval ratings were near his personal lows last fall but have recovered, perhaps related to low unemployment, lower gas prices than a year ago and an easing of some of the international challenges that faced the U.S., such as the Ukraine-Russia situation.',\n",

Today is Wednesday, so that means this is our first #ChibiWednesday ! Like all the other hashtags, all chibis can be found with #ChibiWednesday . I'm very proud of myself for sticking it out this long, and not caving in. To tell the truth I'm... kinda beginning to like this schedule. Crazy right?As far as chibi's go, I plan to do both human and pony chibis. Much like the mermaids, I'll never really run out of material for these, unless I choose to end it.

       " 'MILAN (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors are investigating leading humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), a legal source said on Saturday, over its role in rescuing migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea.\\n\\nItalian police on Wednesday seized a migrant rescue boat operated by German organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration.\\n\\nA legal source now says that MSF is also part of the investigation over the alleged rescue of migrants carried out just off the Libyan coast when there was no immediate threat to their safety.\\n\\nMSF said in a statement it had not been notified of the inquiry and that it stood ready to cooperate with prosecutors since similar accusations first surfaced in the press months ago.\\n\\n“We hope any doubts can be dispelled soon to end this trickling of accusations that poisons the atmosphere in an ever gloomier situation,” it said.\\n\\nItaly is under pressure to manage new arrivals because some 600,000 migrants have reached it by sea from North Africa since 2014. Immigration has become a potent political issue ahead of elections in spring 2018.\\n\\nIn a press interview on Saturday, Luigi Di Maio, who is expected to lead the populist Five-Star movement in next year’s vote, called for “an immediate stop to the sea-taxi service”. The Five-Star is ahead of the ruling Democratic Party in polls.\\n\\nRome has asked eight NGOs to sign a code of conduct for the southern Mediterranean, including a demand that they carry an armed policemen on board their boats.\\n\\nOnly four aid groups have agreed to it.\\n\\nItaly’s Interior Minister Marco Minniti urged the four NGOs that have not signed the document to do so.\\n\\n“Those who do not sign cannot remain part of Italy’s rescue system, though nobody is questioning the law of the sea and international treaties,” he said in an interview with Saturday’s Il Fatto Quotidiano.\\n\\n“Because migrants arrive in Italy, we must find a balance between their rights and those of the country that hosts them. We need complete trust between those who carry out the rescues and the country that opens up its ports,” he said.\\n\\nMSF said in the statement that it would respect most of the code’s tenets, but could not sign it as it neglected humanitarian principles and elements which it considers essential for rescues to be effective.',\n",
       " 'An artist\\'s illustration of Ceres based on mapping and observations from NASA\\'s Dawn spacecraft currently orbiting the dwarf planet in the Asteroid Belt.\\n\\nCeres is a dwarf planet, the only one located in the inner reaches of the solar system; the rest lie at the outer edges, in the Kuiper Belt. While it is the smallest of the known dwarf planets, it is the largest object in the asteroid belt.\\n\\nUnlike other rocky bodies in the asteroid belt, Ceres is an oblate spheroid, rounded with a rotational bulge around its equator. Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere. The recent arrival of a probe has unlocked some of the dwarf planet\\'s secrets, but others remain hidden. [See more photos of the dwarf planet Ceres]\\n\\nBright spots & lonely mountains\\n\\nOn March 6, 2015, NASA\\'s Dawn spacecraft became the first probe to orbit two bodies in the solar system. After leaving the asteroid Vesta, Dawn traveled to Ceres, an icy world that has tantalized scientists for years. While most asteroids are made of rock, Ceres revealed hints that it could contain water on its surface since 1991, though those hints remained unconfirmed for more than 20 years.\\n\\nMost of the surface is a dull gray. Spectral observations from Ceres have revealed the presence of a form of graphite known as graphitized carbon.\\n\\n\"It hasn\\'t evolved to proper graphite,\" Amanda Hendrix, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona, told Space.com. But it\\'s close.\\n\\nAs Dawn drew closer to the giant asteroid, a bright spot on its surface grew clearer. After observing Ceres, 130 similar spots of varying brightness were found on the planet. The surface of Ceres is generally as reflective as freshly poured asphalt, while the spots ranged from the dull sheen of concrete to the startling brightness of ice floating on Earth\\'s oceans. The brightest region lies in the 56-mile-wide (90 kilometers) Occator Crater, which contains the most famous collections of shining spots on the surface of Ceres.\\n\\nEarly speculation regarding the spots included the possibility of ice volcanoes on the dwarf planet. However, only a single \"lonely mountain\" rises from the surface. The pyramid-shaped mountain rises to an altitude of 21,120 feet (6,437 meters). The 4-mile high mountain stands solitary, with no evidence of volcanic or other geologic activity to suggest its puzzling origin.\\n\\nAlthough a study of the spots originally found signatures of hydrated magnesium sulfates, the same material that makes up Epsom salt back on Earth, further examination revealed chemical signatures of sodium carbonate. Formed from carbon, on Earth the material is often left behind as water evaporates, suggesting that the salts formed in the watery conditions beneath the crust. Most of the bright regions are associated with craters, suggesting that their formation could be related to impacts. These findings tie into earlier understanding of the formation of the dwarf planet.\\n\\nCeres\\' features are named for agricultural spirits and gods, and were approved by the International Astronomical Union in 2015. Ceres itself was named for the Roman goddess of corn and harvests.\\n\\nA once-wet world\\n\\nCeres may look dry and gray, but it probably held a liquid ocean in its past. Dawn used the dwarf planet\\'s own bulk to map its gravity field. Combined with observations of the icy surfaces, the observations reveal traces of an ocean in the crust, with signs of a muddy mantle below the surface.\\n\\nCeres has a density of 2.09 grams per cubic centimeter, leading scientists to conclude approximately a quarter of its weight is water. This would give the dwarf planet more fresh water than Earth contains. By comparison, Earth has a density of 5.52 grams per cubic centimeter. Before Dawn visited the dwarf planet, scientists already suspected that it could hide a liquid or frozen ocean; the visiting satellite helped dive into the secrets lurking beneath the planet\\'s surface.\\n\\nScientists think that water-ice serves as the mantle of the dwarf planet. The thin, dusty crust is thought to be composed of rock, while a rocky inner core lies at the center. Spectral observations of Ceres from Earth reveal that the surface contains iron-rich clays. Signs of carbonates have similarly been found, making Ceres one of the only bodies in the solar system known to contain these minerals, the other two being Earth and Mars. Formed by a process that involves heat and water, carbonates are considered good potential indicators of habitability. [The Search for Life on Mars (A Photo Timeline)\\n\\n\"That was something we had not expected,\" Chris Russell, Dawn\\'s principal investigator and planetary scientist at University of California, Los Angeles, told Space.com in 2016. \"The carbonates are a very strong indication of the processes now that we believe took place in the interior, that makes it more Earthlike, when it can alter the chemistry inside.\"\\n\\nSalts would lower the freezing temperature of water hidden within the crust, keeping it from freezing as quickly as pure water might do.\\n\\nWhen large bodies crash into Ceres, they may scoop out a region of the crust, cutting into the icy mantle beneath to leave the ice closer to surface. When sunlight heats the outer layer, the ice could go from solid to gas through a process known as sublimation.\\n\\nIn 2014, the European Space Agency\\'s Herschel Space Observatory detected plumes of water vapor escaping from the dwarf planet at a rate of 13 lbs. (6 kilograms) per second.\\n\\n\"This is the first clear-cut detection of water on Ceres and in the asteroid belt in general,\" Michael Küppers of the European Space Agency, Villanueva de la Cañada, Spain, told Space.com in 2014. Küppers led the study of the vapor that appeared in Nature.\\n\\nBut not all of the water is hidden beneath the surface. Dawn has revealed growing patches of ice and minerals related to liquid water on the tiny world.\\n\\nAndrea Raponi, a researcher at the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), found a growing patch of ice on the floor of Juling Crater, scraped out near the mid-latitudes. A second team, led by Filippo Giacomo Carrozzo, also of INAF, revealed changes in the soil that they suspect are tied to carbonates.\\n\\n\"The same process can be at work in the crater floor of Juling, providing a replenishment of water under the soil that sublimates and in part condenses on the cold wall,\" Raponi told Space.com.\\n\\n\"The two works show that water is currently available on the surface of Ceres and produces geological and mineralogical changes on its surface,\" he said.\\n\\nThese patches may change as the planet tilts over thousands of years. Ceres\\' tilt relative to its orbit changes from 2 degrees to about 20 degrees over the course of 24,500 years, a relatively short time astronomically speaking. This can cause dramatic swings in which craters can continue to hide water over long periods of time. Right now, while Ceres\\' tilt is near its minimum, large swaths of land around the poles don\\'t receive direct sunlight. But 14,000 years ago, when Ceres was at its maximum tilt, those regions shrank, leaving only a handful of areas where ice could continue to hide throughout the shift.\\n\\n\"The idea that ice could survive on Ceres for long periods of time is important as we continue to reconstruct the dwarf planet\\'s geological history, including whether it has been giving off water vapor,\" said study co-author and Dawn deputy principal investigator Carol Raymond, also of JPL, in a statement.\\n\\nDawn also discovered organic-rich areas on the surface and determined that they were most likely native to the dwarf planet. Data from the spacecraft suggest that the organic materials most likely were delivered to the surface from the dwarf planet\\'s interior.\\n\\n\"This discovery of a locally high concentration of organics is intriguing, with broad implications for the astrobiology community,\" said Dr. Simone Marchi, a senior research scientist at Southwest Research Institute, said in a statement. \"Ceres has evidence of ammonia-bearing hydrated minerals, water ice, carbonates, salts, and now organic materials. With this new finding Dawn has shown that Ceres contains key ingredients for life.\"\\n\\nCeres is thought to contain a thin outer layer of dust and rock over an icy layer. (Image: © NASA/ESA/STScI)\\n\\nHistory & discovery\\n\\nAstronomers in the late 18th century mathematically predicted the presence of a planet between Mars and Jupiter, eagerly turning their telescopes to the region in search of the missing body. On Jan. 1, 1801, Sicilian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered what was then considered a planet, naming it Ceres for the Roman goddess.\\n\\nWithin a decade, four new objects were discovered in the same region, all also considered planets. Nearly 50 years passed before more, smaller bodies were found scattered between Mars and Jupiter — the components of the asteroid belt — and Ceres was demoted to the status of an asteroid.\\n\\nIn 2006, Ceres was promoted to the status of a dwarf planet; it did not reach full planetary status because it failed to gravitationally clear its neighborhood of debris, though it often retains its classification as an asteroid, as well. [Infographic: Dwarf Planets in the Solar System]\\n\\nThe largest object in the asteroid belt, Ceres makes up nearly a third of its mass. Even so, it remains the smallest known dwarf planet, only 590 miles (950 km) across — roughly the size of Texas. A day on Ceres lasts a little over 9 Earth-hours, while it takes 4.6 Earth-years to travel around the sun.\\n\\nThe close proximity and low mass of Ceres have led some scientists to suggest that it could serve as a potential site for manned landings and a launching point for manned deep space missions.\\n\\nThe source of Earth\\'s water?\\n\\nUnlike most of the asteroid belt, Ceres contains a significant amount of ice. This could mean similar worlds in the early solar system could have been responsible for bringing water to Earth.\\n\\nUnder current solar system models, Earth would have formed primarily rocky. Any water it held on its surface would have been vaporized when a large protoplanet collided with it to form the moon. For a long time, scientists thought that comets might have delivered water to the reformed Earth as they collided with its surface. However, comet-studying probes have shown that the icy rocks don\\'t contain the right kind of water for their siblings to be responsible for those deliveries. New studies have turned to objects known as main belt asteroids, rock and icy neighbors of Ceres.\\n\\n\"One quarter of the mass of Ceres is water, and three quarters is rock,\" Russell told Space.com in 2015.\\n\\n\"If we had just a few Ceres-type bodies colliding with the Earth, we can explain where the water came from.\"\\n\\nAdditional resources\\n\\nFollow Nola Taylor Redd at @NolaTRedd, Facebook, or Google+.

       " 'Chinese personal shoppers have created a new type of retail store in Australia\\n\\nUpdated\\n\\nIt might seem unlikely that there are stores selling only a small range of products at prices significantly higher than supermarkets yet turning over millions of dollars each year.\\n\\nBut an increase in stores catering to personal shoppers, called daigou, are growing in the Australian retail scene.\\n\\nAs demand for Australian products increases, daigou stores allow Chinese shoppers to send goods to China. One public relation agency estimated there are between 1,200 to 1,600 small daigou stores that offer \"pack and send\" services in Australia. Until now, these businesses were fragmented and operated independently.\\n\\nHowever, the first Daigou retailer recently listed on the ASX, AuMake. The retailer has seven stores in Sydney and plans for more.\\n\\nDaigou stores are emerging in response to the demands of a burgeoning Chinese middle class and their hunger for Australian brands. By 2022, 76 per cent of China\\'s urban population will be considered middle class.\\n\\nWhy Australian brands can\\'t \\'go it alone\\'\\n\\nPoor quality Chinese products, food safety concerns combined with ongoing issues of counterfeiting have contributed to a deficit in trust of Chinese brands. This lack of trust is driving demand for authentic, high quality products - particularly from Western markets like Australia.\\n\\nSo, why don\\'t Australian business simply cut out the middleman and go straight to the consumer?\\n\\nIt comes down to the establishment of trust between the consumer and the retailer, and the length of time it takes a foreign retail business to establish consumer trust in China. Australian-based brands like Suisse, Blackmores and Jurlique sell through Daigou retailers to quickly establish authenticity of the product and consumer trust.\\n\\nDaigou businesses are quickly becoming market influencers, that can make or break brands in China. Case in point is Bellamy\\'s infant formula — Airwallex Founder Lucy Liu stated:\\n\\n\"What Bellamy\\'s didn\\'t expect was that the daigous\\' customers would be more loyal to their daigou, than to the Bellamy\\'s brand.\"\\n\\nChinese consultancies are now offering to connect Australian businesses with highly-influential Chinese bloggers and Chinese social media personalities to help promote products and services.\\n\\nA viable market\\n\\nDespite low domestic growth in food and groceries, an AFGC State of the Industry Report identified a real hunger for Australian manufactured brands internationally. In 2015-16 food and beverage exports grew by 11 per cent to $26 billion and grocery (non-food) exports up 32 per cent to $4 billion.\\n\\nNotably, China has become Australia\\'s largest export market for the first time in 2016-17.\\n\\nSo lucrative is this daigou model, that the 2017 Australia-China Business Week Conference allocated an entire afternoon to a workshop on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The aim of the session was to demonstrate to marketers and business how WeChat could be utilised to connect, influence and sell to Chinese consumers.\\n\\nGlobal consultancy firms like Nielsen are scrambling to advise entrepreneurs and brands on how they can leverage this new retail model for financial growth.\\n\\nA final cautionary note\\n\\nAs these daigou stores open up around Australia and become the legitimate \"go to\" for Chinese consumers seeking quality, authentic Australian brands, it would appear the days of individual daigous stripping supermarket shelves of infant formula may be numbered. The model provides a regulated channel to the Chinese consumer and circumnavigates the need for individual daigou shoppers.\\n\\nWhile this new retail model presents a great opportunity for Australian products and brands, ultimately, the future remains uncertain. On one hand, Chinese entrepreneurs may increase the number of stores across Australia and small brands will compete for shelf space, in order to access the lucrative Chinese market. Alternatively, established daigou relationships based on trust may endue and the business model becomes irrelevant.\\n\\nIn the end, this retail model remains viable only as long as the Chinese government permit online shopping from international markets - they could close the door overnight.\\n\\nChinese officials have already imposed bans on foreign books, movies and games being imported to China.\\n\\nTopics: community-and-society, business-economics-and-finance, retail, industry, china, australia\\n\\nFirst posted',\n",

       " 'By Collin Morris, News Editor\\n\\nMurray State’s infamous explosion sent a shockwave across campus on June 28. In its aftermath, not only do gaping holes lie at the base of James H. Richmond Residential College, but also in the university’s emergency prevention measures.\\n\\nAfter consulting with seven other Kentucky schools, The News learned Murray State is one of four major universities lacking natural gas detection systems in its residence halls.\\n\\nWhile natural gas detectors are not explicitly required per Kentucky’s state building code, the University of Kentucky, the University of Louisville and Western Kentucky University exceeded those guidelines, equipping each of their respective residence halls with natural gas detectors.\\n\\nMurray State, Eastern Kentucky University, Northern Kentucky University and Morehead State University are not equipped with natural gas detectors in their student housing.\\n\\nAt the University of Louisville, the campus has transitioned away from natural gas, but remains equipped with detectors where applicable.\\n\\n“All of our buildings have basically the same type of system set up such that they have a comprehensive detection system, whether it be smoke, fire or gas,” said University of Louisville’s Fire Marshal Dwain Archer. He added the university overwhelmingly uses steam or electric power from their central power plant.\\n\\nAbout an hour away, on the campus of its athletic foes, the University of Kentucky has found common ground with the Cardinals, mirroring their transition away from natural gas.\\n\\n“We have very few pieces of gas-fired equipment, we have some gas-powered generators, but as far as everyday use we have very few facilities using it, and if we do they would have carbon monoxide detectors in those facilities,” University of Kentucky Fire Marshal Greg Williamson said.\\n\\nWilliamson also said the University of Kentucky installs detectors congruent with any other forms of gas used in its building.\\n\\nAt Western Kentucky, Fire Marshal Bob Austin testified to their system, which not only detects natural gas, but immediately alerts authorities.\\n\\n“Basically everything that is gas-powered or [powered by] boilers, or gas water heaters are located in an isolated area away from the residential hall areas, but we do have the CO detectors in those areas, which are interconnected with the fire alarm system,” Austin said. “If they do go off then they set the alarm off in the building, and it would have to be investigated.”\\n\\nWhen asked if Western Kentucky keeps gas-powered utilities close enough to residential halls to ever see a situation similar to Murray State’s, Austin responded, “not even close.”\\n\\nOf the schools lacking these comprehensive gas detection systems, only Eastern Kentucky was able to defer to alternate safety measures, citing their handheld detectors, which may be used manually once a potential leak is reported.\\n\\n“Obviously we don’t have any gas stoves within the residence halls themselves, those are all electrically operated,” Eastern Kentucky Fire Marshal Brad Early said. “Our main form of detection is if we’ve got somebody that smells it, we’ll get a phone call and head over there. We’ve got detectors ourselves that are handheld.”\\n\\nAfter the gas regulator collision on Murray State’s campus, responders performed a soaping test, according to documents obtained by The News in an Open Records Request.\\n\\nNo leaks were detected by that test.\\n\\nThe soaping test is executed by pouring soapy water in areas suspected of gas leaks. If bubbles form in the air, the area is the site of a potential gas leak.\\n\\nThe regulator was then replaced, and the area declared safe. More than four hours later, New Richmond exploded.\\n\\nEarly stressed the urgency and severity of potential gas leaks at Eastern Kentucky.\\n\\n“We activate a fire alarm and go in and inspect immediately – that’s a priority one call.” Early said.\\n\\nMorehead State’s Director of Risk and Compliance James Frazier deferred questions about their systems to aforementioned state regulations.\\n\\n“We operate off of building code, so [we follow] whatever building code requires at the time of construction,” he said.\\n\\nNorthern Kentucky officials confirmed its situation to be similar to Murray State’s, including a lack of gas detectors.\\n\\n“In residence halls, natural gas is used only for commercial cooking…and for clothes dryers in common laundry rooms, boilers, and emergency generators maintained by Facilities Management,” Jeffrey Baker, director of safety and emergency management at Northern Kentucky, wrote in an email. “Natural gas is not available in the individual residential sleeping units. Stoves and ovens that are made available for use by students are powered by electric.”\\n\\nIn response to questions regarding the absence of detectors, Vice President of University Advancement Adrienne King wrote, “The building is/was not equipped with natural gas detectors as this is not a building code requirement.”\\n\\nThe Kentucky State Fire Marshal’s investigation has been ongoing since the case was deemed non-criminal and transferred from the Kentucky State Police on June 29. The assumed impact of natural gas detectors remains unknown. King deferred to the investigation when asked if other Murray State residence halls could see a similar fate as New Richmond.',\n",
       " 'A pro-Michele Bachmann ad claims that “doctors opposed [Rick] Perry’s order [to inject girls with HPV vaccine] for safety reasons.” But the pediatrician cited by the sponsor says the ad doesn’t reflect his views accurately. “At the time, my position was that the vaccine was safe and effective,” he told FactCheck.org. Although he had reservations about a government mandate, he was personally recommending the vaccine for all 11- and 12-year-old girls, the doctor told us.\\n\\nFurthermore, the ad overreaches when it says that “Perry’s wife had worked for the company that makes the vaccine.” Anita Perry worked part time for a public relations firm that Merck hired to promote a public education campaign for osteoporosis screenings — 10 years before Perry’s decision to issue his executive order.\\n\\nPerry’s foes continue to botch an otherwise ripe attack on Perry regarding his controversial 2007 executive order requiring 11- and 12-year-old girls to get a vaccine designed to prevent a sexually transmitted disease that can lead to cervical cancer. The Texas Legislature beat back Perry’s order, and Perry has since admitted he made a mistake by not running it through the Legislature first. Moreover, there is plenty of fodder for Bachmann’s suggestion that Perry’s decision smacks of “crony capitalism.” Perry has received more than $26,000 from Merck in gubernatorial campaign contributions over the years. And Perry’s former chief of staff became a lobbyist for Merck.\\n\\nBut Bachmann’s attacks have backfired a bit due to her medically unsubstantiated claims that the vaccine is “potentially dangerous,” as well as her repeated retelling of an anecdote in which a mother said the vaccine caused her daughter to suffer mental retardation.\\n\\nDid Doctors Have Safety Concerns?\\n\\nIn TV ads running on Fox News in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Keep Conservatives United, a pro-Bachmann super PAC, offers two new lines of attack in the ongoing dissection of Perry’s executive order. On its website, Keep Conservatives United acknowledges that “doctors affirm Merck’s HPV vaccine is safe today.” But back when Perry issued his order, the ad states, “doctors opposed Perry’s order for safety reasons.”\\n\\nTo underpin that claim, the ad features a pullout quote from Dr. Joseph A. Bocchini in a March 5, 2007, National Review article: “It would be wise to wait until we have additional information about the safety of the vaccine.”\\n\\nBocchini is chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center – Shreveport. He is also a member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and chairs the ACIP’s HPV working group. Bocchini was among those who chastised Bachmann’s “potentially unsafe” comments last week, saying, “The evidence is that there is no serious risk to the use of this vaccine.”\\n\\nBut did he once oppose Perry’s mandate for safety reasons? That’s only half right, Bocchini told us via email:\\n\\nBocchini: Neither the ad nor the story published in 2007 accurately reflect my position at the time. At the time, my position was that the vaccine was safe and effective. In fact, my recommendation at that time was that all girls 11-12 should receive the vaccine as part of their routine immunization panel and that girls and young women from 13 through 26 years of age should also receive the vaccine. At the time of the interview I indicated that additional data on safety, duration of immunity, change in epidemiology of HPV infection and whether most girls in the recommended age group were receiving the vaccine would be considerations for whether a mandate would be indicated. That is why I said that it was too early. Only a portion of my statements was published in the story, which incorrectly implied that I was concerned about safety.\\n\\nSeveral stories at the time confirm Bocchini’s position that he recommended the HPV vaccine for female patients ages 11 to 26. That was also the recommendation of CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices after the FDA approved — following extensive review and study — Merck’s Gardasil in 2006 for use in females ages 9 to 26 to protect against cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and genital warts caused by HPV. Stories at the time also note that organizations such as the Texas Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics similarly recommended use of the vaccine, even as they declined to endorse a mandate.\\n\\nPerry’s Wife Part of the Cronyism Problem?\\n\\nTo back up her suggestion that crony capitalism influenced Perry’s decision, Bachmann has repeatedly pointed out that Perry’s onetime chief of staff, Mike Toomey, was a lobbyist for Merck when Perry made his decision to issue the executive order. Toomey recently cofounded a super PAC called Make Us Great Again, which is backing Perry’s presidential bid.\\n\\nBut the Keep Conservatives United ad takes the case one step further, claiming the cronyism extends to Perry’s own house.\\n\\nKeep Conservatives United ad: Even worse, Rick Perry’s wife had worked for the company that makes the vaccine.\\n\\nAs evidence, Keep Conservatives United cites a 2000 story in the Austin Chronicle, which notes that in the mid-1990s — when Perry was the state’s agriculture commissioner — his wife, Anita, worked for a PR firm, MEM Hubble Communications Inc., and was tapped to launch a public education campaign for osteoporosis screenings for Merck.\\n\\nWe spoke to Bill Miller, an Austin lobbyist who was a partner of MEM Hubble, and he confirmed that Perry worked on the Merck campaign to promote osteoporosis screenings. But she was not, as the ad implies, a Merck employee. She was a part-time, salaried employee of MEM Hubble Communications, he said, and was assigned the project due to her background in nursing. Merck was not an ongoing client for the firm, and her performance on the project had no bearing on her pay, he said. Anita Perry left the PR company when her husband decided to run for lieutenant governor.\\n\\nAny suggestion that this assignment in the mid-1990s may have influenced Perry’s decision on the HPV vaccine 10 years later is “preposterous,” Miller said. “It’s a crazy, nutty link, irrational and wrong,” he said.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Miller finds it easy to believe Toomey lobbied his former boss. Toomey and Perry served together in the state Legislature, Miller said, and were “fellow travelers” with similar political ideals.\\n\\n“It’s very easy for me to see Mike [Toomey] saying, ‘My client’s got this great vaccine.’… It’s easy for me to see Mike making that pitch,” Miller said.\\n\\nDuring the Republican presidential debate in Orlando, Fla., on Sept. 22, Perry tried to turn the tables on Bachmann’s lobbying claims.\\n\\nPerry, Sept. 22: I got lobbied on this issue. I got lobbied by a 31-year-old young lady who had stage 4 cervical cancer. I spent a lot of time with her. She came by my office She talked to me about this program. I readily admitted we should have had an opt-in, but I don’t know what part of opt out most parents don’t get and the fact is I erred on the side of life and I will always err on the side of life as a governor as a president of the United States.\\n\\nBut that, too, was a stretch. As ABC News pointed out shortly after the debate, Perry didn’t actually meet the woman until after he’d issued his executive order.\\n\\n— Robert Farley',\n",

The location will always be turned on in this SIM card for foreigners. And it cannot be turned off.”\\n\\nThis move is being touted as a national security measure and an innovation that would help tackle trans-border crime, rather than a violation of personal privacy. It is expected to be rolled out in the next six months.\\n\\nSimilar programs in Malaysia and Singapore require registration of SIM cards, but do not require that location services be turned on and available to government authorities. However, following an international meeting of telecommunications regulators from 10 countries in Phuket last week, Takorn claims that Malaysia and Singapore plan to follow suit.\\n\\nWhile the plan raises concerns regarding surveillance and privacy, Takorn was quick to note that only governmental authorities would have the ability to track foreigners through their SIM cards.\\n\\n“We would just facilitate the police. So they could more easily track foreigners who enter the country and commit crimes,” he said, adding that Thai citizens can already be easily tracked by the government. Further, he said, any abuse of the system would be punished. “If a service provider tracks the SIM location without a court order, they would be charged with a criminal offense.”\\n\\nTags:\\n\\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.',\n",

       " '400 radical-left activists were arrested in Stuttgart today as they attempted to prevent the Alternative for Germany (AfD) from starting their annual conference, at which they are to thrash out the contents of their Spring manifesto.\\n\\nScenes of violence were witnessed this morning as members of the anarchist so-called ‘black bloc’ movement clashed with police and assaulted members of the AfD. The protestors received warnings from the police about their behaviour, but after fireworks and lit flares were thrown at officers, they deployed water cannon and pepper spray, reports Kronen Zeitung.\\n\\nAround 1,000 protestors arrived at the Stuttgart convention centre this morning, and were matched by some 1,000 members of the German police. The leftists formed human chains to prevent delegates from entering the centre, effectively delaying the start of the conference by an hour. Police said there were no injuries among the “violent” masked protesters.\\n\\nAs one leftist agitator explained to English language television, “We are united by our conviction that we cannot let the AfD go unchallenged… we will not allow ourselves to be divided and we stand together for a compassionate society”.\\n\\nUnderlining this compassion, protesters threw water at police horses, set fire to tyres, and attacked AfD members with coloured paint.\\n\\nAfD were meeting on the first day of their two day conference to adopt the young parties first national programme — a Spring manifesto. Some 2,400 members were eventually able to enter the hall and enter debates, and vote.\\n\\nWhat is decided upon for the programme will set the future course of action, and direction of travel for the party. Agreed early on in the day was statement by party deputy chairman Beatrix von Storch, former Duchess of Oldenburg, that referring to the political interpretation of the faith “Islam is not part of Germany”, reports Die Welt.\\n\\nParty leader Frauke Petry emphasised that while the party was not Islamophobic, Islam itself was fundementally with Germany’s constitution — the so-called Fundamental Law.\\n\\nAlso discussed was the AfD’s support for German culture, the traditional family, and Germany leaving the Euro single currency. The conference will resume on Sunday.\\n\\nGermany’s AfD has long been the only seriously dissenting voice in the country over the migrant crisis. Having transformed from a niche political movement opposing the Euro single currency and the European Union, it has enjoyed record poll ratings and electoral success in the past 12 months as their anti mass migration policies have caught the the attention of many Germans.\\n\\nAs with many right-wing movements in Europe, AfD’s members have been dismissed as the ‘losers of globalisation’ — societies less educated and less wealthy who have suffered most from mass migration. Yet new research published today by Germany’s mainstream centrist newspaper Die Welt has found that counter the stereotype, AfD supporters are actually among the richest of any politically active group in Germany, and among the best educated.',\n",
       " 'Men have one copy, women have two, but scientists have long puzzled over why the human X chromosome mostly contains genes that are active in a small number of tissues. Now, a team of researchers led by the University of Bath studying the evolution of this X chromosome has discovered why it contains such an unusual mixture of genes.\\n\\nIn humans, males have XY chromosomes, females have XX but only one of these is active, meaning that both sexes only have one active copy of the X chromosome.\\n\\nScientists discovered in 2002 that the X chromosome is unusual because it contains very few of the most important genes needed for basic cell function -- dubbed \"housekeeping\" genes.\\n\\nNow the team, a collaboration between researchers at the University of Bath and Uppsala University, along with members of the FANTOM consortium, have found out why.\\n\\nThey analysed the world\\'s largest compendium of data on gene activity (expression) and looked at how activity on the X chromosome compares with that on other chromosomes.\\n\\nIn a paper published in the journal PLoS Biology, they found that the peak level of gene expression on the X chromosome was under half that of other chromosomes where we have two functioning copies.\\n\\nThe study was led by Professor Laurence Hurst, Director of the Milner Centre for Evolution based in the Department of Biology & Biochemistry at the University of Bath.\\n\\nHe explained: \"Since we showed that X-linked genes tend to be relatively tissue specific over a decade ago, the reason as to why the X chromosome is so odd has bugged me.\\n\\n\"In the end, we have found the answer to be quite simple. Whereas most chromosomes operate in pairs, meaning there are two copies of each gene in every cell, in contrast, we only have one active copy of the X chromosome.\\n\\n\"This means it is not sustainable for highly active genes to be on the X chromosome. Housekeeping genes tend also to be highly active -- they just couldn\\'t survive on the X.\"\\n\\nThe team also identified which genes have moved from the X to the other chromosomes over evolutionary time and those that have gone the other way.\\n\\nThey found that those genes that have migrated onto the X chromosome have much lower peak rates of expression that those making the reverse trip.\\n\\nHurst explained: \"It\\'s a bit like traffic on a busy road -- a highway with two lanes can have a lot more and faster traffic on it than a single lane highway.\\n\\n\"A consequence of having a single chromosome is that, like a one lane road, there will be gene expression traffic tailbacks on the X chromosome especially at peak periods. Hence our X chromosome will not be a tolerable home for the most highly expressed genes.\"\\n\\nThe study also found that, unlike those found on other chromosomes, the more highly expressed genes on the X chromosome were less prone to increasing their expression level over evolutionary time.\\n\\nSenior author Lukasz Huminiecki of Uppsala University commented: \"This fits with our traffic analogy as, if there is a tailback, it is hard to increase the speed of the cars on the road.\"\\n\\nThe team also found that there has been an evolutionary exodus of genes that are highly expressed at peak times from the X chromosome, suggesting these genes cannot function on this chromosome due to the fact there is only one active copy. For example, genes that are active in tissues such as the pancreas which secretes a large number of protein hormones, are noticeably rare on the X chromosome compared to the non-sex chromosomes.\\n\\nHuminiecki added: \"With the remarkable resolution of the FANTOM gene expression data, we have shown that none of the prior explanations resolves fully the mysteries of the X. For example, if you exclude genes expressed in tissues that are found in only one sex or are involved in making sperm, the remainder still have relatively tissue-specific activity.\"\\n\\nThe work has implications for new medical treatments such as gene therapy as it suggests that replacement genes should not be inserted into the X chromosome because traffic tailbacks may limit the extent to which the gene can be expressed.',\n",
       " \"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Pinterest Print Mail Flipboard\\n\\nRepublicans who have spent the past few years doing everything they possibly can to obstruct and repeal the Affordable Care Act felt pretty good about themselves Tuesday morning. In a confusing decision that is likely to be overturned by the full D.C. Circuit Court, the D.C. Court of Appeals ruled that anyone who has purchased health insurance on the federal healthcare exchange is ineligible for subsidies available through the health care law. Based on ambiguous wording in one section of the law, the two conservative judges on the panel decided that only those who went through a state-run exchange could receive tax credits and other subsidies to help offset the cost of insurance premiums.\\n\\nOf course, just hours later, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals came back with a ruling in a separate but similar case that was completely opposite, stating that the Obama Administration has the legal ability to issue subsidies based on its interpretation of the law. The morning’s national headlines that blared out that Obamacare was possibly dead due to this ‘shocking’ ruling were later muted to reflect the ‘mixed’ and ‘contradicting’ rulings by the two courts. What was supposed to be a huge victory for ACA’s opponents turned out to be a dud. The D.C. Court of Appeals ruling will likely be tossed by the full D.C. Circuit Court while the Fourth Circuit Court’s decision is consistent with other recent court decisions on cases of this nature.\\n\\nUnfortunately for some Republicans, they jumped the gun on their celebrations over the impending death of Obamacare. Not realizing there was a similar case being with a decision pending in the Fourth Circuit Court, Washington Republicans and conservative pundits released statements, took to Twitter or blathered on the radio about the “historic” ruling made by the D.C. court. In the timeframe between the announcement of the two decisions, conservatives frankly made fools of themselves as they prematurely gloated.\\n\\nFirst off, we have Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who has been one of the most vocal opponents of the health care law since he was elected in 2012. In fact, he even staged a government shutdown last year due to his opposition to Obamacare. Immediately after the D.C. court’s ruling came out, Cruz released the following statement:\\n\\n“The D.C. Circuit’s decision today in Halbig v. Burwell is a repudiation of Obamacare and all the lawlessness that has come with it,” said Sen. Cruz. “The Obama Administration, through the Internal Revenue Service, has attempted to dispense revenues to the states without proper congressional authorization, robbing Congress of its constitutionally-provided power of the purse. This decision restores power to Congress and to the people and if properly enforced, should shield citizens from Obamacare’s insidious penalties, mandates, and subsidies. This is a significant victory for the American people and the rule of law, but we must not rest. Americans will continue to lose jobs, pay higher premiums, and receive fewer healthcare choices because of this disastrous law. Every last word of Obamacare must be repealed to restore jobs, growth, and opportunity in our country.”\\n\\nSpeaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) also got in on the action. Boehner has held out hope that Republicans’ objections to the Affordable Care Act will pay big dividends for them in the 2014 midterms. The Speaker also used his statement on Tuesday to push his Quixotic lawsuit against the Obama Administration.\\n\\n“For the second time in a month, the courts have ruled against the president’s unilateral actions regarding ObamaCare. The president has demonstrated he believes he has the power to make his own laws. That’s not the way our system of government was designed to work. That’s why the House will act next week to authorize a lawsuit to uphold the rule of law and protect our Constitution. This isn’t about Republicans versus Democrats; it’s about the Constitution versus unconstitutional and unilateral actions by the Executive Branch, and protecting our democracy. “Today’s ruling is also further proof that President Obama’s health care law is completely unworkable. It cannot be fixed. The American people recognize that ObamaCare is hurting our economy and making it harder for small businesses to hire, and that’s why Republicans remain committed to repealing the law and replacing it with solutions that will lower health care costs and protect American jobs.”\\n\\nThe Speaker also sent out a couple of tweets to express his approval over the court’s ruling.\\n\\nFor the second time in a month, the courts have ruled against the president’s unilateral actions regarding #ObamaCare http://t.co/IPk4RdKl42 — Speaker John Boehner (@SpeakerBoehner) July 22, 2014\\n\\nToday’s ruling is further proof that #ObamaCare is completely unworkable. It cannot be fixed. http://t.co/IPk4RdKl42 — Speaker John Boehner (@SpeakerBoehner) July 22, 2014\\n\\nNot to be outdone by Republican lawmakers, conservative blowhard Rush Limbaugh spent a good portion of his program on Tuesday declaring Obamacare dead.\\n\\nLIMBAUGH: So everybody who has purchased Obamacare through HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange, essentially, and has gotten a subsidy is now disallowed. That’s it, in a nutshell. And that’s the law. This is a huge day, at least temporarily, for the rule of law. Folks, the law couldn’t be plainer. And this poor writer at the LA Time (imitating writer), “It’s just a glitch in the wording. Come on, people, it’s just a glitch.” Glitch in the wording? The law is the law and Obama hasn’t liked it 71 different times and has changed it, in order to protect Democrats at election time. Everybody that’s paying scant attention knows this. It’s a huge day for the rule of law here. The DC circuit, 2-1 vote — now, there are a number of different ways this can go. It’s by no means over. The losing side, in this case the Regime, can ask for an en banc ruling or hearing. That means ask for every judge to hear and vote on the case at the DC circuit which would — I don’t know how many judges are on that circuit, usually 12, 13, it could be up to 20, I just don’t know the number. But every case starts with a three-judge panel, and then the losers can ask for en banc, and then after that you go to the Supreme Court, if they take it. And then if the Supreme Court takes the — if this ruling holds, if they go en banc and it holds will this, and then if the Supreme Court decides to take it then we’re back with Chief Justice Roberts and will he want to bail Obama out a second time. The Supreme Court could also decide, “Nope, we’re not gonna hear it. Lower court ruling, DC circuit ruling stands, we’re outta here.” There’s any number of things that can happen, but right now all of the people that got subsidies at HealthCare.gov are essentially in violation of the law.\\n\\nOnce the Fourth Circuit Court’s ruling hit Tuesday afternoon — crickets.

       " 'What’s propelling China’s industrial robot revolution\\n\\nXi Jinping, China’s President, last year called for an “industrial robot revolution.” Since then China has created policies giving value added tax refunds and subsidies to companies making robots, and robot user companies can qualify for tax breaks.\\n\\nThe Financial Times reported that analysts are forecasting the payback period for industrial robots with a 10 yr life cycle is 1.7 yrs in 2015, down from 11.8 yrs in 2008 and will likely shorten again to 1.3 years in 2016.\\n\\nThe prospect of being able to pay off the cost of a robot in slightly more than a year, Goldman Sachs says, has brought industrial automation to within the reach of China’s millions of small and medium-sized manufacturers, creating the conditions for a productivity surge.\\n\\nThese two factors (the mandate to use robots and the lower payback metrics) combined with “shrinkage in China’s working age population and the numbers of workers available for production line work” are likely to propel the continued deployment of robots in China and contribute to the huge surge in robot sales in China (as can be seen in the FT chart) and International Federation of Robotics (IFR) statistical data. Further contributing to China’s labor shortage is an elevation in levels of education attainment in young working age adults, causing them to seek non-factory work.\\n\\nTwo recent research reports by ResearchinChina and Huidian Research attest to China’s growing need for robotics across the manufacturing spectrum, from the auto industry to craft breweries. These reports, and others, forecast that by 2017, more industrial robots will be operating in China’s production plants than in the EU or North America. It is expected that global industrial robot sales will grow from 200,000 in 2014 to 400,000 by 2017!\\n\\nAt next week’s big CIROS Show in Shanghai, on July 7th, a joint IFR-CRIA (Chinese Robotics Industry Alliance) roundtable discussion on Innovation on Robot Applications, will also provide a forum where the IFR will present their preliminary industrial robotics recap for the year 2014, which will confirm the radical growth in China’s robot population. The IFR’s annual World Robotics Industrial Robots report for 2015 covering 2014 results will be released this fall and is a worthwhile purchase.\\n\\nIn other news, a recent message to shareholders, Foxconn’s chairman said that he plans to reduce Foxconn’s pressing need to recruit, hire and train up to 30% of their 1.3 million workforce by replacing dull, dirty, ergonomically stressful, and dangerous tasks with robots within the next few years. Displaced workers will be retrained for higher-level jobs.',\n",
       " \"In puppy classes, we help build puppies' confidence and experience by giving them opportunities to interact with different obstacles and surfaces.\\n\\nElla was really scared of the tunnel at first, and she wouldn't go through it during her first exposure. So we just let her examine it during that session and rewarded her for checking it out. When we tried again two weeks later, we were able to build on that first experience and lure her through it with some yummy treats. Experiences like this can help teach a dog to be more confident around new and strange things.\\n\\nIt seems that more and more dog owners are hearing about the importance of socializing dogs when they're young, but until every single one hears the message, we need to keep hammering it home. There is also a ton of new research coming out all the time both about its value and about when and how to do it, so even if you're an experienced dog person, you might be surprised by some of the new guidelines we're hearing from behavioral experts. This week, I'll tackle socialization basics, but next week , I'll look at some of the new research around the timing and methodology of socialization.For the purpose of this discussion, I'm definingas the process of exposing a puppy to positive experiences with all kinds of different people, dogs, and situations during the crucial developmental periods of preadolescence (8-16 weeks of age). Dog trainers and behaviorists recommend it because extensive research and experience have taught us that during a crucial period when puppies are young, they tend to be more accepting of new sounds, sights, smells, and people. During this period, they are also more impressionable than older dogs, so the lessons learned stick very deeply.Older dogs can obviously still learn to accept new and potentially scary things, but the process typically takes longer and can be more difficult, so part of laying the foundations of a lifelong relationship with a well-balanced dog is giving a puppy lots of positive, mellow experiences with the kinds of things he'll need to be comfortable with throughout his life.That means puppies need to meet people of all kinds of shapes, sizes, dress codes, faces, voices, and behaviors. An unsocialized adult dog might be fine with his family, but outside that zone of safety, he's more likely to be fearful or overexcited around unfamiliar things like glasses, hats, or beards if he's never learned that they aren't signs of danger. New stimuli can be very intimidating to dogs, and if they react with fear, that can lead to more than just an unhappy experience. Fear and other kinds of overstimulation can cause issues ranging from common problems like an inability to focus around distractions all the way to very dangerous behaviors, like running off or even fear biting.Just a few weeks ago, I wrote about how context is king in a dog's world, and socialization can be understood as an extension of that concept. Any unfamiliar aspect of a situation can mean that the dog does not know what to do to create safety for himself. In the house, with people he knows, he has learned what he can do to feel safe, like where he can go to hide or what behaviors he can offer that get him positive attention, food, toys, and games.But when the situation changes, even a little, the dog might not even know that the world is still safe and that humans are still going to be kind and predictable. Dogs are masterful at a lot of things, but they are not good at generalizing or inferring. As humans, we are so good at those things that we naturally take them for granted. For example, if your dog has never met a man with a beard, he may not be able to generalize that a man with a beard will behave in a similar fashion to all the men he's met without beards. To us, that's incredibly illogical. But to a dog, a man with a beard might seem like aIt's like if you turned a corner and were confronted by a bear wearing a tuxedo.That doesn't mean you can just throw a puppy into any old situation and expect him to be cool with it. The flip side of the socialization period is that it's also a period in which traumatic experiences will stick deep, so if you create a situation in which your pup is freaking out and you force him to keep confronting something he's afraid of, you can create a lifetime fear of that kind of situation. While you should be working hard to socialize your pup, you should be working equally hard to make sure that each experience is mellow and rewarding, and you never want to teach him that he can't escape a scary situation. If your pup shows signs of stress with what you're working on, respect that, even if the anxiety is totally illogical. Respect that fear, tone down the experience, and dial up the rewards.So, for example, when a puppy sees his first adult in a ball cap, he should get a yummy treat, especially if it seemed to make him nervous. If he tries to get away from a new thing, like a trash can, even if his fear is completely unfounded, let him. Teach him that if he's upset, he'll be able to get away and then inspect the thing at his own pace, not that you'll drag him closer or force him into things. Teach him that any bravery he shows will be rewarded with calm praise and a treat or toy.By sixteen weeks of age, a puppy should have done as much of the following as possible: met a hundred different calm, friendly people; played with a dozen different friendly, healthy, vaccinated dogs; walked on a dozen different kinds of surfaces; seen some of the local wildlife; and had a whole variety of other experiences you can come up with that mimic the kinds of things he'll run into in the life you're planning for him. Here's a printable checklist in PDF format that you can use to track your progress and make sure you haven't missed any of the common items people overlook when socializing their puppies. The checklist offers overall goals, like meeting 100 friendly strangers and walking on 15 different surfaces, and it also gives lots of specific items and a way to keep a record of how well the experience went so you know what kinds of things you may want to revisit.One last thing: if you're reading this and your dog is older than sixteen weeks, that doesn't mean that the work of socialization is done. Maybe you didn't do everything the experts recommend before sixteen weeks, or maybe you have an adult dog with an unknown history. It doesn't matter now; socialization is a lifelong process. The early puppy window is really helpful, but every positive experience your dog has with a new thing is still socializing that dog to be more confident and stable. And if you socialized your pup by the book through week sixteen, then pat yourself on the back, but still remember that your work isn't over. You can still socialize a dog after he grows up, and early socialization isn't the only thing a dog needs. If you want a calm, confident companion dog, that's something you create opportunities to encourage wherever you can through a dog's whole life.\",\n",
       " \"President Obama is on a diplomatic tour of Asia this week and one of his top priorities is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade agreement that includes restrictive copyright enforcement measures that pose a huge threat to users’ rights and a free and open Internet. In particular, he's seeking to resolve some major policy disagreements with Japan and Malaysia—the two countries that have maintained resistance against some provisions in the TPP involving agriculture and other commodities. Despite some reports of movement on some of the most controversial topics during meetings between Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Abe, it seems that the TPP is still effectively at a standstill.\\n\\nAs negotiations continue to be shrouded in secrecy, the Pacific trade deal faces mass opposition both inside and outside of the U.S., and reports say little progress has been made for many months. State leaders and trade delegates have held dozens of closed-door meetings to discuss possible trade-offs and concessions over various tariffs and regulations, including some of the most controversial copyright enforcement provisions in the Intellectual Property chapter. Based upon the leaked text published by Wikileaks in November, several countries are resisting the extreme U.S. proposals on Digital Rights Management (DRM) and Internet Service Provider (ISP) liability.\\n\\nThis action has been archived.\\n\\nThis pushback is great news, and it comes thanks in large part to users around the world contacting their lawmakers and asking them to question and oppose TPP's secretive corporate-driven agenda. A new campaign this week called Stop the Secrecy collected users' petition signatures and messages about the TPP from various public interest groups; the final tally came out to over 2.8 million actions that have been taken over the last two years. The campaigners are projecting their message to “stop the secrecy” on U.S. capitol buildings. The aim is to get lawmakers and trade delegates to realize that if the agreement progresses, thousands of these users will be ready to stop it again in its tracks.\\n\\nFollowing massive blows to the Fast Track bill introduced in January, many Senators are maintaining their stiff opposition against handing over trade authority to the White House. Under Fast Track, also known as Trade Promotion Authority, lawmakers would be limited to an up-or-down vote, and shirk their responsibility to hold proper hearings on its provisions. Republican Senator Roger Wicker has openly stated that he “couldn't be less optimistic” about any progress being achieved during Obama's trip to Asia. In an op-ed published this week in the LA Times, three Democratic Representatives reiterated their strong criticism of the TPP, advising that no one should “blindly endorse” this agreement. In November, the New York Times had done precisely that, but they too have suddenly changed their tune—publishing an editorial this week that expressed their heavy doubts over TPP's objectives. They correctly questioned the administration's secrecy over the negotiations and wrote that the “Obama administration also needs to do much more to counter the demands of corporations with those of the public interest.”\\n\\nAs long as trade agreements include digital copyright enforcement provisions however, it seems the content industry will do everything in its power to expand restrictive, anti-user policies. In March, we noticed that the Obama administration appointed a former SOPA lobbyist to join the team of negotiators working on the TPP. Now the revolving door continues to swing, yet again. The Motion Picture Association of America has hired Stan McCoy who, up until recently, had been the Chief Intellectual Property Negotiator for the TPP for five years. Despite the stalled TPP talks, the MPAA is forging ahead—still very interested in securing their copyright interests in international trade agreements.\\n\\nWhile the President and his U.S. Trade Rep, Michael Froman, are determined to push the agreement forward, reports say TPP countries are not convinced that Obama will be able to rally the political support needed to pass a Fast Track bill. If it doesn't grant Fast Track authority, Congress can pick apart and question every aspect of this sprawling trade agreement. TPP countries are unwilling to make potentially harmful concessions to the U.S. if there’s a chance the agreement would simply be unraveled by Congress once signed. The conclusion of TPP therefore seems increasingly contingent upon the Obama administration getting Fast Track authority, and so far Congress has shown no indication that they're willing to give it to them.\\n\\nSince Obama missed his self-imposed deadline to conclude the talks last December, there has not been a publicly stated timeframe for the agreement's conclusion. This means the TPP could remain in this secretive, political limbo for months. On the other hand, the enhanced secrecy of the talks amongst trade delegates could lead to a situation where a concluded deal suddenly emerges, but that could only happen if the countries are somehow able to overcome some major controversial issues.\\n\\nAs others have pointed out, the Obama administration only has itself to blame for this mess. By listening to corporate demands above all else, it has alienated itself from its own political party, public interest groups, and most of all, the people whose interests it is supposedly meant to represent. Unless the U.S. trade rep radically changes its approach to this agreement—to make the negotiations truly transparent and incorporate substantive input from the public, for starters—it seems the President is going to be stuck defending a bad deal and a bad process. As long as the TPP remains a secretive process driven entirely by narrow interests, we'll do everything we can to make sure it goes nowhere.\",\n",

Amid the hushed Royal Coronation-style BBC coverage of the “handover” from Cameron to Theresa May last night, complete with soft-focus montages and music, what the broadcasters seemed to miss was: this is a change of government.\\n\\nWith Johnson, Fox and Davies in senior foreign-facing positions in cabinet, this is the most right wing Conservative government since Thatcher’s in 1990. True, it was ushered in using the words “working class” and “social justice” but anybody who thinks these terms are the preserve only of the left has not studied 20th century history.\\n\\nBrexit will fail not just because it was done without a plan; not just because the incoming cabinet will be divided over even the most basic question — in or out of the single market. It will fail because the EU27 will make it fail. The most powerful countries in Europe, and its political elite, need to make it fail; the least powerful, for different reasons, need to make it painful.\\n\\nAll the pro-Leave campaign’s bravado about major European exporters being “forced to do a deal” will evaporate. The UK will enter recession. It will be faced with the need to take counter-cyclical action — tax cuts for business to boost inward investment — that will be seen as unfair competition by the 27.\\n\\nIt will be foreced to save its steel industry with state aid technically illegal in Europe. And when it finally makes some kind of half-hearted bid for access to the single market, the May administration will be laughed out of court — and more importantly out of the European Parliament — unless it agrees in principle to the free movement of labour.\\n\\nThe Commission, the Council and the Parliament will each point out: the May government has no mandate from the people. It cannot prevent the overturn of any deal by a government of the left and centre-left. David Davies’ promise today that Britain “will leave the EU in December 2018” will ring as hollow then as Osborne’s punishment budget does now.\\n\\nFaced with this, what should the progressive half of British politics do?\\n\\nFirst, stop dreaming about sabotaging the referendum result via legal means or parliamentary manouvres. The Tory Brexit, if it fails, must be allowed to fail under the leadership of those who called for it.\\n\\nHowever, Labour challenger Owen Smith’s call for a second referendum or election, with the results of negotiation as the issue, is worth considering. I would add to it the need for an early election to approve the negotiating stance.\\n\\nThis is not a question of “reopening the Brexit vote” but allowing democracy to work through two stages of the Brexit process.\\n\\nFirst, May’s government must be allowed to design its negotiating offer. This must be dragged out into the limelight by the opposition: there can be no more secret diplomacy of the kind Cameron woefully indulged in February/March.\\n\\nNext we have to see the EU27’s response. And more: right now Norway is said to oppose British membership of the EEA so even that route may not be open as a starting point.\\n\\nOnce we have an offer and a response there should be an election. In that election all parties favouring an immediate application to join the EEA should form an electoral alliance.\\n\\nWhoever wins should carry out the negotiation and at the end, if the outcome is close to what the governing party (or coalition) stood on, it should be ratified; if not it should be put to a new referendum: take the deal on offer; remain in the EU; or walk away and trust to the WTO.\\n\\nI have always favoured this process, and argued for it in February, once it was clear that neither Labour nor the government was prepared to spell out a Brexit contingency plan.\\n\\nThe UK should immediately signal its intent to join the EEA, despite the fact that the referendum result reveals there is not enough popular consent for freedom of movement.\\n\\nIf a Labour-led coalition was leading the negotiations, it should accept freedom of movement in principle, but :\\n\\n(a) Ask for a Europe-wide labour market strategy to even out minimum wage rates; welfare benefit rates and reverse anti-union laws that encourage “posting” of workers to undercut wages\\n\\n(b) Implement national labour market strategy designed to deter migrant-only workforces and cheap labour exploitation; to redirect EU migration towards resilient multicultural cities, not small towns with scarce resources; and massively empower the unions to fight slave labour practices, if possible via the reintroduction of the “closed shop” — ie making union membership compulsory. All these are legitimate labour market reforms and could be compatible with free movement.\\n\\n(c) Ask for an “emergency brake” to be applied — as is possible under EEA rules — until numbers stabilise. A temporary EU migrant quota could be set by an independent body which the government could set up to measure and predict labour demand. Any emergency brake request could only be temporary howeer and its purpose should be to restore popular consent for freedom of movement.\\n\\n(d) A progressive government should of course guarantee — unlike May’s administration — the right to remain of every existing EU-born person currently in the UK.\\n\\nThere is no guarantee Europe will agree even to this, but it constitutes a plan, and it provides a focus for opposition. It may well annoy some people in Labour heartlands so badly that they leave and join UKIP — but the alternative, to ditch any attempt to remain in the EEA, is economic suicide for Britain and a disaster for organised labour. As a “big Singapore”, a neo-Thatcherite Britain completely adrift from the Single Market could only survive by serious attacks on rights and living standards.\\n\\nBecause May’s government is full of people who played to the racist gallery in the Brexit vote, nodding and winking to the xenophobes of UKIP, it cannot do any kind of deal that includes even the possibility of free movement without splitting.\\n\\nThis is a massive political opportunity for the opposition parties.\\n\\nThe PLP rebels, whose position looks less and less tenable after they failed to circumvent Labour Party democracy, need to find a way to climb down. Their revolt was designed to paralyse HM Opposition and that’s what it is doing — at a time of national crisis.\\n\\nThere is a sickening level of abuse flying around on all sides, which will tear Labour apart unless the coup ends. On top of which, the suspension of internal Labour Party branch meetings will paralyse the party at exactly the point it needs to be an institution promoting stability inside very nervous and fractious communities.\\n\\nAlready Momentum, Corbyn’s grassroots organisation, is having to function in lieu of local party bodies; many of its local meetings are currently 2x or 3x bigger than the last official Labour ones. If this arrangement solidifies, and the two sides begin to meet separately at ward and constituency level, then a historic and major institution for the working class is half-gone.\\n\\nI’ve said, as early as February, that the Tory crisis demands the Labour party function as a coalition; the centre left accepting the left’s right to lead; the Corbyn camp ceding control of some policy areas to bring talented former ministers back onto the front bench.\\n\\nOnce parliament rises, next week, the physical separation of the two camps will be more or less complete — they’ll have no need to meet each other except at hustings.\\n\\nLabour under Corbyn can and must become a social movement to fight what’s being prepared in the Cabinet Room of 10 Downing Street — an onslaught on liberties and living standards to make the working class pay the price of Brexit.\\n\\nOwen Smith’s entry into the leadership race shows the left and centre left of Labour have a lot in common, and could easily collaborate with each other. I’m backing Corbyn, but its clear Smith could easily serve in a Corbyn-led shadow cabinet and vice-versa. We should work overtime to make sure that, if they can’t back down, a route is found to allow Smith and his supporters to co-exist inside a Corbyn-led PLP.\\n\\nThe real problem is the Blairite right: it has all along planned and pushed for the coup and used the Murdoch press to make it happen. They unleashed bullying, coercion, threats, trolling and personal insults against powerless individual members — and then ran to the media when, predictably and regrettably, the same stuff came back at them.\\n\\nNow the toxic atmosphere has attracted all kinds of seriously pernicious people: the egg-people of Twitter, making anonymous threats of violence, rape and death against people on all sides. If anybody from the Corbyn camp is identified as perpetrating this stuff they should not just be out of the party but prosecuted. Ditto for the other side.\\n\\nHowever, the outrage of the membership is justified, as long as it is civilly expressed. We’re facing the sabotage of effective opposition, designed to force an elected leader to resign, ultimately by people representing the interests of the 1%.\\n\\nIf the civil war inside the Labour Party can’t be stopped it must be won — but calmly, using democratic means, rational persuasion and a disciplined political campaign.',\n",

       " 'May 22, 2017\\n\\nIn the middle of a stormy legislative session, which is careening to a close at midnight tonight, Minnesota’s Governor, Mark Dayton, has thrown two clear lifelines to public education supporters across the state.\\n\\nFirst, on May 18, Dayton took a bold swipe at a shifty, right-wing aligned overhaul of the state’s teacher licensure laws, called HF 140. Citing concern over the proposal’s lack of dedicated funding support, as well as doubts over the tiered approach to licensure offered in the bill, Dayton vetoed HF 140 and sent those supporting it back to the drawing board. “The move came as a shock to Republicans,” the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported, “who argued the bill was a bipartisan improvement to the often-criticized current system.”\\n\\nThe Republicans–at least, the publicly identified ones–weren’t the only ones shocked over Dayton’s rejection of the teacher licensure bill. A group of Minneapolis-based education reform interests, many of whom share an address on University Avenue, also expressed dismay with Dayton’s decision.\\n\\nCalling themselves a “coaltion,“ groups such as Minnesota Comeback, Ed Allies, Teach for America, Students for Education Reform and Hiawatha Academies (a local charter school chain) sent a letter to Dayton on May 17, urging him to support HF 140. SIgning this bill into law, they promised, would help “countless teachers find a pathway into Minnesota classroom.” (They can’t do so now because of Minnesota’s cumbersome licensure laws, the argument goes.)\\n\\nWhat’s more, the letter asserts, HF 140 would allow “school leaders to recruit and retain the best educators for our students.” How so? By having a tiered licensure system, offering several levels of qualifications to work in a school as a teacher. What caught Dayton’s eye was the proposed “Tier 3,” where a candidate could have, in essence, an unlimited, provisional teaching license. (Who would hire these teachers? Blake? Breck? Majority white public schools?)\\n\\nThis provision would have provided a fast track to a disposable, non-union teaching force–perfect for staffing the kind of “high performing, innovative” charter schools favored by education reformers. And, it ties HF 140 right back to its beginnings as a model ALEC bill. In 2006, ALEC–a “pay to play operation” that writes legislation for state and federal elected officials on behalf of corporations and conservative, pro-privatization causes such as Right to Work and Stand Your Ground laws–passed its own teacher licensure law, called the “Alternative Certification Act.”\\n\\nWhat does ALEC want? A less skilled, less empowered, non-unionized workforce, preferably in charter schools rather than unionized public schools (charter schools can operate with less public oversight, and a more malleable teaching force may be more willing to experiment with personalized learning and other investor-friendly ventures.) ALEC has been heavily funded by the billion dollar Walton Family Foundation, set up by the folks behind Wal-Mart.\\n\\nGuess who else is heavily funded by the Walton Foundation? Nearly everybody on the coalition letter sent to Governor Mark Dayton. For example:\\n\\nMinnesota Comeback (the group determined to bring “30,000 rigorous, relevant seats” to Minneapolis)\\n\\nGreat MN Schools (the fund behind Minnesota Comeback)\\n\\nlobbying arm Ed Allies (theaffiliated with Minnesota Comeback)\\n\\nEducators 4 Excellence (an offshoot of Teach for America, designed to supplant teachers unions and promote neoliberal education policies around testing and teacher evaluations)\\n\\nStudents for Education Reform (spurred by hedge funds)\\n\\nTeach for America ((which seeks to stay alive by serving as an alternative licensure operation, staffing primarily charter schools)\\n\\nthe Wildflower Foundation Hiawatha Academies (run by Eli Kramer, whose brother Matt, a former TFA executive, also signed this letter through his new group,\\n\\nProdeo Academy (local charter school prized by reformers)\\n\\nreceived money many charter schools in MN KIPP MN (funded in part by the Minneapolis Foundation, which hasfrom the Walton Family Foundation, as have\\n\\nThese groups often sell themselves as being all about equity and improved opportunity for marginalized communities. It’s curious to note, then, that both the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce and the Minnesota Business Partnership–two pro-business, anti-tax lobbying giants–are also listed as part of this education reform coalition.\\n\\nFlashback! In 2012, the Minnesota Business Partnership stood solidly behind another ALEC-written law, the Voter ID bill that sought to limit voting rights in Minnesota. This bill was described as an “intentional effort to reduce the voting rolls in order to help corporate conservatives further expand their wealth and power.”\\n\\nThis leads to another sketchy education policy provision recently axed by Governor Dayton. In the wee hours of budget negotiations last night, Republican state senator Roger Chamberlain, listed here as a member of ALEC’s “Public Safety and Elections Taskforce,” acknowledged that the ALEC-sprung measure–neovouchers, or “tax credit scholarships”–had been taken out of the omnibus tax bill.\\n\\nFirst, St. Paul Pioneer Press reporter Rachel Stassen-Berger made this announcement:\\n\\nSen. Chamberlain tells me the opportunity scholarships, which Dayton called vouchers, are no longer in the tax bill. #mnleg — R. Stassen-Berger (@RachelSB) May 21, 2017\\n\\nChamberlain responded with a terse Twitter statement of his own, declaring that “kids lose again.” Kids lose the opportunity, I guess, to be pawns in a game funded by wealthy ideologues like the Waltons, Betsy DeVos and ALEC’s corporate supporters–all of whom have stood emphatically behind the “disruptive” effects of vouchers (using public money for private schools that do not have to accept “all kids.”)\\n\\nDayton has skillfully blocked these two attempts to weaken Minnesota’s stance as a pro-public school state. It couldn’t have been easy, since there are real issues wrapped up in the attempts to reshape teacher licensure laws, and elite forces are skilled at creating or using a crisis (teacher shortage!) to push through their preferred solutions.\\n\\nNow, before midnight strikes tonight, Dayton faces a very heavy lift: getting ALEC-minded legislators and lobbyists to agree to fund Minnesota’s public schools. Without an investment from the state, public education in Minnesota will remain under further attack from right-wing ideologues and their well-funded agendas.\\n\\nLike my work, even though it might be just a “fringy” blog?

We are in a wait and see mode on how the state will regulate sales and possibly use in public places.”\\n\\nArticle continues after ad Advertisement\\n\\nGarnett’s stance came the same day Amendment 64 proponents called on other prosecutors, particularly Denver DA Mitch Morrisey, to follow his lead.\\n\\n“A strong majority of Coloradans made it clear that they do not believe adults should be made criminals for possessing small amounts of marijuana,” said Mason Tvert, a proponent of Amendment 64. “Colorado prosecutors can follow the will of the voters by dropping these cases today and announcing they are no longer taking on new ones. We applaud District Attorney Garnett for respecting the will of the voters, and we hope his colleagues across the state will follow his lead,” Tvert said. “We do not see why District Attorney Morrissey or any other prosecutor would want to continue seeking criminal penalties for conduct that will be legal in the next month or so.”\\n\\nProsecutors in some Washington counties, where marijuana legalization also passed, have also dropped pending pot possession prosecutions.\\n\\nTags: Amendment 64',\n",
       " 'Marty Walsh Is Not Happy About the New Boston 2024 Book\\n\\nHe called the authors, including former No Boston Olympics co-chair Chris Dempsey, \"opportunists.\"\\n\\nGet a compelling long read and must-have lifestyle tips in your inbox every Sunday morning — great with coffee!\\n\\nCount Mayor Marty Walsh among those who are less than enthused about a new book about the failed Boston Olympics bid coming out this week.\\n\\nWritten by former No Boston Olympics co-chair Chris Dempsey and Smith College professor Andrew Zimbalist, and published by University Press of New England, No Boston Olympics: How and Why Smart Cities Are Passing on the Torch uses an exhaustive insider account of the rise and fall of the Boston 2024 bid as a case study examining why more and more cities are resisting the siren’s call of the Games.\\n\\nIn an interview with NBC Boston’s Alison King this week, Walsh dismissed Dempsey and Zimbalist as “a couple of opportunists.”\\n\\n“I’d like to know where the profits of the book are going to go,” he said. “There are some falsehoods in that book that they wrote about. It seems to be that they’re doing it for their own personal gain, which is fine, but I think that we could look at the Olympics as a positive that Boston was chosen. There was no money spent. We got out of the bid. I wasn’t going to sign that agreement.”\\n\\nWhile there was never any one line item for Boston 2024 in the budget, city resources and manpower were dedicated to the proposal. And time is money—that’s more or less the reason that City Hall gave when it charged activist Jonathan Cohn more than $1,000 for City Hall’s emails with Boston 2024 organizers. (Never mind that the Brattle Report, detailing what happened with the bid, cost state taxpayers as much as $250,000.)\\n\\nAnd then there’s that pesky “agreement.” In an October 2014 letter to the United States Olympic Committee, as well as the legally binding joinder agreement signed in February 2015—revised after the previous version included a gag order forbidding city employees from speaking ill of the bid—Walsh committed to signing the Host City Contract “unedited,” and that the City of Boston “will agree to the terms, without reservation.” That contract included the taxpayer guarantee.\\n\\nWalsh’s crusade against the book continued in an interview with WGBH’s Jim Braude Tuesday night: “They immediately took a position against the Olympics without having a conversation with me or anyone on the Olympic side to see what it meant.” But Boston 2024 chairman John Fish agreed to meet with No Boston Olympics in 2014, only to cancel the night before and never reschedule. Though Walsh promised in November 2014 to hold public meetings on the bid before the year’s end, this did not happen, either.\\n\\n“It is disappointing to be called an ‘opportunist’ for chronicling the story of how regular Bostonians successfully opposed an ill-conceived Olympic bid that would have set back our region and stuck taxpayers with a multibillion dollar bill,” says Dempsey, now the executive director of Transportation for Massachusetts. “Professor Zimbalist and I wrote the book because we felt there were lessons in Boston 2024 for leaders in cities worldwide. Here at home, I trust that as the bid fades into the past we’ll all find common ground to move Massachusetts forward.”\\n\\nThe Boston 2024 debacle likely isn’t something Walsh wants back in the news cycle as he prepares for his first reelection bid. His challenger, Tito Jackson, was a vocal opponent of Boston 2024, and has since made reference to the failed bid on the campaign trail.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions.\\n\\nEarlier this week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department is going to expand asset forfeiture – a badly flawed policy under which the government is allowed to confiscate the property of people suspected of a crime, even in many cases where they are never charged, much less convicted. The new policy would reinstate and expand a program under which the federal government “adopts” forfeiture cases initiated by state and local law enforcement agencies, and then lets the state agency keep 80% of the proceeds through “equitable sharing,” thus creating a strong financial incentive to pursue forfeiture cases.\\n\\nSessions claims that the policy is needed to ensure that criminals are not “allowed to keep the proceeds of their crime.” In reality, however, some 87% of federal asset forfeiture cases do not require any prosecution or conviction. Often, authorities seize property they think might potentially have been used to commit a crime, even if the owner did not violate any criminal laws himself. The opportunity to profit from the sale of forfeited assets creates perverse incentives to seize as much as possible.\\n\\nIn recent years, asset forfeiture has attracted widespread opposition on both right and left, because it undermines property rights, harms numerous innocent people, and especially tends to victimize the poor and minorities, who often lack the resources to contest seizures. In many states, owners have little opportunity to contest seizures, thereby enabling authorities to hold on to their seized property for months or even years, without so much as a hearing. In my view, such practices violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but the Supreme Court has yet to rule on the issue. Justice Clarence Thomas also raised serious concerns about the constitutionality of asset forfeitures in a recent opinion. Sessions’ expansion of asset forfeitures has already inspired a petition asking Congress to reverse it, joined by groups as varied as the ACLU, the libertarian Institute for Justice (which has long been active on this issue), the NAACP, Americans for Prosperity, the Goldwater Institute, and others.\\n\\nIn 2015, Obama attorney general Eric Holder instituted a new policy significantly curtailing, though by no means abolishing, equitable sharing. Sessions has now reversed Holder’s policy, and fully reinstated equitable sharing.\\n\\nThe situation might potentially get even worse than it was in the pre-Holder era, because Sessions also seeks to expand the federal role in the War on Drugs, including even ramping up marijuana prosecutions in states that have legalized it. The War on Drugs is a major source of federally-sponsored asset forfeitures. The restoration of equitable sharing, combined with greater aggressiveness in the War on Drugs, will create many more opportunities for asset forfeitures, and ensure the victimization of many more innocent people.\\n\\nIn fairness, Sessions’ policy includes a few modest safeguards for property owners:\\n\\nThe Justice Department did include several requirements that it says will safeguard the due process rights of property owners. The directives require state and local police to provide additional information showing probable cause that a crime occurred before federal authorities will adopt the seizure. Seizures of under $10,000 will have to be accompanied by a warrant, a related arrest, or the seizure of contraband. Absent those provisions, a U.S. attorney would have to sign off on an adoption.\\n\\nI doubt these restrictions will do much to curb abuses. A showing of “probable cause” is a long way from actually convicting anyone of a crime, and the alleged crime in question does not even have to be committed by the person whose property is seized. It is also notable that most of the restrictions can be set aside if a US attorney decides to sign off on the adoption anyway. as conservative Republican Rep. Darrell Issa puts it, “I’m glad that at least some safeguards will be put in place, but their plan to expand civil forfeiture is, really, just as concerning as it was before.”\\n\\nRadley Balko rightly points out that Sessions’ new policy is a menace to federalism as well as property rights. Many states have enacted reforms preventing law enforcement agencies from profiting from asset forfeitures, thereby reducing incentives to seize the property of people who have not been convicted of any crimes. Equitable sharing circumvents these state laws, by enabling police to profit from seizures through payments funneled through the federal government. As a result, law enforcement agencies will have incentives to prioritize drug cases that are likely to net them money over violent crime and other objectives that state governments might value more.\\n\\nControl over the funding and priorities of state and local law enforcement is a core element of state sovereignty. Sessions’ asset forfeiture policy is a frontal attack on it. Sadly, this undermining of federalism is of a piece with his positions on sanctuary cities (where Sessions is a leading advocate of Trump’s efforts to undermine constitutional federalism in this area) and marijuana enforcement (where Sessions wants to ride roughshod over states that have legalized pot).\\n\\nSessions’ eagerness to sacrifice federalism and property rights to the War on Drugs was entirely predictable, based on his longstanding record prior to becoming attorney general. It was among the reasons why I urged the Senate to “just say no” to his nomination for the position of attorney general. At least for the moment, we are stuck with Sessions.

Since the proposal, the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate twice, and governor Stephen Poloz said in July concerns over financial stability played a role in the policy-decision making process.\\n\\nThe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions confirmed Tuesday the measures they proposed will kick in, and real estate watchers say the regulator has crafted tougher rules than originally envisaged.\\n\\nThe most notable measure is a provision that would require all prospective buyers -- even those with a down payment of over 20% -- to undergo a so-called stress test before a bank can issue a loan. Previously, only buyers with a down payment of less than 20% had to undergo a stress test. Under the stress test, prospective buyers would have to qualify for a mortgage at a rate at whichever is greater: either 2 percentage points above the negotiated rate, or the Bank of Canada\\'s five-year benchmark rate. The central bank\\'s five-year rate stands at 4.89%. The regulator originally proposed the test just cover two percentages point above the negotiated mortgage.\\n\\n\"These revisions reinforce a strong and prudent regulatory regime for residential mortgage underwriting in Canada,\" said Jeremy Rudin, head of the banking watchdog.\\n\\nRobert McLister, founder of the Canadian mortgage-rate comparison site RateSpy.com, said the new rules target the fastest-growing part of the mortgage market -- uninsured mortgages -- and could affect one out of every six prospective home buyers. In Canada, mortgage insurance is mandatory unless the buyer has a down payment of 20% and over.\\n\\n\"This is easily the most groundshaking mortgage rule of all time, and that\\'s not an understatement,\" Mr. McLister said in an interview.\\n\\nEconomists said the tougher mortgage regulations will further hit a softening housing market. Recent data from the Canadian Real Estate Association indicated unadjusted sales in September were 11% below year-ago levels, and price growth has slowed considerably, especially in the Toronto market after the introduction of a foreign-buyer\\'s tax in southern Ontario.\\n\\n\"This will have a far greater impact on house prices than the Bank of Canada recent interest rate hikes,\" said David Madani, economist at forecasting firm Capital Economics. \"Needless to say, these latest mortgage rule changes will have a negative impact on house prices and household wealth.\"\\n\\nTD Bank\\'s economics team said it anticipates the measures will depress housing demand by 5% to 10% once fully implemented.\\n\\nBesides universal stress testing, Canada\\'s banking regulator has also ordered lenders to require the loan-to-value ratio used in evaluating a mortgage \"remain dynamic\" and adjust for local market conditions, and prohibit co-lending arrangements that potentially circumvent existing regulations.\\n\\nIn its most recent assessment of the financial system, the Bank of Canada said more than 80% of new mortgage lending by Canada\\'s big six banks in the Toronto and Vancouver areas covers uninsured mortgages.\\n\\nOne key reasons is that earlier this decade, the Canadian government opted to no longer backstop mortgage insurance on homes valued at 1 million Canadian dollars ($796,000) or greater.\\n\\nIn its review, the Bank of Canada said the proportion of highly indebted uninsured mortgage holders -- incorporating a loan-to-income ratio of over 450% -- rose to 17% last year from 12% in 2014.\\n\\nBruce Joseph, head of Anthem Mortgage Group in Barrie, Ontario, said some mortgage brokers and real-estate agents reckoned the banking regulator would lighten up on some the rules given the recent spell of softness in Canadian house-sale activity. \"They didn\\'t. This is aggressive,\" Mr. Joseph said. He said he anticipates mortgage refinancing will be much tougher to negotiate and could push borrowers to the private-mortgage market, where players aren\\'t regulated.\\n\\nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com',\n",

       " '(Illustration: Luba Myts)\\n\\nFrom the October 20, 2014, issue of National Review\\u200b\\n\\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Republican politicians and strategists are obsessed with the gender gap. Unfortunately, they almost never think clearly about it.\\n\\nFor decades, American women have been more likely to vote for Democrats than men have been in almost every election. It follows that in almost all competitive races, most men pick the Republican candidate and most women the Democratic one. This year’s elections are following that pattern.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn late September, a CNN poll had Democrat Kay Hagan three points ahead of Republican Thom Tillis in the North Carolina Senate race. He was up four points among men, while she was up nine points among women. Around the same time, a Fox News poll had the Iowa Senate race tied, with men backing the Republican candidate by eight points and women the Democratic one by the same margin.\\n\\nDemocrats look at that pattern and conclude that they need to hit “women’s issues” hard both to raise their percentage of female votes and to boost female turnout. Mark Udall, the Democratic senator from Colorado, has spent half of his ad money so far portraying his Republican challenger, Representative Cory Gardner, as an opponent of contraception. Hillary Clinton, speaking in Iowa, has put a feminist twist on the liberal economic agenda: Women, she said, hold most minimum-wage jobs, which on her telling made the Republican position on wage regulation especially harmful and the Democratic position especially helpful to women.\\n\\nRepublicans look at the same pattern and conclude that they have a problem with women that they desperately need to address. They have adopted several strategies toward that end over the years. Some Republican candidates run soft-focus ads emphasizing their humanity and compassion. Some Republican strategists counsel the candidates to downplay their opposition to abortion. Other Republicans say the party should make the case that its policies are better for women than Democratic policies are. Mitt Romney often pointed out during the 2012 campaign how many jobs women had lost under President Obama.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRepublicans are taking all of these steps this year, and taking others too. Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO and a Republican candidate for the Senate from California in 2010, has started a new group to make the party’s case to women. Several Senate candidates are saying that they think the Food and Drug Administration should reclassify oral contraception to make it available without a prescription.\\n\\nSome of these steps might help the Republican party win elections. If they do, though, it is probably not going to be because they shrink the gender gap. The Republican party has a distinctive problem with female voters, but it is one that it cannot and does not need to solve.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat problem has nothing to do with abortion. It has been easy to link the gender gap and abortion, in part because the gap took on its modern dimensions around the same time the parties adopted their current positions on the issue, around 1980. Yet polling that asks people their views on abortion policy or whether they consider themselves “pro-choice” or “pro-life” finds no consistent difference between the sexes, and what differences it finds are small. Earlier this year, Gallup found that 38 percent of men and 41 percent of women think abortion should be legal in “all” or “most” circumstances, while 58 percent of men and 57 percent of women think it should be legal in “only a few” or no circumstances. In contrast, there are large and consistent differences between the married and the single, and between the religious and the irreligious, on abortion-related issues. (The differences are the ones you’d expect.)\\n\\nPro-choice Republican candidates have roughly the same gender gap that pro-life ones do. In 2010, a pro-choice Republican candidate for governor won 57 percent of men and 49 percent of women in Nevada; at the same time, a pro-life Republican candidate for governor won 57 percent of men and 48 percent of women in Wisconsin.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn 2012, two Republican Senate candidates stated their opposition to abortion in cases of rape. Most voters disagreed with that position and many found the way they expressed it offensive. Yet they ended up having slightly smaller gender gaps than some less controversial Republicans running that year. Their remarks, that is, seem to have turned off men and women roughly equally.\\n\\nFemale Republican candidates do not seem to do better than their male colleagues, either. In 2010, Kelly Ayotte and Pat Toomey were the Republican Senate candidates in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, respectively. Both had ten-point gender gaps. Fiorina had an eight-point gap, equal to that of Wisconsin Republican Senate candidate Ron Johnson, on that same Election Day.\\n\\nThe causes of the gender gap are more likely to be found in other issues. Polling has for many years consistently found that women are more supportive than men of social-welfare spending, economic regulation, and gun control, and less supportive of military action. In August, for example, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that the gender gap on raising the minimum wage was in the double digits, with women more supportive. These issues provide an alternative explanation of why the gender gap opened up around 1980: The parties became more divided on size-of-government questions then, too.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n#page#The political difference between the sexes is small but persistent and pervasive. Some subgroups of women generally fall on the conservative side of policy questions but are generally less conservative than the equivalent subgroups of men. Romney won 53 percent of married women and 56 percent of white women, for example, but 60 percent of married men and 62 percent of white men.\\n\\nWhether they are winning or losing, male or female, pro-life or pro-choice, Republican candidates win a larger percentage of male than female votes. Republican candidates who win do not consistently have larger or smaller gender gaps than the ones who lose. The winning candidates, that is, do not tend to be ones who have a particular appeal to women. Compared with the losers, they have higher support among both men and women. George W. Bush did four points better among women in 2004 than Romney did in 2012, but he also did three points better among men.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRepublicans were pleased to see a recent New York Times/CBS News poll that showed them only one point behind Democrats when women were asked which party’s candidate they intended to support in congressional elections. Men were as usual more Republican, by seven points. The gap in 2006, a Democratic landslide year, was four points; in 2010, a Republican landslide year, it was six. Republicans seem to be doing pretty well this year because of increased support from men and women alike, not because they have shrunk the gender gap.\\n\\nThese data suggest that Republicans are thinking about their problems the wrong way. To win the presidency in 2016, they need more women to support them than they got in 2012 or 2008: On that point, the conventional wisdom is obviously correct. But they don’t need more women any more than they need more men, and there is no reason to think that they have better opportunities to make gains among women than among men. The case that Republicans need to take steps that are specifically designed to win the support of a lot more women is a much weaker one than is generally assumed.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean that everything done in the name of shrinking the gender gap is a bad idea. Neither men nor women, in general, prefer candidates to crusade on abortion, so the advice to downplay the issue is not wholly mistaken (although candidates sometimes err in thinking they can avoid it altogether). Humanizing ads have their place. Men are consistently more risk-tolerant than women; if Republicans had an economic message that made the case that free markets and limited government can provide security and not just risk, it would probably help them with both sexes but perhaps a bit more with women.\\n\\nIt is hard to see a political downside to the new Republican tactic of calling for a relaxation of the regulations on oral contraception. Access to contraception may not be as powerful an issue as Democrats hope and Republicans fear: The political scientists John Sides and Lynn Vavreck found no correlation between polls of the presidential race in 2012 and the amount of attention being given to contraception and abortion in the news. But the Democrats seem to be vindicating the Republicans’ tactic by their response to it. They say that ending the requirement of a prescription is no substitute for forcing employers to cover contraceptives at no marginal cost to their employees, something the Obama administration has done and Republicans mostly oppose. Whether or not Republicans win that policy debate, the Democrats are being frustrated in their attempt to portray Republicans as hostile to contraception, and women.\\n\\nThe Colorado Senate race between Udall and Gardner, where contraception has become one of the top issues, could be the most important one this fall. It will be a test of whether the Republican party can compete in states that went twice for Obama. (Most of the competitive Senate races this year are in states that reliably vote for Republican presidential candidates.) Its rising Hispanic population makes it an important sign about the future, too. And if Republicans win there after renewed Democratic accusations that they are waging a “war on women,” perhaps they will be a little less spooked by the gender gap — and more focused on doing what it takes to build their baseline level of support among men and women alike.\\n\\n— Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor of National Review.

       " 'What’s your relationship with AVE like?\\n\\nIt’s good. I think that we have a lot of similarities in our careers and in life—in the way we skate, the spots we like to skate and struggles that we’ve been through in our lives. This is probably the eighth round in our careers now. And it’s funny because I think that we’re both really hard on ourselves. With how self-destructive we’ve been in the past, we’re trying to make up for it in a lot of ways and use our time wisely and try to get the best out of it now.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we interviewed AVE about a year ago he said that you’re the guy who he imagines, “Guy’s at the park right now! Guy’s out skating right now!” Do you guys push each other in that way too?\\n\\nI think so. In a lot of ways, AVE and I have been each other’s motivation. Right when I kinda came back into skateboarding, Anthony came to Girl. And we hadn’t seen each other in a long time. I’m sure we were familiar with each other, but we were in different crowds, you know what I mean? So right away he’s, like, “Hey, man, stoked you’re back and stuff and I know you’re recovering and I’ve battled a lot of demons myself.” So I just got his phone number and started going to meetings and through hooking up on a more regular basis we became really close. And I know a lot of it came from when we started skating the Berrics back when it was just a private skatepark, and that brought us really close. But we’ve also been through two videos together. He went through the Alien video and the Vans video and then I did Fully Flared and Pretty Sweet. And I think what’s crazy is that it’s not so much about always being on every session together, but just like kinda learning moves and taking them to the streets and being there and being supportive through each other’s parts. It’s kind of like going to war with a buddy. And sharing those moments at those premiers or talking to each other about getting stuff done, it’s been really cool and I’m happy to share that time with him. I couldn’t imagine it being the same without that.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou guys are definitely both kind of hard on yourselves and Anthony is especially hard on himself.\\n\\nAnthony is a little bit more hard on himself than me, and not in a bad way, but I think in a good way. He’s kind of a perfectionist. I’ve seen him get clips throughout these videos and I’ve seen the clips and I’ve known that he’s went back and did it again to get it better. And we all do it—for that two more inches of grind which no one’s gonna be able to tell the difference or whatever. And all this success that he’s had is through how tough he is on himself. He likes to make things a battle and sometimes I like to battle too. And I think that when people that have suffered in life, they often times like that battle and they enjoy that. Things that come easy to certain people, maybe we don’t enjoy that as much and there’s no reward in it. So sometimes I think those battles go deeper than the trick we’re trying.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs there anything that he’s critical about that seems ridiculous to you? ‘Cause he carries on like he weighs 250 pounds or something.\\n\\nIt’s funny, man. I was just talking with him about it on this trip. I’ve looked back to when I first got back into skateboarding with Fully Flared and I look at photos and I’m, like, “Damn, I was fat.” We’ve been through a couple surgeries and injuries in which you could find some comfort in food. It’s good to have someone be honest and tell you you’ve put on a few. You know, it’s definitely the way that you take care of yourself, the way you eat. We’ve even exercised or whatever and gotten personal trainers; stuff like that. And I think that, not in a jockish way, but it’s more for a better lifestyle and to preserve being able to perform at your best on a board. Not even perform, but just—we love skateboarding so much and we want to do it the longest we can, without milking it. Not just trying to milk our career, but actually bring something to the table. I think there are a lot of ways that we both still do that. And I like to have that kind of relationship with AVE because a lot of people in skateboarding are just really young and fearless and they live a really wild lifestyle and that’s just a part of skateboarding. I really love that, but that’s just not our story anymore. We’ve been through a lot and time has lead us to live this lifestyle that we’re living now, you know? And not to say that it can’t go both ways, but this is where we are.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWere you surprised that Anthony got Skater of the Year for 2015?\\n\\nI wasn’t surprised because I kind of felt like it was gonna go that way, but I was a little scared because times have changed so much. I think that social media has a role in it and you have a lot more people weighing in. A lot of the time in social media people just like to speak negative and give a negative opinion more than a positive one. And there’s so many reasons why people would want other people to win, like, “Oh, this guy did this many parts or did so many things.” I skate our park with Anthony all the time and even I would be, like, “Man, let me film you and post some stuff.” And he would never let me. And it was just like I wanted to help in that way, you know what I mean, to put out more content for him. Because if he wanted to, Anthony could have put out multiple parts and done multiple things and done a lot of social stuff, but he’s just not into that. And it’s not about that, man. I think it’s about the quality of his work. When I look at Anthony’s whole career and everything he does—it’s like he bleeds Thrasher. And I know from his personal relationship with you, it’s like anything he’s gonna do it goes to Thrasher. Outside of that, when I look at skateboarding and what he’s doing with FA/Hockey and the kids he represents, it’s like he’s breeding the next group of people that are gonna love Thrasher and carry on its traditions as well. And I think that speaks loudly.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou were part of the first SOTY year where people started campaigning for their favorites on social media. Were you angry or disappointed when you didn’t win Skater of the Year that year?\\n\\nNo. I thought that David killed it way harder than me and I think that same thing—that he is more Thrasher than me. He killed that part and even with all of that controversy, I still feel like that’s sort of a win. It was good for me. Just to have my name in there with David Gonzalez was a good thing. I may have a lot of self-hatred or whatever, but it’s just, like, I wasn’t up to that dude’s par, you know what I mean? To be grouped with him, it was an honor. But would I have been hyped to have won it, of course. It’s always been a dream of mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou were definitely on par with him.\\n\\nYeah, but I said the same thing to Anthony. I’m, like, “Man, just to be considered, whatever happens with the situation, it’s a good thing.” ‘Cause I’m sure Anthony wanted it. Who knows if he didn’t get it this year he might not be able to get it again. But just to be grouped in that category and to be viewed as one of the top skaters is where you want to be. ‘Cause everyone really does kill it and even if you don’t get it it’s not like you suck. I think that there’s a lot of rad skaters that haven’t got it. And for that matter, all the ones that have totally deserve it.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou had a really big year in 2015 with amazing, crazy tricks on the phone. And then your big announcement for Nike was done in the same style. Do you still care about doing other kinds of media projects like video parts and interviews or do you think the future of what you’re gonna do as a pro skater is gonna mostly go out through iPhone clips on social media?\\n\\nI mean, I would hope not. Because right now, it’s not that I’ve pulled back from social media, but having done a lot of stuff just with the phones last year it’s, like, “I want to do another video part.” I know that all filming doesn’t have to be on the level of Ty Evans, but I know there’s a lot of other cool ways to do it too. With the iPhone stuff, I think what happened was that Brandon Biebel was on a comeback and we just wanted to be together and that was a comfortable way of just not taking it so serious. You skate with your friends and you get some fun clips. Last year with Brandon was probably the most fun I’ve had skateboarding in a long time. Right when I got back on Girl Brandon really took me in. We would go to Sacramento and, like, his house was my house and just everything—his spots, his filmers, his friends, anything. I’ve always had this true love for Biebel, and if you know him you know that he’s just the raddest dude and a super sick skater. The social media, it just brought him back up so quick and it was super powerful. It motivated us as well and re-sparked us on filming. This year both Brandon and I are working on street parts. But some people just don’t like posting themselves. Anthony and a lot of my favorite skaters don’t post themselves. It’s just a personal thing. And I wouldn’t want them to be pushed out because of that. We could lose a lot of great skateboarders if posting yourself became the epitome of skateboarding. But I do think this: I think there’s a way you could do good commercials with quality filmers for good brands and post them on social media. Because the fact of the matter is a lot of people just view skateboarding from their phone now and I don’t know if some people have the attention span anymore to get through some of these full-length parts. It’s sad.\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah, totally. But were you ever embarrassed? Was there ever a point where you’re, like, “Fuck, man, I can’t put up another clip of myself?”\\n\\nIt was tough to put myself out there like that. But then again I have an addictive personality. So probably once I got over that, it was a very easy thing to do. The other thing with that is I think it’s rad for the kids, because I do love being able to reach out to people like that. It’s cool for me to do a trick and have someone be super stoked on it because that brings me back to when I was a kid. If I could have commented on Tony Hawk’s trick or Mark Gonzales’ trick and maybe had a chance of them replying back to me or maybe going in my page and liking some of my photos, that would’ve been incredible. I think it’s a great tool for an upcoming skateboarder to be discovered or for someone that lacks the resources to be seen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you were younger you’d have video parts where you did tricks in the World park or even at a contest or demo and, as fans, we didn’t care. We loved it all. And then there was a while where it had to be strictly street and people were traveling the world for a perfect manual pad. What’s your take on real street vs. skatepark obstacles as far as, like, the value of the footage or the value of the trick?\\n\\nThere are certain people and terrain inside a skatepark that if you saw a clip you would know that he could take it to the streets. I’ve been in that situation before where I’ve pulled some stuff off in a skatepark but I could never take it to the streets. And I think at the end of the day it always comes back to the streets. It’s a weird time, though. A new generation might think that it’s the opposite. Shane O’Neill doesn’t put his gnarliest stuff on Instagram and neither does Dakota, neither does Leo, neither does Nyjah, you know what I mean? It’s, like, imagine what those people could be doing and putting out there if they just filmed everything for social media. But they still hold on to it and save it and that’s really cool. I may pull back a little bit so I can film a video part, but it’s a big part of skateboarding now that you can’t ignore.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re kinda on the forefront of some of this stuff. You were the first guy where people campaigned on social media for SOTY and where people were outraged on social media.\\n\\nYeah, like, to even go back to that, that actually kind of bummed me out because I thought David did really well and people are just like that. They wouldn’t have been happy either way. If somebody else got it and Anthony didn’t get it this year there would be an uproar or whatever. Those are mostly the type of people who like to comment on social media, you know what I mean? I’m sure you have your fans that push for you but with something like this it’s politics, man, and everybody likes to get involved.\\n\\n\\n\\nDid it hurt to have people say negative things online when you switched sponsors?\\n\\nYeah, it did actually. Because it was a situation where it’s like, I’m not gonna try to defend or explain myself in any way. I think some of that negativity was good for me. It kind of toughened up my skin a bit. For skateboarding, there’s a lot of kids who live and breathe it and I don’t like to bring all of those politics into it. I still want kids to have that same fantasy and dream of how cool it is and just leave that stuff out. It takes the romance out of skateboarding. There’s been a lot of people and a lot of my friends that are really stoked about it. People have come up to me and said they’re happy about the move and happy about what I’m doing and it really means a lot. I don’t feel like I have to defend my love for skateboarding and everything that I’ve put into it. The same with Nike, they’re big contributors to skateboarding and have the resources to do a lot for us. I’m stoked to be on the team and work with the internal team and look forward to doing great things with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo are you gonna start a skateboard company with Eric Koston?\\n\\nWe’re working on it. What I like to tell people about that one is, like, you know, it wasn’t like we were sitting back rubbing our hands, like, “I’m gonna wait ‘till I’m 40 to start a skateboard brand.” It’s something that will develop over time. I’ve always skated and worked for the Girl brands as if they were my own. It was like a dynasty for me. I don’t want to have any resentments on that or let that affect all of the good times that we did have. Because it was super rad. I think that in skateboarding there will probably never be a company like Girl skateboards ever again. And I’m super proud to have been a part of it. ‘Cause I think that skateboarding is changing in a lot of ways. And not in bad ways, but I don’t know if brands are gonna be able to carry on the way that Girl did it. I would hope to carry on some of those same principles and traditions as we did with Girl, and some new ones of our own.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow hard was it to sit down your friends at Girl and tell them you were quitting?\\n\\nUltimately, it was a very hard thing for me to come to terms with. Even after the move, emotions are still raw, like an open wound. I think too much probing doesn’t allow me to heal. What’s more important right now is letting go and looking ahead. I definitely will always have that blood flowing through me because it’s, like, I’ve always been there for them like my brothers. I think a lot of them know that whether or not it’s been spoken. The people I do see, it’s a very known thing. It just goes without saying.\\n\\n\\n\\nLike mommy and daddy are breaking up but we still love you very much.\\n\\nWith someone like Mike Mo, we’ve shared such a special bond. Even all of those guys like Brandon and Sean, we’ve shared such a special bond that it’s, like, if changing sponsors comes between us there probably wasn’t a lot of substance there to begin with. You do spend a lot of time on tours, on trips and that is some of the special bonding time where things happen and memories get created and so those will definitely be missed.\\n\\n\\n\\nOkay, let’s get back to some AVE stuff. AVE is really funny to me. He’s like Han Solo. He’s like the toughest, most solid skating guy, but then the glass is always comedically half empty with him. How would you describe him?\\n\\nAnthony cares and Anthony’s sensitive, but if it’s something that he really gives a shit about—and, like, skateboarding he does—he’s very strict about it and he takes a stand where sometimes people just follow like sheep. He’s not the type to become victim to what everyone else is doing. Everybody’s usually always trying to please everybody and he’s not really a people pleaser and that might rub people the wrong way. For that matter, Anthony does rub people the wrong way. And I think it’s good for me because Anthony helps me out a lot. He’ll be, like, “Man, get the fuck off that goddamn phone and go film a video part! What are you doing?” And I need certain people in my life like Anthony that are gonna be very honest with me. Some people might pussyfoot around it or sugarcoat it. You know Anthony’s not that dude. That’s why I love him. He always gives me an honest opinion. Anthony shows up for real life stuff for me. Our relationship runs deeper than just skateboarding.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you could have one of his tricks which trick would you want to have?\\n\\nThe switch front crook, probably.\\n\\n\\n\\nDude. The AVE grind.\\n\\nCan we get that certified?\\n\\n\\n\\nNo problem. Consider it law. What’s your favorite thing to treat yourself with in Hawaii?\\n\\nCoconut water. It’s been a big thing. We got a case of it. Evan’s been bringing it by the house a lot. It’s been keeping us hydrated. But the thing I most like to treat myself with is probably a clip.\\n\\n\\n\\nHave you been fucking with any of those scoops?\\n\\nYeah, I do. I like the plate lunch scoops. Rice. Macaroni. I’m feeling the scoops. The best thing I’ve actually been treating myself with is sleep. You know I just had a baby and Benny gave me some little website that had a bunch of new movies on it and at night I just sit in my bed and watch these movies.\\n\\n‘Cause as a new father those days are gone. They’re gone.\\n\\nIt’s a blessing to have a child. Don’t get me wrong. But it’s also a blessing to get some rest. You know, my lady’s probably gonna read this and be, like, “What is he talking about? He sleeps through the night.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAre we gonna see you making a SOTY run in 2016? Is this the beginning of it? Are we gonna be here next year on your trip?\\n\\nYou know, I wish that the SOTY thing was a little bit more positive at the end.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou mean that people wouldn’t get so volatile about it?\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s funny. They picked Mike Carroll in ‘94. Who knows if someone was pissed about it. Like, “You idiots! It shoulda been Ron Allen!”\\n\\nYeah. You know what, I’m always on that run whether it looks like it or not. I’m always trying to do it to the best of my ability. I think that a lot of stuff that matters in that SOTY run too is having the opportunities to take the trips and document a lot of the stuff. It’s the biggest part of it. But I’m actually planning on taking a lot of trips and hopefully doing a lot of filming this year. But I’m not going to lie, I’m a big Shane O’Neill fan and I would love to see him get it.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo some people know you as the cute little kid from the Blind video or the Powell videos but you’re about to turn 40 in three months. Does that number mean anything to you?\\n\\nNo, it doesn’t mean as much to me as it might mean something to someone else. I want to be the type of skater where skaters won’t judge their age because they can use me as a reference. Because I see people that are, like, 30, maybe coming up on their mid-30s and having to struggle with age and it’s, like, man, you can do so much at that time. I want to put 40 on the map.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI think Dave Duncan might have already done that.\\n\\nThere was a time when they were trying to push out Mike Vallely and Mark Gonzales and Jason Lee in those World days when maybe I even might have fell victim to being, like, “Yeah, once you get to a certain age it’s like you need to be pushed out.” And I think Mark Gonzales proved that wrong during that video and even to this day. But if I could do anything in these years I would like to prove that age is just a number and to enjoy it. Skateboarding is an art form where you don’t have to be the biggest rail skater and you don’t have to be the most tech. We respect a lot of different styles and approaches to skateboarding these days. I think it’s about fun and creativity. I see people out there like Cory Kennedy and he looks like he has a lot of fun skateboarding and that’s very attractive to me.',\n",
       " 'I walk down the narrow basement stairs with ease, but before I can cross the entryway into the warm candlelit temple, the oungan, a male priest in the Haitian Vodou tradition, hands me a ceramic jar filled with water. Pointing to the entryway floor, he motions towards three spaces and asks me to drop water for Papa Legba, the Vodou spirit who grants or denies human access to communicate with any of the Vodou spirits, or lwas.\\n\\n\\n\\nI pour the water. My salute to the gatekeeper had been approved. I enter.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\n“If the spirits aren’t happy they’ll tell me,” he says, smiling slightly. “They’ll tell me what kind of energy you have.\\n\\n“A lot of people come in just to see what Vodou is about,” he cautions. “The spirits can tell your intentions.”\\n\\nWhen I reach for my camera, he objects. “Spirits don’t like pictures. As a priest you don’t do anything the spirits won’t be happy with.”\\n\\nVodou is no spectacle. That’s the primary message I received as an inquiring writer journeying into New York’s tightly-knit, yet surprisingly diverse Vodou community. The voyage began in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, at the South Oxford Space arts center, for Verite Sou Tanbou: The Truth about Haitian Vodou. It was the first installment of a three-part series of educational workshops about Vodou. That day, Oungan Dieudonné Jean-Jacques spoke calmly in his native tongue, which was translated for the racially and linguistically diverse attendees who packed the room to capacity. In the crowded hallway, between the moments of silence, attendees whispered amongst each other in Creole, French and English—even a scattering of Spanish.\\n\\nBenin (formerly Dahomey), a slender sliver of a country in West Africa, is widely considered the cradle of Vodou, which came to Haiti (then called Saint-Domingue) in the eighteenth century. Vodouists believe there is one distant God, Bondyè, who is the creator of all things––but they serve a long list of lwas through prayer and by presenting offerings, creating devotional objects and altars, and participating in ceremonies brought to life through traditional song, dance, spirit possession and animal sacrifice. Lwas are said to speak with, guide, and offer protection to the faithful on their journey through life.\\n\\nWhile the Vodou community is constantly expanding to people of various ethnic, social and economic backgrounds, it remains a misunderstood spiritual world and a stigmatized religion. Many Vodouists find themselves constantly trying to set the record straight about a culture they respect and love.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\n“If you consult any dictionary,” says Professor Patrick Bellegarde-Smith of the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, an oungan himself, “you shall see that the definitions of ‘voodoo’—it won\\'t use generally the Haitian spelling of Vodou—remain static over many decades.”\\n\\nProfessor Bellegarde-Smith says the widespread misrepresentation of Vodou came to the fore during the U.S. military occupation of Haiti, from 1915 to 1934, when, as he puts it, “Hollywood, as loyal Americans, come to the rescue of the U.S. state, and justified further that brutish occupation by creating the ‘voodoo’ we now know, and the zombie films that became a basic staple.”\\n\\nIndeed, when I Googled, “what is voodoo?” the first hit describes not an ancient religion but a black religious cult characterized by sorcery and spirit possession. Even in Haiti itself, it wasn’t until 2003 that the country’s Catholic president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, acknowledged Vodou as one of Haiti’s official religions.\\n\\nRecently, three New York Vodouists each shared their unique story and deeply personal relationship to the religion: a passionate Haitian-born musician, a priestess and scholar who works to educate the masses about her religion, and a young Arab priest who was unexpectedly summoned by the spirits into the foreign land of Vodou.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nMusic Moves the Spirit\\n\\nPerched on an aged leather chair, Val Jeanty rests the back of one hand over her mouth while the other navigates the track pad on her laptop. Her mahogany eyes are alive and focused on the screen in front of her. As she adjusts the levels on her soundboard, the beat of drums and unidentifiable instruments pulsate throughout her Bedford-Stuyvesant nook. The rest of the world is clearly silenced for Jeanty, her focus on the music so intense it seems as if her studio has solid, soundproof walls that separate it from the rest of her spacious loft, only it doesn’t.\\n\\n“So how long have you been living here?” I venture.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nLooking up, she breaks into a wide smile and laughter explodes, her cheek bones reaching for the sky. She’s back. She lowers the music.\\n\\nJeanty, thirty-eight, is tall and slender, casually clad in army fatigue pants and layered red and black cotton tees. Her amber-toned face is radiant and bare, tiny dark studs rest in her ears, and a black scarf hangs around her neck.\\n\\nVodou was a natural part of Jeanty’s family and culture growing up in Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\n“You know they say, ‘Haitians are 85 percent Catholic, but 100 percent Vodouists,’” she relates, cracking a popular cultural joke. Indeed, many Haitians see no conflict in being both Catholic and Vodouists. Like other ethnic groups in the Americas, they have combined Christian beliefs with distinct traditional practices, and some believe that to be a good Vodouist, you have to be a good Christian.\\n\\nJeanty’s late grandmother was a mambo. Decrying what she considers “the fancy, mystical description,” a mambo, says Jeanty, is like a shaman—someone who acts as intermediary between the natural and spiritual worlds.\\n\\n“It’s about being connected to nature,” Jeanty explains. Her grandmother communicated with the plants and could identify exactly which one was poisonous or which was meant for healing–which leaf cured a tummy ache and which could put you to sleep. Jeanty herself is a strong believer in animism, the concept that natural objects, phenomena, and the universe itself possess souls. “Everything is alive,” says Jeanty. “If I walk next to a tree I’m not going to spit on the tree, because I’m spitting on myself.”\\n\\nFor her, “[Vodou] is more of a way of life, less of a religion.” It’s about listening to the ancestors speak to you and accepting the information they bring.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\n“I was born in the pouch. In Vodou that kid is a special kid…they carry a heavy burden,” says Jeanty, noting that not all Haitian children are born into Vodou, but that those who are tend to stay the course.\\n\\nJeanty says the Vodou within her was made evident by childhood experiences of unconsciously, yet systematically, rising from bed in the middle of the night and marching across her family’s land to their property gates. From this, her family knew Papa Legba would be a special lwa for her. Described as a small old man dressed in rags who walks with a cane but is particularly powerful, Legba is the chief of crossroads and gates. Jeanty’s routine walk to her family’s gates seemed to be symbolic.\\n\\nIn Vodou, certain days of the week are dedicated to particular lwas, which each have distinct personalities and different roles. Some can be quite “feisty,” Jeanty says. “If you’re not connected to certain deities you should stay away,” she laughs.\\n\\nJeanty doesn’t believe one has to systematically serve all lwas; rather, you naturally navigate towards the ones you connect to. For her, two in particular are important. Jeanty serves Papa Legba on his day, which is Monday, by pouring water at the entryway of her loft. The cleansing element of water clears Jeanty’s home and spiritual passageway so whatever needs to happen in her life can, and will.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nShe also honors Erzulie Dantor on Tuesday by wearing the lwa’s favorite colors of red and black. Known as the Black Madonna for her motherly and protective quality, Erzulie Dantor represents the energy Jeanty naturally has within. Jeanty doesn’t have children but her face lights up when she speaks of her students at The Door, a local organization that serves disconnected youth, where she teaches drum classes, percussion and DJ skills.\\n\\nExchanges with the lwa should happen naturally, Jeanty insists. “I don’t think about Legba, I just give him water. You don’t do it because of Legba, you do it for you. I naturally reach for red and black on Tuesday. It’s synchronicity.”\\n\\nJeanty says her Afro-electronica music “is not for commercial use, it’s for the spirit”—and for exposing others to Haitian culture. “I always start with a primitive rhythmic pattern, which is definitely influenced by the Vodou culture.” From there, she improvises, channeling whatever expression she hears and mixing in high-tech digital instruments alongside the traditional Haitian drum.\\n\\nJeanty’s goal is to use her unique music and positive energy to subtly expose people to Vodou. She has performed at the Whitney Museum and the Museum of Modern Art, and internationally at music festivals in Austria and Switzerland. In May, she’ll perform in Poland at the Planete + Doc Film Festival, which will feature The United States of Hoodoo, a documentary in which she speaks about sound and frequency and how they connect the realms of spirituality.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nWhile she is not an angry warrior—Jeanty emanates peace as much as the wooden Buddha that sits at the center of her shrine—she is passionate about addressing the misrepresentations of Vodou culture, and boils at the thought of it being used as a commodity. The Internet is a hotbed for Vodou commodification and, in many cases, fraud. She recoils at the fact that one can find a “love potion” or “money spell” online from an “authentic” Haitian mambo as long as you have $129.99 and a PayPal account.\\n\\n“When you go to the priest to get a boyfriend or girlfriend, it becomes mundane, it becomes a circus,” she says, her signature laughter buckling into the air. “You get away from the real Vodou, and it becomes a Gucci T-shirt.”\\n\\nReal Vodou, she says, is very subtle. “You don’t even have to talk too much. If it’s dramatic, it’s not real.”\\n\\nThe alleged association with evil hexes is what most bothers Jeanty and many other Vodouists.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\n“Dolls and pins are a creation of Hollywood, closer to German and English witchcraft than to African witchcraft,” says Professor Bellegarde-Smith. “Religions and witchcraft are not the same thing. The lwa are beyond good and evil, and since we have free will, one can ‘use’ them for both, realizing that there will be beneficent outcomes or hell to pay for what each one of us has done with her/his free will.”\\n\\n“It’s the person that knows little tricks,” says Jeanty. “Don’t underestimate the power of the human mind. You can brew up a spell. The people that run the government, the banks -- they’re sorcerers.”\\n\\nThe evil that exists within each of us is real, Jeanty confirms with no hesitation, the question is how individuals—vodouists or not—choose to address this energy.\\n\\n“Vodou is like a gun,” she says, her tone serious. “You can pick it up and save your grandmother’s life or shoot yourself.” In Vodou, there is no good or bad, she insists. “It’s just energy.”\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOut of Africa\\n\\nDowoti Desir’s dark locks, spiraled on the ends, majestically drape beyond her shoulders. Her eyes lower as she looks at the brightly beaded ason she’d removed from her altar, a sacred rattle made from dried gourd that serves as an instrument of power for a Vodou priest. Initiates are “given the ason” to mark the end of their initiation and new title as oungan or mambo.\\n\\n“Vodou is my foundation and the foundation of my motherland,” says Desir, fifty-two, a mambo asogwe, the highest female member of the priesthood. “We should all know who we are and celebrate our histories, knowledge and ourselves.”\\n\\nDesir, who was born in Port-au-Prince, says the mere fact that she had to be initiated into Vodou speaks volumes about the way history has affected Africans in the Americas, and why it’s pertinent to preserve a tie to their traditional roots.\\n\\nWith the soulful and commanding voice of a natural storyteller, Desir speaks about finding her met-tet—master of one’s head. The met-tet is said to be the most significant lwa to walk with a person on their journey through life. It’s generally the first lwa to possess an individual in ceremony, or the lwa that possesses that individual most often. The met-tet often has characteristics that are parallel to those of the individual.\\n\\nHistorically, one’s met-tet was passed on through one’s lineage, but the Transatlantic slave trade ruptured that process. “The kinship ties that are there normally, you don’t have them, you don’t know what they are,” says Desir, her almond shaped eyes tightening and her voice raw with emotion. “Even the process of getting initiated or knowing that one has to be initiated is part of it, it’s a traumatic experience itself.”\\n\\nIn 1791, a Vodou ceremony was the catalyst that mobilized enslaved Africans to rebel against their French colonial oppressors, sparking the Haitian Revolution, which ultimately led to the liberation of the Haitian people and the foundation of the world’s first independent black republic. Desir believes the spirit of Vodou she finds present within herself is a gift from both her African lineage and her Haitian heritage.\\n\\n“Some things keep appearing in your dreams, and at some point you think you’re losing your mind,” says Desir. “But it’s because the thing that is literally in your blood, the memory, the DNA that carries all of this data - it needs to manifest.”\\n\\nAs a mambo, Desir has some clients she works with spiritually, but doesn’t solicit work or organize ceremonies. Becoming a priestess was, in her belief, a prenatal arrangement. “It’s an arrangement we made with our ancestors,” she says. “We’re all born into the world with a mission, with a crown. Some of us have heavier crowns.”\\n\\nA gold ring with a ruby gem sits above the serpent ring that wraps around Desir’s finger. The dual rings are tributes to her met-tet, Damballa Weddo—the powerful serpent sky god and father of all thelwa—his wife Ayida Weddo, the rainbow serpent, and Ogun, the warrior who always walks with Damballa.\\n\\nLike Jeanty, Desir laments that Vodou has been stigmatized for far too long. “These are sacred spaces that people want to dismiss as being hocus pocus or magic—something that is not real,” she says. “Some of us have been fighting the vilification.”\\n\\nIt is this commitment to clarifying what Vodou is and is not that has made Desir both an advocate for the tradition and a vocal opponent of those who would muddle its image, particularly people who equate Vodou with devil worship.\\n\\nAs Professor Bellegarde-Smith notes, some Protestants in both Haiti and the United States have argued that the devastating 2010 earthquake was God\\'s wrath against Haitians for insisting on practicing their ancestral religion—most notoriously American televangelist Pat Robertson, who attributed the disaster to the Haitian people\\'s \"pact with the devil.\"\\n\\n“There is a problem of straight up Afrophobia,” says Desir—a problem we must continue to work on, she adds.\\n\\nDesir is founder and president of the DDPA Watch Group, an international human rights coalition working on democratic, cultural and educational activities related to the United Nations Durban Declaration & Program of Action (DDPA)—a 2009 “moral mandate” by the UN to “end the scourge of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.” The mandate declared the Transatlantic slave trade a crime against humanity, and, in Desir’s view, “leaves the door open for African descendants to pursue legal recourse in the form of reparations.”\\n\\nDesir’s organization pushes for public policies in support of this struggle, and advocates for financial reparations.\\n\\n“This political work is what makes Vodou a relevant practice in the twenty-first century,” says Desir. “We seek balance, equilibrium, justice and healing. The objectives of social justice and social change are mirrored in Vodou. For me, as a priest this is a means of maintaining that connection between communities of the living and those of the dead.”\\n\\nIt has been suggested that part of the problem of Vodou’s image is that it doesn’t have a go-to “holy book” that could clarify any misconceptions or outline the principles.\\n\\nBut “it’s not supposed to,” says Desir. “It’s an ancient religion with tenets that are passed on orally.” Vodou is not text, but experiential, she continues. “We live, and we breathe, and we dance and we engage with the world. It’s a body of knowledge. It’s not just a religion or form of spiritual practice…it’s an ethical and moral way of being in the world. Vodou is a discipline that teaches you how to respect the environment, community, and nation.”\\n\\nThe story of Haitian Vodou is the story of the human experience, she says, concluding that “as long as we are afraid of each other, we will never be free.”\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nFrom Mohammed to Lwas\\n\\nOn a recent Sunday evening when the freezing cold choked the life out of usually boisterous Flatbush Avenue, retreating to a warm subterranean space was a delight. The scent of roasting pineapple wafted by as Oungan Amer Ahmed and I sat chair-width apart to discuss his peculiar path into Haitian Vodou.\\n\\nAhmed’s demeanor is welcoming, his voice calm, his smile inviting, his chestnut eyes piercing. Ahmed was exhausted - he’d just hosted a spiritual client for a full week. She had a “zombie in her body,” and he and his spiritual mother “did the work.” Being an oungan is hard work and takes a toll on the body, he says. Ahmed takes Sunday off from healing whenever possible. He is joyous and ready to talk about the entry to the spiritual world he loves.\\n\\nSliding his index finger across an iPad screen, Ahmed swiped through images of the many ceremonies hosted in this converted basement, which serves as a temple. In one photo, wearing a gold trimmed teal boubou (traditional African robe), Ahmed’s youthful chai-toned skin seems to glow under the light as he watches his spirit mom—the woman who gave him his “new life” in Haitian Vodou and guides him through his journey—possessed by Erzulie Dantor. Clad in a full-length indigo dress, her tresses resting under a maroon head wrap, she lovingly serves her favorite food, griot (a fried pork dish) to a line of drummers, who open their mouths without missing a beat on the drums. In other photos, the woman appears wide-eyed while Ahmed helps her to stand up.\\n\\nAs a pre-teen, Ahmed came to the United States from the Middle East (he does not wish to share which country). Initially settling in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, his family later purchased a home in Canarsie, a predominately Caribbean neighborhood also in Brooklyn.\\n\\n“I used to be sick,” he recalls, tying a red scarf around his head. Ahmed, now twenty-nine, was known as a child for his sporadic bouts of unconsciousness, during which he would aimlessly roam the streets for varying amounts of time. When he came to, he often had no recollection of where he was or how he’d arrived there. His parents were worried, and his behavior incited curious stares and whispers in his small Muslim hometown. “There were moments when I would talk to myself,” he said, stroking his goatee.\\n\\nThe solo conversations were enough to disturb his parents, but more alarming was the fact that he was speaking a language they couldn’t understand. Thinking he was either using drugs or possessed by an evil spirit, they took him to the mosque for an exorcism.\\n\\nThat exorcism didn’t seem to work, he says, although before long the bouts of unconsciousness ceased and Ahmed went back to being himself again. It would be years before he experienced such symptoms again, but the voice in his head never stopped. As Ahmed tells it, that voice was what ultimately led him to his current spiritual path.\\n\\n“I always heard that voice in my head,” he says, “But it was normal for me to talk back to it. I never knew it was a language until I got into junior high school.”\\n\\nIt wasn’t until his school days in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where he had many Haitian classmates, that Ahmed says he realized the voice in his head was speaking to him in Haitian Creole. His friends found it strange, but cool that he could speak their language, recalls Ahmed, and affectionately nicknamed him Ti Blanc - little white boy - in Creole.\\n\\nFour years ago, he once again experienced the same unexplained roaming of his childhood, this time accompanied by excruciating headaches. Six weeks of Ahmed’s problems with no answers was more than enough for his parents to admit him to Kings County Hospital for a three-day psychiatric evaluation. “They thought I was going psycho. They wanted to know if I [had] my mind,” says Ahmed.\\n\\nAs part of the evaluation, the doctors asked him a series of basic questions: What is your name? Do you know what today’s date is? Do you know where you are? He answered all of the questions accurately, he says, and assured them he did not want to harm himself. Before being released from the hospital, a nurse told him, “There is nothing wrong with you. You have a spiritual problem. You need to connect to your spirit.”\\n\\nIntrigued by the nurse’s comment, Ahmed sought a spiritual reading from his friend’s godfather, who was active in Santeria, an Afro-Caribbean religion centered on Yoruba beliefs and traditions with Roman Catholic influences. But the man told him he couldn’t receive his initiation in Santeria. Half-asking, half-telling, the man said, “I see you speak another language.”\\n\\n“The ancestors of that language want you to come to them,” the man continued.\\n\\nPuzzled, Ahmed replied, “I speak Arabic, English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole.”\\n\\n“That’s it—Haitian Creole,” the man affirmed. “The ancestors of that language want you to receive your initiation in Haitian Vodou.”\\n\\n“Oh no, I am not going to do that,” he said, shaking his head.\\n\\nYet he was intrigued. He had to know if they could help. So Ahmed lit a candle and asked the Haitian ancestors for guidance. He didn’t hear anything the first week, but then one night, a song came to him in a dream and he saw a serpent, which spoke to him, saying: “I am Damballa Weddo.” It was only later that he connected that vision to the serpent lwa.\\n\\n“I’m going to show you who is going to help you,” Ahmed says Damballa told him. “This woman is going to be your mother and give you a better life.” The lwa instructed Ahmed to go to St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan, where he would meet a lady. Ahmed acquiesced. “I wanted to meet this miracle lady,” he says, seemingly still in awe.\\n\\nAhmed visited the church several times over the course of a few weeks.\\n\\n“On the third week, when I got up to leave, I saw this woman.” Clutching his belly, he says, “I got this butterfly feeling in my stomach.” It turned out the woman attended St. Patrick’s Cathedral and was also a Haitian Vodou priestess.\\n\\nAhmed explained his dream to the mambo. He said their energies immediately clicked and they began forming a spiritual connection. She began telling him about Vodou. Ahmed entered a secretive seven-day initiation, partly in New York and partly in Haiti; oath-bound secrets prevent him from divulging exactly what happened.\\n\\nUnder the tutelage of his new spirit mom, Ahmed started regleman, the process for learning the culture and practice of Vodou, including the rituals and the many lwas.\\n\\n“Your body, your energy travels to the ancestors. You are re-born,” he says, shaking his head intently.\\n\\nThe ailments that plagued Ahmed prior to initiation have since dissipated. “I came to Vodou for my own healing,” he says, but insists, “I didn’t choose. The spirit chose me. Why they chose me, I’ll have to call the spirit and let you ask them,” he says, laughing.\\n\\nThree years after his initiation, Ahmed is an active oungan with several clients and three spiritual children (those who he initiated.) He says he’s been called to the highest level of priesthood, which is asogwe, his current title. He reads dreams, creates protections, reverses spells and provides other healings.\\n\\n“I love to do magic,” he confirms, noting that he particularly likes “love magic.” If you want to re-connect with an estranged family member or resurrect a flailing relationship, Ahmed says he can help, and ensures he is not one of the con artists Jeanty cautions against.\\n\\n“I didn’t come to Vodou to work or to make a dollar,” says Ahmed. “I could be in a bar and the spirit tells me to talk to someone. You pay the spirit, not me.”\\n\\nAhmed says there is no go-to formula for healing. “The spirit is going to come and tell [me] what to do, what items [I] need and where [I] have to do it,” he says, adding that he cannot reveal the specifics of his methods. After all, insists Ahmed, “magic is secret.”',\n",

She says that most Americans don\\'t have a healthy diet, and therefore don\\'t get the vitamins and minerals they need.\\n\\n\"You\\'re not getting any of these micronutrients from Coke and Twinkies,\" said Block.\\n\\n\"Two-thirds of us are overweight, a quarter over 50 have two or more chronic conditions, so there\\'s a substantial population that one would hesitate to call healthy.\"\\n\\nBlock went on to say, \"There\\'s always a nontrivial minority that\\'s actually getting a questionable level of some micronutrients. So multivitamins are a backstop against our poor diet.\"\\n\\nCara Welch, senior vice president of the Natural Products Association, agreed with Block.\\n\\n\"It is pretty common that in this day and age with the lifestyle many of us lead that we don\\'t always take the time to have a balanced diet, and even if you do have a balanced diet, you can still have nutritional deficiencies.\"\\n\\nThe Natural Products Association is the largest trade organization representing the manufacturers and retailers of the natural products industry, including vitamins.\\n\\nThe vitamin and supplement industry rakes in nearly $12 billion annually, according to the researchers, with multivitamins its most popular product.\\n\\n\"Multivitamins address the nutritional deficiencies in people,\" Welch said. \"We don\\'t believe they are the answer to all life\\'s ailments, as the editorial suggests.\"\\n\\nMiller, however, disagreed that the studies didn\\'t represent the general public.\\n\\n\"They didn\\'t select people who eat good diets or bad diets,\" he said. \"You assume that these people selected are the typical American diet. Taking a supplement in place of a poor diet doesn\\'t work.\"\\n\\nSome groups, however, do need supplements, he said.\\n\\n\"For people with deficiencies, malabsorption issues, and to prevent neural tube defects in pregnancy -- there are a small number of conditions where we prescribe them.\"\\n\\nMiller also said the jury is still out on Vitamin D, which can help strengthen bones, and omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA and EPA.\\n\\nMiller said the studies were unlikely to change any clinical standards, and that focusing on diet and exercise remain key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\\n\\nIt\\'s something with which Block can agree. \"Eat fruits and vegetables,\" she said.',\n",

       " 'Harold Pollack is a professor at the University of Chicago.H e is the co-author, with Helaine Olen, of \"The Index Card: Why Personal Finance Doesn\\'t Have to be Complicated.\"\\n\\nSixty-five years ago, America faced the challenge of a snarling demagogue, who captured the imagination of millions by fusing legitimate fears of an external enemy with the cultural, regional and demographic resentments of people who disliked the changing nature of our postwar country. Then, as now, a demagogue could draw upon widespread weariness with imperfect and occasionally complacent liberal leaders, important or petty security scandals, the grind of military stalemate in an inconclusive long war.\\n\\nThen, as now, the demagogue benefited from apologists and enablers who privately wanted him defeated, but who would not take risks or bear political costs to openly confront him. Then, as now, his political adversaries were divided and hesitant in their efforts to formulate an effective response. Then, as now, parts of the Republican Party gave a vicious demagogue a congenial political home.\\n\\nOf course, history doesn’t repeat itself. Donald Trump is no Joe McCarthy. For one thing, President Eisenhower and other Republican gatekeepers never allowed McCarthy near their party’s nomination for president. For another, America is a far more cosmopolitan and diverse nation today than it was at the close of the Korean War.\\n\\n[Is Trump dishonest — or too honest? Democrats had better decide.]\\n\\nBut history does sometimes rhyme. The Democratic National Convention brought an unexpected echo of the McCarthy era. The occasion was a speech by the 65-year-old immigration lawyer Khizr Khan, of Charlottesville, Va. Khan’s son Humayun, a posthumously decorated Army captain, was killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq. The elder Khan immigrated in 1980. He has spent more than half of his life in the U.S. His oldest son founded a biotech company where his younger son now works.\\n\\nKhan brought instead his personal eloquence, and his proud memories of a deceased son. In six minutes, the grieving father delivered the blistering response Donald Trump deserved: Khan dispatched Trump’s bluster with an anger made more powerful by its lack of political artifice or the usual focus-grouped finish.*\\n\\n“Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery?” he asked. “Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.”\\n\\nKhan’s words call to mind another unexpected moment from more than 60 years ago, when another dignified lawyer rebuked Sen. Joe McCarthy.\\n\\nJoe Welch, a lifelong Republican, was special counsel to the army and a partner at Hale and Dore. He was sitting in on a hearing about special treatment for a McCarthy aide. McCarthy was on the defensive, and he lashed out. On live TV, the senator accused Fred Fischer, Welch’s young associate, of belonging to a “Communist front organization,” the National Lawyers Guild.\\n\\nWelch drew blood from McCarthy with his famous question: “Have you no sense of decency, sir?”\\n\\nThe question answered itself. It emboldened McCarthy’s enemies and gave new reasons for McCarthy’s prior defenders to move on. Welch cut through a national debate powered by fears of secret enemies in our midst. He called attention to McCarthy’s cruelty toward a single sympathetic person. In these early days of television, millions of Americans watched it live, and had never seen anything quite like it.\\n\\nKhan’s genuine anger — “You have sacrificed nothing and no one” — provided an equally unexpected, electrifying moment. In every way, the Khan family rebuts Trump’s snarling rhetoric. Their life story puts the lie to the anti-immigrant demagoguery that bubbles over this election year.\\n\\n[How the white working class lost its patriotism]\\n\\nLike McCarthy, Donald Trump did not seem chastened by the exchange. When New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd asked him about Khan’s speech, Trump replied, “I’d like to hear his wife say something.” On ABC, Trump added: “His wife, if you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say.”\\n\\nThe ugly intimations are plain enough. For the record, Mrs. Khan participated in a heartbreaking MSNBC interview describing her grief at the loss of her son. She also thanked America for “listening to my husband’s and my heart.” And on July 31, she wrote an opinion piece for The Washington Post.\\n\\nLike McCarthy, Trump derives political advantage from sheer shamelessness, his willingness to wildly attack others. Yet shamelessness creates vulnerabilities and blind spots, too. Trump’s words betray a strange, indecency toward two Gold Star parents grieving the loss of their son.\\n\\nMillions of voters are tempted to embrace sweeping rhetoric directed against Muslim Americans and other minorities. That’s a reality of American life. But these attacks lose their potency when they’re directed not against abstraction but particular, sympathetic human beings. Americans saw for themselves that Khizr Khan is the better man, the better American, than Donald Trump ever will be.\\n\\nA version of this article appeared on SameFact. It’s been updated to reflect that Khan did bring a written speech to the convention and that it was loaded into the teleprompter.',\n",

       " 'If Donald Trump has shown anything during his first eleven days in office, it\\'s that he\\'s a coward with no ideas of his own, who is more than happy to be a puppet for the true president of the United States: Steve Bannon. Sure, Trump acts like he\\'s in charge, but that\\'s because he\\'s too dumb to realize that Bannon is so obviously pulling the strings that he\\'s become a joke. A real, impressive winner (not a Fake! Sad! Loser! like Trump) would recognize he\\'s being manipulated by a power-hungry jackass who is actively trying to destroy the founding principles of this nation. And what\\'s truly crazy is that that statement isn\\'t even slightly hyperbolic.\\n\\nTrump\\'s America Politics News & Culture Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s Closest Adviser, Just Wants to See the World Burn A tale of two terrifying quotes.\\n\\nSteve Bannon is making far-reaching and unprecedented decisions in this White House and is undermining the basic checks and balances that you learned about in junior-high civics class. For example, he was the architect of Donald Trump\\'s horrific \"Don\\'t call it a Muslim ban even though I call it a Muslim ban\" Muslim ban, and when the Department of Homeland Security\\'s lawyers concluded that the ban should not include people who hold green cards, Steve Bannon apparently personally overruled them.\\n\\nAnd, as if that weren\\'t enough, in an unprecedented move, Steve Bannon has been appointed to the National Security Council even as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence were demoted. And lest you think this isn\\'t a big deal, take *The New York Times’*s word for it:\\n\\n...who sits at the National Security Council table when the administration debates issues of war and peace can make a real difference in decisions. In giving Mr. Bannon an official role in national security policy making, Mr. Trump has not simply broken with tradition but has embraced the risk of politicizing national security, or giving the impression of doing so.\\n\\nSo now, a man who is a political animal and an amoral opportunist, who years ago said that his goal is to \"destroy the state\" and \"bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment,” is now going to be an even bigger voice in shaping U.S. foreign policy. And lest you think he\\'s changed his mind since then, here\\'s what he said YESTERDAY to The Washington Post about attorney general nominee and noted racist Jeff Sessions.\\n\\n“Throughout the campaign, Sessions has been the fiercest, most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump’s agenda, and has played a critical role as the clearinghouse for policy and philosophy to undergird the implementation of that agenda. What we are witnessing now is the birth of a new political order, and the more frantic a handful of media elites become, the more powerful that new political order becomes itself.”\\n\\nHe\\'s casually throwing around phrases like \"new political order\" as if they aren\\'t terrifying when paired with him running roughshod over the rights of...well, everyone who isn\\'t a rich, white, straight male. And if you still think Trump is actually in control, here\\'s what Bannon said of his so-called boss last year:\\n\\n\"[Donald Trump is a] blunt instrument for us,” he told me earlier this summer. “I don’t know whether he really gets it or not.”\\n\\nSo there you have it. A man who wants to \"destroy the state\" and who basically bragged that he was manipulating Trump to his own ends has already, in only eleven days, risen to an unprecedented level of influence for someone in his position. He\\'s already overruled entire departments of government and unseated qualified security experts on the NSC. So we should get some slimy photos of Steve Bannon ready for those junior-high civics classrooms. After all, they usually have photos of the presidents on their walls.\\n\\nAn Apology:',\n",
       " 'Roger Joseph Zelazny was born on May 13, 1937 in Euclid, Ohio, USA.\\n\\nRoger Zelazny made his first experiences as a writer in school magazines. He received a Bachelor of Arts in English at the Western Reserve University in 1959 and a Master of Arts in 1962. He also won the Finley Foster Poetry Prize and the Holden Essay Award for some of his poetry.\\n\\nInitially, his career as a writer was part time writing short fiction and only in 1965 a cut version of his novel “.. . And Call Me Conrad ” was published in “The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction”. In 1966 the novel was published as an integral version as a book with the title “This Immortal”. The novel won the Hugo Award.\\n\\n“This Immortal” contains some of the most typical themes of Roger Zelazny’s works with the presence of characters who are god-like or at least supehuman. There’s also the inspiration to mythology, in this case Greek, but in his works the author used elements of mythologies from all over the world and even the Cthulhu Mythos.\\n\\nIn 1965 Roger Zelazny also published the novella “He Who Shapes”, winner of the Nebula Award, which was expanded into the novel “The Dream Master” in 1966. In 1967 Roger Zelazny published the novel “Lord of Light”, who won the Hugo Award.\\n\\nAfter a few years, his achievements convinced Roger Zelazny to devote himself full time to being a writer. In 1969 he published the novels “Isle of the Dead”, winner of the Prix Tour-Apollo Award in France, and “Damnation Alley”, another expansion of a novella.\\n\\nIn 1970 Roger Zelazny published the first book of his fantasy cycle of the Chronicles of Amber “Nine Princes in Amber”. The first five books, published in the 1970s, describe the adventures of Prince Corwin of Amber and are for this reason also called the Corwin series.\\n\\nDuring the 1970s Roger Zelazny kept on publishing science fiction stories as well, winning the Hugo and Nebula awards for the novella “Home is the Hangman”. In 1976 he published the novel written in collaboration with Philip K. Dick “Deus Irae”.\\n\\nThe 1980s brought other successes to Roger Zelazny, in both the science fiction and fantasy genres. His 1981 novelette “Unicorn Variation” won the Hugo Award. His 1981 novel “The Changing Land” won the Locus Fantasy Award. His 1985 novella “24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai” won the Hugo Award. His 1986 novelette “Permafrost” won the Hugo Award.\\n\\nIn 1985, Roger Zelazny published the first book of the Merlin series, which includes the other five books of the Chronicles of Amber focused on the adventures of Corwin’s son. It’s “The Trumps of Doom”, winner of the Locus Fantasy Award.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, Roger Zelazny completed the Chronicles of Amber and published some works written in collaboration such as “Bring Me the Head of the Prince Charmingt” in 1991, “If at Faust You Don’t Succeed” in 1993 and “A Farce to be Reckoned With” in 1995, a humorous fantasy mini-cycle written with Robert Sheckley.\\n\\nRoger Zelazny died on June 14, 1995 because of a cancer that also caused him kidney failure. Some works were published posthumously such as “Psycoshop” in 1998, a novel started by Alfred Bester. After reaching success, Zelazny increased the amount of works published, not always maintaining the same quality. However, several of his works are still among those considered memorable in both science fiction and fantasy genres.',\n",
       " 'Thor: Ragnarok (In cinemas 26 October 2017)\\n\\nThis movie needs to span from the end of Age of Ultron until the start of Infinity War. Im not joking. Thor is going to be a busy boy.\\n\\nWe know a few things to start this journey, most notably is that Thor is on his own side quest to find out what the deal is with the Infinity Stones. I can’t imagine how this is going to go well without Odin’s help, and as we know from the end of the last Thor movie, The Dark World, Odin isn’t exactly himself at the moment. This lack of knowledge on Odin’s (read: Loki’s) part will be what triggers Thor into realising the trickery going on. The whole Stone deal will also be what gets Loki to tag along with his brother – the only person who Loki can actually trust to keep him safe from Thanos’ rage, considering the end of the first Avengers movie.\\n\\nAll of this, however, does nothing to resolve the overall question of where Odin is, and has been, since Loki deposed him. What little I’ve seen of the set pics and the bits and pieces of marketing seem to imply that Odin is on Earth. I guess it’s the last place Thor would look? I dunno, who wants to try work out how Loki’s mind works. Anyway, Loki has probably lost track of his father, given the time and effort he’d have to give to ruling Asgard, which is why he and Thor visit the good Doctor Strange. Well, I guess its’ going to be mostly Thor doing the visiting, considering Loki is a bad guy and Strange probably doesn’t care for his sort.\\n\\nChanging tack a little bit, the start of the movie will have the traditional thing where we start hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years in the past and will detail the basics of Hela, and her imprisonment, or banishment or whatever it is they call it. Something something Ragnarok prophecy. Something Surtur. Something Odin dies.\\n\\nSeriously, though, I don’t know how this is going to go down. This is going to be a busy movie, and I haven’t even got to the part where Thor takes his little trip yet.\\n\\nLet’s see. In his last act as King of Asgard, Loki releases Hela from her bonds; call it his insurance policy. Allowing her to leave Hel and move about the realms freely. While on Earth, looking for Odin, Hela destroys Mjolnir, kills Odin (which sends him to Valhalla) and sends Thor to Hel. Sure, let’s go with that.\\n\\nPotentially unknown to Hela, the death of Odin triggers Ragnarok, releasing Surtur and starting that whole thing. Meanwhile, Thor is trying to escape Hel and ends up on Sakaar. The backwater planet. Where everything eventually ends up, like <insert your favourite place to pick on here>. From here, Valkyrie takes him to Jeff Goldblum, who is playing Jeff Goldblum again. Jeff pits him against TIH because thats gonna be awesome to watch. Thor hits Hulk enough to make Bruce fall out and the two of them make their way back to whats left of Asgard.\\n\\nThor fights Hela, resealing her in Hel. Hulk fights Surtur, resealing him back where he belongs and Asgard is destroyed, in its entirety.\\n\\nRagnarok, however, generally implies a rebirth. A starting again. In the comics, after the Ragnarok event a few years back, Asgard ended up floating above a town in Oklahoma. I predict something like that happening in the MCU after this movie.\\n\\nWhich brings us, almost neatly, to the end. But lets not forget that this is supposed to lead directly into Infinity War. So how does it do that? While Asgard may indeed be on Earth after the dust has settled, that doesnt mean Thor will be. He and Big Green will be let loose upon the stars somehow which will get them picked up by The Milano. Now, I dont think the Guardians will be in Ragnarok, but there will be some explicit thing which lets the audience know thats what happens. Maybe as the screen cuts to black and the credits start, we hear Hooked on A Feeling? I dunno. Something like that.\\n\\nAfter credits scenes. Obviously the first one will be the “trailer” to Infinity War. Potentially the teaser that was shown at the conventions earlier in the year, maybe a series of small scenes from the movie itself. Something along those lines. While the second will be similar to most other ones, showing an epilogue of sorts to the movie itself. Maybe Sam Neill’s character? Perhaps Surtur and Dormammu talking? A hint at the future of the Thor franchise, while maintaining a level of silliness and not-real-relevance.',\n",

(Photo: Mykal_McEldowney/Indy_Star) Story Highlights Pacers at Lakers, 10:30 p.m. Friday, Fox Sports Indiana & ESPN\\n\\nLarry Bird knew he was not doing Myles Turner a favor. Bird, the Indiana Pacers’ team president, felt Turner, the 20-year-old phenom, needed to be the team’s starting center after last season ended.\\n\\nYet Bird knew that meant the Pacers’ youngest player would be asked to bang in the paint with the biggest, fiercest and toughness players in the NBA. Turner, as the Pacers reached the midway point of the season in their win Wednesday over the Sacramento Kings, has accepted the challenge.\\n\\nOne of the biggest reasons Bird is optimistic about the second half of the Pacers’ season is that Turner is starting to thrive in his new role.\\n\\n“You forget the fact that he’s a young man playing in a men’s league,” Bird said of Turner in telephone interview Friday. “I always say throwing that kid out there – what I did to him this year – is really unheard of. His body is not mature for where it’s going to be in a couple years. You’re our starting center. Go out and get Dwight Howard. That’s a tough assignment. The other night, playing against DeMarcus (Cousins), probably the best big man in the league. Those are tough chores, but the kid doesn’t back down.”\\n\\nTurner had one of his best defensive halves of the season Wednesday, guarding Cousins well enough in the second half for the Pacers to rally from a 22-point deficit. Turner also scored 16 points and collected five rebounds.\\n\\nIn 40 games this season, Turner is averaging 15.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per game. He is shooting 52.9 percent from the field and an impressive 42.9 percent behind the arc.\\n\\n“He plays hard,” Bird said of Turner. “He works hard. He wants to be great. He’s going to be great. To me, I think he’s got a chance to be one of the best players or maybe the best player (in the franchise’s history). You’ve still Paul (George) with a bunch of time left, too, and you had Reggie (Miller) here with all the other great ones. But being a 20-year-old and doing what this kid is doing just blows my mind.”\\n\\nIndiana Pacers president Larry Bird fields questions from reporters during their season ending press conference Friday Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The Pacers finished the season 38-44 and missed the playoffs. (Photo: Matt Kryger / The Star)\\n\\nBird emphasized that the Pacers are still led by George, the team’s perennial All-Star small forward. But Bird believes Turner will continue to mature and grow playing alongside George and Jeff Teague.\\n\\nAlthough Turner has played in just 100 career regular season games, Bird expects Turner and George to become a more formidable duo in the future.\\n\\n“He’s still playing with Paul George and Paul gets a little frustrated at him at times, but night-in and night-out that kid battles you,” Bird said. “With his work ethic, his desire, his mentality to be great, I think the future is unbelievable for that young man.”\\n\\nBird is among many in the NBA who have been impressed with Turner’s rapid development.\\n\\n“Turner is going to be a superstar,” Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers said in December. “I think no one will argue that. In fact, it will probably happen quicker than any of us thought. He’s special.”\\n\\nGeorge said his teammate was one of “the best up-and-coming talents in the league” in July after the after Turner participated in the USA Basketball camp as a member of the USA Select team that helped train George and the rest of the national team for the Olympics.\\n\\nBird, who was a Hall of Fame player with the Boston Celtics, was known for his tireless workouts. He called Turner a relentless worker. Bird is eager to see how much Turner improves in terms of his strength and understanding of how to be an elite rebounder.\\n\\nNEWSLETTERS Get the IndyStar Motor Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong The latest news in IndyCar and the world of motor sports.

       " 'Punctual trams run quietly along the street out front. It looks like any other office building in Zürich. But inside the nondescript building of SIX Interbank Clearing, a small unit of professionals maintains the list of the world’s currency codes.\\n\\nLast week in that very same building, I had the honor of presenting the bitcoin cryptocurrency to a gathered audience of various bank officials at an e-commerce conference. And I mentioned that the individual, or committee, that endorses and finalizes XBT as the ISO currency code for bitcoin will earn their spot in history next to Satoshi Nakamoto.\\n\\nOf course, a new code for a brand new asset class is not comparable to an achievement in financial cryptography and distributed consensus, but it is significant nonetheless because of its impact on the evolution of math-based currencies.\\n\\nThe ISO 4217 standard for currency codes is published by a voluntary, non-governmental organization independent of any national agenda. It operates more or less as a body that approves the three-character currency codes of new countries or regions. In some cases, the code reflects a non-governmental unit such as gold (XAU) and silver (XAG).\\n\\nBeyond the regulations and government approval that so frequently underpin discussions about the legitimacy of bitcoin, a different type of legitimacy is emerging and it has the ability to out-survive the elected administrations of legal jurisdictions.\\n\\nThis market-based legitimacy holds the key to bitcoin’s success – not the sanctions and official blessings for what’s an appropriate monetary unit. Governments and regulators may come and go, but customs and convention persevere.\\n\\nCurrency code XBT is a sign of this growing market-based influence, at least among the organizations currently depending on such codes. Governments generally follow rather than lead market adoption because it is too difficult to alter the course of momentum.\\n\\nUniquely, bitcoin operates as both a value transfer network and a separate unit of account. Therefore, it doesn’t require the services of a third-party intermediary to approve and route transactions. However, as a monetary unit, bitcoin offers great opportunities for those who desire to trade or price in bitcoin and perhaps layering services on top of the protocol.\\n\\nAt the top of the pyramid is SWIFT, a member-owned cooperative that provides the communication platform to connect more than 10,000 banking organizations in 210 countries (16 more countries than the United Nations).\\n\\nSWIFT’s influence is so pervasive that its ecosystem is a daily barometer of global economic performance such as GDP growth rates, capital flows, and foreign exchange trade volatility.\\n\\nOnce again, bitcoin is a major topic of conversation at Sibos, the annual SWIFT conference being held in Dubai this year.\\n\\nIn prepared remarks yesterday, SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt said, “I would not see why we at Swift could not send transactions in bitcoin as a currency.” If they do, they will undoubtedly look to the ISO for the currency code. The Bitcoin Foundation had two scheduled appearances at the SWIFT conference.\\n\\nAlso, the payment networks like VISA, MasterCard, and American Express all rely on the ISO 4217 codes for international transactions and currency conversion. Once the member banks start requesting settlement in bitcoin for certain transactions, the payment networks will look to the ISO for the corresponding currency code.\\n\\nXE.com, one of the world’s leading providers of Internet foreign exchange tools and services, recently began displaying bitcoin prices in XBT across their data feed. Founded in 1993, the company licenses over 35,000 XE Currency Converters, provides commercial currency data to over 1,000 clients, and serves 18 million unique users per month.\\n\\nService provider OANDA also displays bitcoin prices using the currency code XBT. OANDA is a market maker and a trusted source for currency data, serving both individuals and financial institutions. Founded in 1995, it provides access to one of the world’s largest historical, high frequency, filtered currency databases serving over 30 million requests per month.\\n\\nNot to be outdone, Bloomberg in August announced that they were testing XBT price quotes internally lending more ammunition to the push for formal code adoption.\\n\\nIn the bitcoin trading world, exchange operator Kraken became the first to make the formal switch to XBT this week and other bitcoin exchanges are expected to follow suit.\\n\\nIn the retail foreign exchange trading world, platform market leaders like MetaTrader 4 are witnessing client firms undertaking the bitcoin modifications on their own. Although not expressing trades in XBT yet, the gradual adoption of bitcoin into existing forex platforms signals a huge shift in market trading. So far, only three companies are known to have incorporated bitcoin into the MT4 environment, including AvaTrade, BTC-E, and Bit4X.\\n\\nXBT may represent the beginning for bitcoin standards and market-based legitimacy, but it is certainly not the end. Next up on the standards agenda is the Unicode symbol for bitcoin with B⃦ or ฿ as the two leading contenders.\\n\\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, CoinDesk.\\n\\nFollow author on Twitter.',\n",
       " 'The Grammy Award-winning Atlanta Symphony Orchestra (ASO) has canceled its concerts until Nov. 8, following a breakdown in contract negotiations between musicians’ union and management, and the resulting lockout of musicians.\\n\\nMusicians were locked out of Woodruff Arts Center in Atlanta, Ga. on Sept. 7, according to a statement from Paul Murphy, President of Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Players Association (ASOPA), which was posted to the Atlanta Federation of Musicians’ Facebook page.\\n\\nThe symphony’s 70th anniversary season was set to begin on Sept. 25. Instead of performing, the musicians staged a silent protest across from the arts center.\\n\\n“This is a dire and critical juncture for the city of Atlanta, which is in danger of losing the flagship of its culture,” said ASO Music Director, Robert Spano in a piece titled “Deafening Silence” on his website.\\n\\nThe contract between Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Players’ Association expired on Sept. 6, as the two groups could not agree on new terms, according to The New York Times ArtsBeat blog.\\n\\nThe two parties disagreed on terms relating to salary cuts, health benefit contributions and the orchestra’s configuration, among others. The ASO website provides a Q&A section, which details the situation and its impact.\\n\\nThe ASO has been operating with a deficit for the past 12 years.\\n\\nWhile the two parties could not agree on the terms of the new contract, they do agree that a lack of public arts funding is a factor contributing to the nationwide trend of financial woes for symphonies and opera companies.\\n\\nMayor of Atlanta, Kasim Reed said in a statement on Thursday that he urged both sides to return to the bargaining table, realizing that the ASO’s financial solvency and musical excellence are intertwined, not opposing forces.”\\n\\n“A protracted lockout is not good for the ASO and not good for Atlanta,” he said.\\n\\nGeorgia’s arts funding is about 6 cents per capita compared to the national average of 87 cents. The state occupies the 50th position on the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies (NASAA) funding list. On its website, the ASO claims that this lack of funding is exacerbating its financial challenges.\\n\\nAmong the musicians rising up in solidarity with Atlanta Symphony musicians on the web and over social media are the Minnesota Orchestra Musicians, who endured a 16-month lockout in 2010-2011 and the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra Musicians, whose members were locked out of the Hilbert Circle Theatre for one month in 2012.\\n\\nMusicians of the New York Philharmonic sent $10,000 to ASO musicians to show their support and New York’s MET Orchestra Musicians, who voted to authorize a strike in May of this year when it looked like contract negotiations would fall apart ahead of the July 31 expiration date, posted “How You Can Help the ATL Symphony“.\\n\\nThe musicians’ union and ASO management will return to the bargaining table with the help of a federal mediator – the same mediator who handled the Metropolitan Opera negotiations in August – according to a Sept. 27 post on the ASO Facebook page.',\n",

However, one of the reasons I keep food blogging, and connecting online is about the sincere community that I have experienced.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s gone.

Jennifer touched base online in the next few days with her thoughts and on her blog ( In Jennie\\'s Kitchen ) with her story of love and pain. In the midst of her own challenges of coping with loss and her two young daughters, she drew the online community to her table. She fed us with inspiration and example.

       " 'Photo\\n\\nDoctor and Patient Dr. Pauline Chen on medical care.\\n\\nNot long ago, I attended a meeting on the future of primary care. Most of the physicians in the room knew one another, so the discussion, while serious, remained relaxed.\\n\\nToward the end of the hour, one of the physicians who had been mostly silent cleared his throat and raised his hand to speak. The other physicians smiled in acknowledgment as their colleague stood up.\\n\\n“Nurse practitioners,” he said. “Maybe we need more nurse practitioners in primary care.”\\n\\nSmiles faded, faces froze and the room fell silent. An outraged doctor, the color in his face rising, stood to bellow at his impertinent colleague. Others joined the fray and side arguments erupted in the back of the room. A couple of people raised their hands to try to bring the meeting back to order, but it was too late.\\n\\nThe physician had mentioned the unmentionable.\\n\\nI remembered the discord and chaos of that meeting when I read a recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine of nurses’ and physicians’ opinions about primary care providers.\\n\\nFor several years now, health care experts have been issuing warnings about an impending severe shortfall of primary care physicians. Policy makers have suggested that nurse practitioners, nurses who have completed graduate-level studies and up to 700 additional hours of supervised clinical work, could fill the gap.\\n\\nAlready, many of these advanced-practice nurses work as their patients’ principal provider. They make diagnoses, prescribe medications and order and perform diagnostic tests. And since they are reimbursed less than physicians, policy makers are quick to point out, increasing the number of nurse practitioners could lower health care costs.\\n\\nIf only it were that easy.\\n\\nThree years ago, a national panel of experts recommended that nurses be able to practice “to the full extent of their education and training,” leading medical teams and practices, admitting patients to hospitals and being paid at the same rate as physicians for the same work. But physician organizations opposed many of the specific suggestions, citing a lack of data or well-designed studies to support the recommendations.\\n\\nIn an effort to build consensus, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation then invited a dozen leaders from national physician and nursing groups to discuss their differences. The hope was that face-to-face discussions would help physicians and nurses understand one another better and see beyond the highly charged and emotional rhetoric. The approach worked, at least initially; after three meetings, the group drafted a report filled with suggestions for reconciling many of the differences.\\n\\nBut an early confidential draft was leaked to the American Medical Association, a group that had not been invited to participate, and the A.M.A. immediately expressed its opposition to the report. Soon after, three of the participating medical organizations — the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Osteopathic Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics — withdrew their support, and the effort to bring physicians and nurse practitioners together and complete the report collapsed.\\n\\nNonetheless, many health care experts remained confident, believing that the large professional organizations had grown out of touch with grass-roots-level health care providers. The guilds might oppose one another, but every day in medical practices, clinics and hospitals across the country, physicians and nurse practitioners were working side by side without bickering. Surely, the experts reasoned, providers who knew and liked one another would be receptive to trying new ways of working together.\\n\\nWrong.\\n\\nAnalyzing questionnaires completed by almost 1,000 physicians and nurse practitioners, researchers did find that almost all of the doctors and nurses believed that nurse practitioners should be able to practice to the full extent of their training and that their inclusion in primary care would improve the timeliness of and access to care.\\n\\nBut the agreement ended there. Nurse practitioners believed that they could lead primary care practices and admit patients to a hospital and that they deserved to earn the same amount as doctors for the same work. The physicians disagreed. Many of the doctors said that they provided higher-quality care than their nursing counterparts and that increasing the number of nurse practitioners in primary care would not necessarily improve safety, effectiveness, equity or quality.\\n\\nA third of the doctors went so far as to state that nurse practitioners would have a detrimental effect on the safety and effectiveness of care.\\n\\n“These are not just professional differences,” said Karen Donelan, the lead author of the study and a senior scientist at the Mongan Institute for Health Policy at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. “This is an interplanetary gulf,” she said, echoing a point in an editorial that accompanied her study.\\n\\nThe findings bode poorly for future policy efforts, since physicians are unlikely to support efforts to increase the responsibilities and numbers of advanced-practice nurses in primary care. And most nurse practitioners are unlikely to support any proposals to expand their roles that do not include equal pay for equal work.\\n\\nPeter I. Buerhaus, senior author of the study and a professor of nursing at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, is chairman of a commission created almost three years ago under the Affordable Care Act to address health care work force issues. But his group has yet to convene because a divided Congress has not approved White House requests for funding.\\n\\n“We’re running out of time on these issues,” Dr. Buerhaus said. “If the staffing differences remain unresolved, we are just going to cause harm to the public.”\\n\\nStill, by providing a clearer picture of the extent of these professional differences, the study should help future efforts. “It’s too easy to say that everyone should just get along,” Dr. Donelan said. “These arguments touch on the whole nature of these professions, their core values and how they define themselves.”\\n\\n“It’s like when family members are warring over a sick patient,” she added. “We need first to acknowledge the others’ position and the full extent of our differences before we can reach any kind of resolution.”',\n",
       " 'Hyundai has entered into an agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) to resolve the government’s investigation of its 2012 restatement of fuel economy ratings. This settlement does not have any impact on Hyundai customers.\\n\\nThe Backstory\\n\\nOn November 2, 2012, Hyundai announced the voluntary adjustment of fuel economy ratings for approximately one-quarter of our 2011-13 model year vehicles, reducing their combined city/highway fuel economy by 1-2 miles per gallon (mpg), and relabeled affected vehicles still in dealer showrooms. In order to compensate affected customers, Hyundai provided a lifetime reimbursement program to cover the additional fuel costs associated with the rating change plus a 15 percent premium in acknowledgement of the inconvenience. The majority of customers affected by the ratings restatement enrolled in the automaker’s reimbursement program and are being compensated based on their actual mileage and the fuel costs for the region in which they live.\\n\\nLeaders in Fuel Economy\\n\\nIt’s important to note that even with our adjusted fuel economy ratings, Hyundai continues to lead the automotive industry in fuel efficiency and environmental performance.

       " 'The Kel-Tec RFB (Rifle, Forward-ejection, Bullpup)[4] is a gas-operated bullpup type semi-automatic rifle, manufactured by Kel-Tec Industries of Florida. At the 2008 SHOT Show held from February 2 to 5 in Las Vegas, Nevada it was declared by Kel-Tec representatives that the RFB rifle would be made available to the public by the 4th quarter of 2008. Later, the Kel-Tec website stated that the 18 in (460 mm) barrel carbine variant would not be shipping until February 2009 due to a change in the production process intended as preventative measures against potential gun control legislation.[5] The rifle first shipped to distributors in the first week of March 2009 and was first seen at the 2007 SHOT Show.[1]\\n\\nDesign details [ edit ]\\n\\nThe RFB is a semi-automatic firearm chambered for 7.62×51mm NATO/.308 Winchester ammunition. The RFB uses metric FAL magazines,[6] which insert straight into the magazine well and do not need to rock into place. It has a short-stroke gas piston operating system.[7] The rifle uses a patented forward-ejection system via a tube placed over the barrel that ejects the spent case forwards, over the handguard of the rifle. Extraction is accomplished by two extractors, each with two axes of rotation. The extractors may move side-to-side to engage the rim of the case, and pivot upwards to extract the spent case after firing. Empty cases remain in the ejection chute[3] until either the weapon is tilted downwards, the charging handle is operated, or they are pushed out by following cases. Cases drop gently from this chute to the left of the barrel.[1] To avoid sloppy trigger pull typical of firearms modified into bullpups, the RFB uses a floating linkage bar between the sear and the hammer, allowing the sear to remain above the trigger.[8] The weapon is fully ambidextrous,[9] much in the style of the Belgian F2000 rifle. The RFB is delivered without iron sights.[10] A mil-spec Picatinny rail is provided for mounting a wide range of optics and tactical accessories.[8]\\n\\nThe barrel of the RFB is not fully free floated, it instead serves as the rigid \"spine\" of the weapon, to which all other components are attached (either directly or through other components).\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kel-Tec has introduced similar bullpup rifles in 5.56mm called the RDB and the M43, released in 2014.[11]\\n\\nVariants [ edit ]\\n\\nKel-Tec has produced at least four versions with differing barrel lengths, weight, overall length, and performance:\\n\\nCarbine with an 18 in (460 mm) barrel,\\n\\nwith an 18 in (460 mm) barrel, Sporter variant with 24 in (610 mm) length barrel,\\n\\nvariant with 24 in (610 mm) length barrel, Target version with either a heavy profile 32 in (810 mm) barrel or 26 in (660 mm) stainless steel barrel, and\\n\\nversion with either a heavy profile 32 in (810 mm) barrel or 26 in (660 mm) stainless steel barrel, and RFB-C with an 18.5 in (470 mm) barrel meeting the Canadian requirement for non-restricted rifles, exclusively for export to Canada.[12]\\n\\nThe Target version also features a five-way adjustable trigger, for a trigger pull from 2 to 6 lb f (8.9 to 26.7 N). As of 2013, all four variants have been publicly released for sale.[citation needed]\\n\\nSee also [ edit ]\\n\\nReferences [ edit ]',\n",
       " 'San Antonio FC has continued to get the job done, extending their undefeated streak, all be it in unspectacular fashion as they managed a scoreless draw against Oklahoma City Energy FC at Taft Stadium on Saturday night.\\n\\nThe result takes San Antonio FC’s undefeated streak to 13 matches, and extends goalkeeper Diego Restrepo’s clean sheet streak to seven matches. Restrepo now has gone over 10 hours of play without conceding a goal, but the team is still struggling at the other end of the park.\\n\\nSan Antonio FC head coach Darren Powell was pleased with another clean sheet after the match saying “That makes seven clean sheets in a row, which is something that takes a lot of hard work and effort from every player. There’s a lot to build on and we earned another point on the road, and now we look to keep improving week after week.”\\n\\nIn truth there was little for either keeper to do in the match with just a combined shots on target mark of three. Two of those fell to Oklahoma City Energy as Restrepo was able to make two fairly comfortable saves.\\n\\n“It’s good to keep getting clean sheets and giving our team a chance to earn at least a point every match.” Said Restrepo, “it’s great to continue recording shutouts but the important thing is to come away with results, and now we just have to keep improving.”\\n\\nAgain the San Antonio defense was impressive as they held out the Energy blocking two shots. San Antonio FC again lost the possession battle, but just barely, but they were rarely troubled thanks to a strong defensive performance, with Stephen McCarthy particularly impressive, making nine clearances and intercepting two passes.\\n\\nThe continued lack of finishing touch will worry San Antonio FC, who for the second straight week were able to create chances but not put any of them away. That will concern Powell at least slightly, but despite frustration up front\\n\\nAdvertisements',\n",

       " 'ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nHillary Clinton has a fundamental problem going into the general election against Donald Trump — as well as a fundamental opportunity.\\n\\nThe problem is that people think they know Clinton, and the person they know is someone they don\\'t like — and, much more important, don\\'t trust. Voters don\\'t trust Trump either — but he\\'s the new flavor, and has the advantage if he is allowed to define the contest as a referendum on Clinton and the status quo.\\n\\nBefore that happens, Clinton needs to define herself for this election, in terms that reflect who she really is, but in a positive way, and that connect emotionally with the electorate at large and, especially, with the segment of the Romney coalition where Trump may be most vulnerable: married white women. The opportunity to do that is rapidly approaching. The time to strike is right after she secures the nomination, and does what she needs to do behind the scenes to bring Bernie Sanders back into the fold. That\\'s the point where people will be listening to her for the first time as the leader of her party. That\\'s her chance to tell them who she is.\\n\\nSo who is she? What is the \"best version\" of Hillary Clinton, in terms of being able to connect to the public emotionally, establishing a strong and effective contrast with Donald Trump, and also being authentic to who she really is?\\n\\nI find it useful in doing this kind of exercise to try to distill the answer down to the simplest terms possible. A single sentence — or even better, a single descriptive word.\\n\\nFor my money, Hillary Clinton\\'s single word is: LOYAL.\\n\\nNow, I can already hear folks on the left laughing. \"Loyal\" is your word for the authentic Hillary Clinton? The woman who betrayed her mentor, Marian Wright Edelman? Hey, who do you think she\\'s loyal to — Goldman Sachs?\\n\\nBut last I checked, welfare reform was signed not by her, but by her husband. Last I checked, Glass-Steagall was repealed not by her but by her husband.\\n\\nWho do I think she\\'s loyal to? I think she\\'s loyal to him.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the rock on which I propose that she rebuild her emotional connection with married women.\\n\\nThink back to the days of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. What would have happened to Hillary Clinton if she had not stood by her husband, but instead had gone into seclusion? If she\\'d planned her Senate run without him and filed for divorce right after her victory? It\\'s impossible to know, of course, but it\\'s hard to believe that anyone would have held it against her. If she handled it all with grace and class, it could have helped her enormously.\\n\\nWhy didn\\'t she?\\n\\nIt\\'s possible that she just plain loves him. That\\'s what Barney Frank said at the time, and it may be true. It\\'s possible that she was afraid to be without him — afraid, in particular that she couldn\\'t hack it on her own politically. I wouldn\\'t be at all surprised if Bill played on those fears. From the outside, we have no way of knowing the real reason — but I can say that these particular reasons are not particularly helpful to her, politically.\\n\\nBut it\\'s possible that she didn\\'t leave him because that\\'s just not what she does. Because she\\'s someone who sticks, someone who\\'s loyal. And that\\'s a reason that is helpful politically.\\n\\nIt aids her on a personal level. As I have said before, Hillary Clinton does best when people remember that she bleeds. And this was a time when she was cut pretty deep. Also, while people would have sympathized with her as a wronged woman if she had left Bill, I strongly believe that they can also sympathize with her as someone for whom preserving the marriage was just more important than her own hurt feelings. Plenty of women have done the same.\\n\\nIt\\'s also helpful on a political level. \"Pragmatist\" is an ugly word this season, particularly on the Democratic side. Clinton is pretty fully committed to rehabilitating the word — but how do you do it, emotionally? How do you tell a story that makes someone see sacrificing some of your integrity as a positive? A lot of progressives in this election are clearly yearning for someone who is pure. Well, someone who cared about being pure more than being loyal would have left Bill after Monica. But the pure are left alone. Is that where progressives want to be?\\n\\nMeanwhile, if you want to talk about a contrast to Donald Trump, that\\'s the contrast to draw. It\\'s not just that Trump has unceremoniously dumped two wives. He\\'s also blatantly ditched investors, leaving them holding the bag in his multiple business bankruptcies — and then bragged about it afterwards. As a candidate, he switches policy positions minute by minute — and denies having done so even when presented with recorded proof of his prior statements (as, for example, with his supposed opposition to Hillary Clinton\\'s war in Libya).\\n\\nThe point isn\\'t that Trump is a \"flip-flopper\" — someone who moves whatever way the wind blows. Voters might not mind that so much if the wind is blowing their way, or if they think they can blow harder than the wind. The point is that Trump cuts and runs. He\\'s built his career on rolling the dice and leaving somebody else to pay his debts when he comes up snake eyes. And this is the man who we\\'re supposed to believe will now be \"greedy for America?\"\\n\\nThat\\'s not the way Hillary Clinton rolls. It\\'s not just that she\\'s not the type — it\\'s that she knows the type. She is intimately familiar with the type of man who lies, and cheats, and depends on someone else to clean up his messes. She just has to remind us about that part of her life, and we\\'ll make the connection ourselves.\\n\\nAnd once an emotional connection is formed around this word, \"loyal,\" it can be put to use in multiple contexts. Foreign policy is one obvious place. Clinton\\'s hawkishness is almost certainly a net-liability for her, but the best spin that can be put on it is to call her loyal to the commitments America has already made and to the men and women of our armed forces. Meanwhile, the worst spin that can be put on Trump\\'s incoherent ramblings isn\\'t that he\\'s a neo-isolationist, but that he\\'s somebody who will make commitments and abandon them at the drop of a hat, leaving allies and enemies alike bewildered and, frankly, contemptuous.\\n\\nIn domestic policy as well, Clinton ads that read like bragging — I\\'m such a fighter; I work so hard; you should be grateful to have someone like me as your president — can be recast as statements not about how we should feel about her, but how she feels about us. That we\\'re the people she\\'ll be loyal to, now that she\\'s the boss.\\n\\nObviously, she isn\\'t going to want to do this. And it may not be necessary. Consolidating the support of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents after securing the nomination may be enough to restore her lead. Trump could discover that his act plays really well with 30 percent of the population, not so great with 20 percent, and terribly with 50 percent. The economy could get stronger, and Obama could get more popular, giving Clinton a powerful tailwind. Anointed successors to two-term incumbents lost narrowly in 1960, 1968, and 2000, and lost dramatically in 1952 and 2008. But maybe this year will be like 1988, currently the sole post-war exception to the rule.\\n\\nBut Trump is going to go there whether she wants him to or not. He\\'s already calling her an enabler of her husband\\'s misdeeds. Taking the high road and refusing to engage is much better than slinging personal mud back at him — but it can also look haughty and aloof, exacerbating the sense that voters have that Clinton considers herself better than the rest of us. That tack may be a missed opportunity to take the very personal issues that Trump wants to use to attack her and turn them to her advantage, by making her seem both more human and more noble.\\n\\nThis one time, it might be worth it to gamble.\\n\\nThis is the third article in a three-part series. You can read part one here and part two here.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nMason Raymond in his natural habitat.\\n\\nSo Mason Raymond re-signed today, and a fanbase went nuts. But you all know the story. Thom linked to it earlier.\\n\\nAnyway, I don’t think that fans in the Vancouver market truly appreciate shooter regression. Raymond shot at just 8% last season and 7.6% the season before that. Now, there’s reason to believe that “Raymond is just a horrible shooter” but like I showed with my Jason Garrison analysis, even four years doesn’t generally predict how good of a shooter a player is.\\n\\nSo I took the simple route. I looked at five forwards who had a shooting percentage similar to Raymond’s last year from the year 2011. I wanted to compare it with how they did in 2012. Small sample, whatever. Raymond is a small sample himself, and all we want is a general idea of what we can expect out of Raymond.\\n\\nMy five players:\\n\\nRadim Vrbata Patric Hornqvist Matt Hendricks Jannik Hansen Matt Cullen\\n\\nHow did those players do in 2011?\\n\\nGoals/82 Shots/Game Sh% Vrbata 19.7 3.04 7.92% Hornqvist 21.8 3.35 7.92% Hendricks 9.6 1.47 7.96% Hansen 9.0 1.38 7.96% Cullen 12.6 1.92 8.00% All 14.5 2.23 7.95%\\n\\nSo, not too different from Mason Raymond. As a trivial exercise, Raymond had 14.9 goals per 82 games, 2.27 shots per game and a shooting percentage of exactly 8.0%. So he’s pretty much identical to these combined players.\\n\\nHow did those players do the very next season?\\n\\nGoals/82 Shots/Game Sh% Vrbata 37.3 3.01 15.09% Hornqvist 29.1 3.03 11.74% Hendricks 4.2 1.24 4.12% Hansen 16.0 1.67 11.68% Cullen 15.7 2.25 8.54% All 20.4 2.23 11.16%\\n\\nFunny. Shots per game was exactly equal, yet the player’s scored more goals. Why? Because they got a couple more bounces apiece. Vrbata and Hornqvist each had career years. Hansen developed into a strong two-way threat. Even with Hendricks’ offensive meltdown, every other player increased their production.\\n\\nFor the record, Mason Raymond is not as bad as Matt Hendricks.',\n",
       " 'Purescript on AWS Lambda\\n\\nAWS Lambda is a service for provisioning code without the need to provision servers. It is a more constrained environment then EC2. JVM, Python, and Node.js are the only available runtimes (as of this writing). But you only pay for the compute cycles you use.\\n\\nPurescript is a typed, functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It resembles Haskell, though there are some semantic differences.\\n\\nThe code for this article is on Github. https://github.com/kofno/BasicLambda\\n\\nAWS Lambda Primer\\n\\nAWS Lamba allows you to provision your code as a Lambda Function. Each function is a small, constrained runtime environment. You can choose to execute your code on a JVM, Python, or Node.js runtime. Since Purescript targets JavaScript, we will focus on Node.js.\\n\\nYou may deploy your Lambda Function as a single file, or as a zip file containing a full Node.js module.\\n\\nLambda Functions support many triggering mechanisms. SNS topics, S3 events, calls through the API Gateway, cron style scheduling, etc. You can configure your function to execute in response to any of these.\\n\\nYour code will execute in response to a trigger. By default, AWS Lambda requires your index.js file and executes the exported handler function.\\n\\nA handler function is a javascript function that accepts two arguments.\\n\\nThe first argument is data. Data is just a JavaScript object. Its contents depends on how you are triggering the Lambda Function. We’ll come back to the data object.\\n\\nThe second argument is the context. The context object contains meta information about the lambda. It also contains succeed and fail callbacks for indicating when the function has completed.\\n\\nHere is an example of what a simple Lambda function handler might look like:\\n\\n\"use strict\"; exports.handler = function(data, context) { if (data.key1 && data.key2) { context.succeed(data); } else { context.fail(\"I have no idea what kind of object this is.\"); } };\\n\\nThis is a Lambda function written in Javascript. Let’s try writing one in Purescript.\\n\\nPurescript Example\\n\\nPurescript is a pure functional language with strong types. It shares a great deal in common with Haskell. We will be reviewing a couple features of the language that are pertinent to our work. You can read more about Purescript in the Purescript by Example book.\\n\\nEff - the Side Effect Type\\n\\nEvery program needs to perform native side effects to be useful. Native side effects includes writing to the screen or sending and receiving data.\\n\\nPurescript is a pure functional language. Because of this, it needs a special type to compose side effects. We call this type Eff.\\n\\nThe Eff type signature looks like this:\\n\\nforeign import Eff :: # ! -> * -> *\\n\\nLet’s unpack this signature.\\n\\nThe # kind is a rows constructor. Rows are like a records object. The ! kind is for side effects. The first part of signature describes rows of side effects.\\n\\nThe * kind describes a type. The * -> * defines a type constructor. The last part of the Eff signature specifies a type constructor.\\n\\nSo an Eff type is a row of side effects wrapped around another type. Here’s an Eff example from the Purescript book:\\n\\nmain :: Eff (console :: CONSOLE, random :: RANDOM) Unit main = do n <- random print n\\n\\nThe type of this function tells us a lot. We know there are side effects. We know that the side effects are writing to the console and generating a random number. We know that the function returns a Unit, which is a PureScript type for no meaningful return value.\\n\\nWe are going to be using native side effects in our Lambda function. Remember, I said that the context object has succeed and fail methods. These methods tell the Lambda function to end. This is a native side effect.\\n\\nLet’s create a simple context type for Purescript.\\n\\nforeign import data Context :: *\\n\\nHere we’ve described our Context as a type. We also will need to define an effect. We’ll call our effect LAMBDA.\\n\\nforeign import data LAMBDA :: !\\n\\nWe need to call succeed or fail on the context object so the Lambda shuts down. Purescript is a functional language. We can’t call methods on the Context type. Instead, we will call these methods from JavaScript, wrapping them in functions using FFI.\\n\\nBefore we write the functions, let’s write out the function signatures.\\n\\nforeign import succeed :: forall eff. Context -> String -> Eff (lambda :: LAMBDA | eff) Unit foreign import fail :: forall eff. Context -> String -> Eff (lambda :: LAMBDA | eff) Unit\\n\\nBoth these functions have the same type signature. They take a Context. Then they take a String, which Lambda logs when it ends the process. And they both have a LAMBDA side effect.\\n\\nNow we’ll look at the JavaScript implementation of these functions. Since both implementations look the same, we’ll only show succeed .\\n\\nexports.succeed = function(context) { return function(message) { return function() { context.succeed(message); }; }; };\\n\\nIt may surprise you that succeed is not a two argument function. Instead, each item in our type signature is a nested function. This is because PureScript, like Haskell, curries every function call.\\n\\nCalling succeed with a Context as an argument returns a function. Calling that function with a message argument returns a zero argument function. Calling the zero argument function executes our side effect action.\\n\\nProcessing Data with PureScript Foreign\\n\\nWe are not introspecting the Lambda context object. Because of that, we can get away with a simple representation; the Context type. The data object is a different story. We need to extract data from that object. For that, we will use the purescript-foreign library.\\n\\nJavascript allows us to poke around in any object using the dot notation. Purescript requires you to be a bit more upfront about the structure of the data you are expecting. For this example, we will assume a simple Javascript object:\\n\\n{ key1: \"key1\" , key2 : \"key2\" }\\n\\nYou might receive this object in a Lambda function through the API Gateway. Before we can use this in our Lambda function, need to convert it to a Purescript type. This type will work fine for us:\\n\\ndata LambdaData = LambdaData { key1 :: String , key2 :: String }\\n\\nThe purescript-foreign library will convert a foreign Javascript object into our new LambdaData type. To do this, we will use the Foreign type, the F type, and the IsForeign type class.\\n\\nThe Foreign type represents any data from an unreliable source. It is like our Context type from before.\\n\\nThe F is an error type that returns from our type class instance (more on that soon). F is actually an alias for an Either type. An Either type represents one of two possible outcomes; a Left and a Right . The Left value is usually reserved for reporting an error. The Right value holds the value if the computation was successful. This is the F definition:\\n\\ntype F = Either ForeignError\\n\\nThe IsForeign type class defines a read function. We will provide our own instance of read for the LambdaData type. This is where we provide the code for converting a foreign object to a Purescript type.\\n\\ninstance lambdaDataIsForeign :: IsForeign LambdaData where read value = do k1 <- readProp \"key1\" value k2 <- readProp \"key2\" value return $ LambdaData { key1: k1, key2: k2 }\\n\\nHere we are just reading ‘key1’ and ‘key2’ from the foreign value. If they are both there, then we construct a LambdaData type and return it wrapped in a Right . If they are not there, then our read function will return a Left along with the error message.\\n\\nWriting the Handler\\n\\nWe are now ready to write our Purescript handler. Here’s the type signature I came up with:\\n\\nhandler :: forall eff. Context -> Foreign -> Eff (lambda :: LAMBDA | eff) Unit\\n\\nThe handler function takes a Context. It then takes in the data, as a Foreign. It performs an action that has a side effect, but no meaningful value. The forall eff and | eff just mean “there may be other side effects, too”. We are explicit about listing LAMBDA as a side effect, because we know we are going to call success or fail .\\n\\nHere is one possible implementation of this function:\\n\\nhandler c d = do process $ readData d return unit where readData :: Foreign -> F LambdaData readData = read process :: F LambdaData -> Eff (lambda :: LAMBDA | eff) Unit process (Left err) = fail c $ show err process (Right d) = succeed c $ show d\\n\\nOne last thing; how can we get the Lambda function to call our handler? Purescript curries all function arguments; we can’t create a function that matches Lambda’s expectations.\\n\\nWe will need to keep our index.js file around to execute the Purescript code. The JavaScript file will now look like this:\\n\\n\"use strict\"; var lambda = require(\\'BasicLambda\\') exports.handler = function(data, context) { lambda.handler(context)(data)(); };\\n\\nHere we call the Purescript handler from within JavaScript. Remember that PureScript functions are always curried. We call the handler and hand it the context. It returns a function to us, which we call by passing in the data. We get a third function back. It is our side effect. This function takes no arguments when we call it.\\n\\nNotice that our Purescript module is compatible with node’s implementation of CommonJS. We can require the module, just like any other Javascript module.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nI tried to show how to write an AWS Lambda function in Purescript. I kept the functionality basic, so I could focus on compatibility. Future tutorials may show fetching S3 objects or manipulating images using ImageMagic.\\n\\nThe full code for this tutorial is available on Github. Clone the repo and you should be able to build and deploy the Lambda yourself. If you deploy the Lambda yourself, play with different test data. See how the Lambda reports errors or success.',\n",

It started when he and his family were forced off their Texas farm by union soldiers during reconstruction.

       " 'I woke covered in sweat and tears. Moonlight filtered in through my window bright enough for me to see. Another nightmare. One of flames and screams and fear. I shuddered and wiped my cheeks dry, getting out of the bed. I didn’t want to be alone tonight.\\n\\nToday had been my 18th birthday but I hadn’t told anyone. It was nothing to celebrate, the anniversary of my dad’s death. I walked quietly out of my room and down the hall towards Ezra’s. The house was silent; I could hear the creaks of the old wood. Outside a wolf howled and I shivered, thinking of the Weres. I opened the door and peered in through the darkness.\\n\\n“Ezra?” I called softly. I heard him mutter something and move. The fabric of the bed rustled.\\n\\n“Logan?” He asked with a voice heavy with sleep.\\n\\n“Can I…can I sleep with you tonight?” I asked, suddenly shy. Ezra pushed himself up in the bed and looked at me. I saw his mouth open for a moment but he quickly closed it.\\n\\n“Uhm,” He paused, staring at me, “Y-yea, that’s fine. Is everything okay?” He asked.\\n\\nI walked quietly towards him, the question catching me off guard. No one had asked me that before. Suddenly the tears welled to my eyes again. I opened my mouth to reply but nothing came out so I just shook my head. I don’t know why, but I wasn’t ashamed to cry in front of him. I think he heard my breath falter because he moved over, making room for me on the bed.\\n\\n“Come here.” He whispered, holding his arms out. I climbed on the bed and pressed myself into him. He smelled of cinnamon – brown and dry and sweet and warm. I wrapped his arms tight around me and leaned back, letting me rest on his chest. I closed my eyes and felt the rise and fall as he breathed. I could faintly hear his heartbeat, fast and strong. Why was his heart beating so fast?\\n\\n“Do you want to talk about it?” He asked quietly. I shook my head and shortly after I felt his head nod against mine. I closed my eyes as he began to run his fingers through my hair. “Go to sleep Logan, I won’t let you go.” He whispered against the top of my head and I did.\\n\\n*******\\n\\nI woke in the morning better rested than I had been in a long time. Ezra lay asleep beside me, his arms still wrapped around my body. I smiled softly and began to move carefully out of his grasp, not wanting to wake him. As soon as I thought I got out without him waking he opened his eyes and smiled at me.\\n\\n“Good morning Lo. I like your hair.” He yawned, stretching. I smiled, suddenly nervous. He had let me fall asleep last night, so would he ask for his repayment now? Would he get angry that I didn’t give him something last night?\\n\\n“Hey, what’s wrong?” He asked, sitting up and pulling me to him. I didn’t resist his touch and closed my eyes as his hand fell softly against my cheek.\\n\\n“Nothing.” I said, not meeting his eyes. “When uhm, when do you want me to repay you for last night?”\\n\\nWhen he didn’t reply after a moment I looked up to be met by eyes full of confusion. “Repay? What do you mea-“ He asked, then paused, understanding. Suddenly he let me go and sat back a bit. “Oh, no Logan. You don’t have to repay anything. Don’t ever think you need to do that. I’m not Alex or any of the other guys you’ve…been with.” He faltered for a moment, watching me.\\n\\n“Logan, I care about you. You can come to me anytime for any reason and I’ll be there for you, no matter what and with no repayment expected.” He stood up and cupped my hands in his hands. “I’m not some beast you have to please to get something. Not all men are animals Logan. Please, don’t think of me as such.” I nodded and looked away, wrapping my arms around myself, not sure of what to say. I had never been in a situation such as this.\\n\\n“Listen, let’s go out today okay? How about I take you out on the town and we explore a little? I’ll show you some of the best places in this village. We can eat something other than my horrible food. It’ll do you good to get out of this place, get your mind off the thoughts that consumed you last night.”\\n\\nI nodded and began to walk out. I opened the door and began to walk down the hall to my room when Rowan passed me. He said nothing, but his eyes bore into me. I looked away, too confused to deal with him now. I had never had a man be nice to me like this and not expect anything in return. Was there some ulterior motive? Was he really wanting something and just not telling me? I dropped my clothes and turned on the shower.\\n\\nMore confusing was this feeling in my chest. Never in my life had I felt this…this ache. It was warm, yet shocking like jumping into freezing water after sitting in the hot tub. It was terrifying yet safe as a mother’s arms. It scared me down to my core yet thrilled me beyond belief. I wanted to know this, to understand it and yet I wanted to throw up my walls and run from it without looking back. I shook my head and turned off the water. I would push it to the back of my mind for now and think of it later. For now, I had to get ready to see the town.\\n\\nAdvertisements',\n",
       " 'You thought Trump’s budget proposal was bad for OSHA? Well, our Republican friends in the House of Representatives have issued a bill that’s even worse, although we don’t have all of the details yet.\\n\\nThe subcommittee’s mark-up session doesn’t start until 4:30 this afternoon, and we still may not know the details until the full committee acts, possibly next week.\\n\\nThis is what we know (and read down for a rare bid of goodish news):\\n\\nOSHA: Trump proposed an OSHA budget of $543,257,000. The Republican bill provides OSHA with only $531,470,000 — almost $12 million less than Trump requested and $21 million, or 4% less than the current budget. We don’t have all of the details yet, but we do know that they are essentially flat funding the state plans, and we know that they are eliminating the Susan Harwood Worker Training Grants. (We know this because Harwood funding has previously been stipulated in the bill language. It’s not there any more.)\\n\\nMore significant cuts will mean even fewer OSHA inspectors — which mean fewer inspections and more workers who will get hurt, get sick and die in the workplace.\\n\\nSo by process of elimination, we know that if they’re putting the same $100,800,000 million into state plans, and they’re clearly going to increase compliance assistance, that leaves only enforcement and standards that they can plunder to make up the difference. OSHA was already looking at a 10% cut in enforcement staff from 2016 just based on a flat budget. Obviously, more significant cuts will mean even fewer OSHA inspectors — which mean fewer inspections and more workers who will get hurt, get sick and die in the workplace. (The AFL-CIO already estimates that it would take OSHA 159 years to inspect every workplace in the country and that promises to get much worse.)\\n\\nMSHA: MSHA is facing a $14 million cut ($15.2 million below Trump’s request) which, according the committee press release, “reflects the declining need for MSHA inspection activities due to the lower levels of mining across the country and especially in coal production.”\\n\\nNIOSH: There is some good(ish)news here. Trump had proposed a hefty $135 million (40%) cut in NIOSH’s budget. The committee bill restores most of that, only cutting $10 million (3%) from NIOSH’s budget. (It’s a sad day when a $10 million cut can be labeled “good news.”)\\n\\nDOL: In other Labor news, the bill also contains a rider prohibiting DOL from enforcing its Fiduciary Rule, requires financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients in retirement accounts. The rule had come partially into effect, although Acosta launched the regulatory process to weaken the rule, while promising to enforce the parts in effect. Passage of this rider would mean that the Department would not be able to even enforce the part of the rule that is in effect.\\n\\nJob Corps is also being cut $16 million over the 2017 enacted level, but $239.7 million above Trump’s budget request.\\n\\nThe full committee is expected to meet soon, and it’s possible there will be more poison-pill riders there. Stay tuned, and keep calling.',\n",

       " 'Anticipating up to a million eclipse visitors, public land managers in Oregon prepared for the worst. But their fears of human-caused wildfires and environmental destruction never came to pass.\\n\\nPatrick Lair with the U.S. Forest Service drove into the Ochoco National Forest to see how things looked after hosting thousands of eclipse visitors.\\n\\nHe drove the same road on Wednesday that more than 30,000 people took to get into the massive Symbiosis Festival on Big Summit Prairie – a patch of private land in the middle of the national forest.\\n\\n“At one point, we had bumper-to-bumper traffic from the prairie out past Prineville,” he said. “I’m kind of amazed not to see more trash on the sides of the road.”\\n\\nWith all the festival-goers — plus additional eclipse visitors looking to camp in the path of totality – officials worried about people trampling vegetation and driving off-road through the forest. With dry conditions and late-summer heat, they were especially worried about people accidentally starting wildfires.\\n\\nAnticipating up to a million eclipse visitors statewide, public land managers prepared for the worst. Now, as they survey the damage, they’re finding many of their fears of environmental destruction never came to pass.\\n\\nThe road into the Ochocos is littered with some discarded bottles, the occasional strand of toilet paper and several abandoned vehicles. But considering how many people traveled through here, Lair said, it’s looking really good.\\n\\n“I think we all were expecting the worst, and when it didn’t happen we all were pleasantly surprised,” Lair said. “Not that there aren’t impacts – there will certainly be trash to pick up.”\\n\\nPrineville Police Department\\n\\nCassandra Profita/OPB/EarthFix\\n\\nClean campgrounds, few fires\\n\\nLisa Clark with the Prineville District of the Bureau of Land Management is also along for the drive. She said her agency oversees more than a million acres of public land in Central Oregon and was prepared to see up to 500,000 visitors for the eclipse.\\n\\nWe stop at a large campsite in a wide-open clearing that was full during the eclipse on Monday. But there’s no evidence of all the people who were here just a couple days ago.\\n\\n“It looks like someone came through and did a really nice cleanup job,” Clark said.\\n\\nFederal agencies had encouraged to see visitors stopping in at their information booth in Prineville to unload extra trash they cleaned up from neighboring campsites, Clark said. She also suspects they saw less than half the number of visitors they prepared for.\\n\\nShe checks inside the bathroom for any hidden trash.\\n\\n“It’s always good to check inside outhouses and port-a-potties,” she said, pulling open the metal door. “I am absolutely amazed. There’s a little bit of toilet paper left and no trash. It looks clean.”\\n\\nEven more amazing? Over the past week, her agency has only gotten one report of a fire that hadn’t been fully extinguished. That’s less than she’d expect to see on a normal summer weekend.\\n\\n“In general, abandoned campfires and escaped campfires are our number one cause of human caused wildfires on Forest Service and BLM land,” she said. “So our expectation would have been – with just the sheer number of people we had – somebody would have made that mistake.”\\n\\nCassandra Profita/OPB/EarthFix\\n\\nEnvironmental impacts?\\n\\nWith campgrounds filled up, another concern was the environmental impacts of dispersed camping in the forest. Finding those impacts falls to Forest Service hydrologist Rob Tanner, who leads a team of experts called a Resource Assessment and Mitigation Team.\\n\\n“So this is kind the next stage — post-eclipse,” he said. “We’re calling it the RAM team.”\\n\\nOn Wednesday, after giving visitors time to clear out of the woods, Tanner gathered up his team begin to assess environmental impacts in the Ochocos. The team will go to the places where they know people went off-road to camp and see if the soil, plants, waterways and wildlife were negatively impacted.\\n\\n“Initially, before the eclipse, we put together a fairly large team because we just didn’t know what to expect,” he said. “We have soil scientists, archaeologists, aquatics folks — which are hydrologists and fisheries biologists – wildlife biologists, engineers looking at the roads and a few other folks as well.”\\n\\nThey’ll decide where they’re most needed after reviewing aerial videos collected during the eclipse. But Tanner said they might not have a whole lot of work to do.\\n\\n“We know we had less visitors than anticipated, so, we’ve kind of ratcheted back,” he said. “We don’t know exactly what’s out there, but we’re hoping less visitors equals less potential resource issues.”\\n\\nOn Thursday, the team found trash, abandoned vehicles, messy campsites and human waste dumped from an RV. Unpleasant? Most definitely. But overall, from the Painted Hills in Eastern Oregon to Mary’s Peak in the Coast Range, officials seemed to agree that public information campaigns paid off with hundreds of thousands of visitors doing very little damage to public lands.\\n\\nCourtesy of the National Park Service\\n\\nWidespread relief\\n\\nShelly Hall, superintendent of the Painted Hills-John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, knew she had some pretty fragile ground to protect as her office fielded non-stop phone calls from people planning to visit in the weeks leading up to the eclipse.\\n\\nThe National Park Service brought in incident management teams from parks around the country to help control the crowds and keep them away from sensitive areas.\\n\\nWhile the park did get quite crowded with eclipse visitors, Hall said, there were very few problems. She credits all the extra planning and support staff.\\n\\nCassandra Profita/OPB/EarthFix\\n\\n“Everything went very very smoothly,” she said. “I’m really relieved because I was afraid I’d be sitting at this point thinking of all these horrible things that happened and none of it happened.”\\n\\nThere were no fires, no medical emergencies or car accidents.\\n\\n“All those things we were going through – all the what-ifs during the planning,” she said. “None of those things happened.”\\n\\nJude McHugh, spokeswoman for the Willamette National Forest, said despite smoky skies and some closed areas including the Mount Jefferson Wilderness, many visitors still came to the forest to watch the eclipse from high peaks and open prairies. But they didn’t leave much behind, she said.\\n\\n“There was only one escaped campfire,” she said, “indicating most visitors respected the campfire ban.”\\n\\nChris Havel with Oregon State Parks said he saw a similarly rosy picture on state land across the path of totality.\\n\\n“We had good crowds,” he said. “People got in and got out without any problems. Of course, there was some traffic on the way out, but overall things went surprisingly well. I was expecting a big long list of issues, but no. We’re all sort of scratching our heads, like, ‘What did we miss?’”\\n\\nHall said she doesn’t agree with people who argue that the whole event was over-hyped and that there was actually nothing to worry about.\\n\\n“People say, ‘Oh, it’s like Y2K,’ and I don’t think that’s the case,” she said. “I think lots and lots of people did come, but we planned well and people behaved well. People just wanted to come and experience the eclipse, and it was a very cool experience.”',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\\n\\nTampa, (Fl) --- There are several analysis that can be made to Calvin & Hobbes, from the philosophical traces of Bill Watterson to the use of science as a component of the satire. There is not going to be another Calvin and Hobbes and there is not going to be any spiritual successor of this comic, that has been concluded since 1995.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s amazing that\\'s been almost 20 years since Calvin and Hobbes ended, and the comics strip it is still as fresh as it was on November 18th of 1985. It\\'s quite amazing to think how much the world has changed in the last 29 years. Paris is Still Burning and Jenny Livingston went to make television, AIDS is still a menace, the newer generations are focused on more of the sensual pleasures (not to mention, clicktivism) where they ask for anything without even working; school system keeps failing and becoming more intolerant with everyone... The list can keep going on because the topics that the cartoon dealt are still valid, because even with the time people can always find a point to argue using critical analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe juxtaposition of Calvin and Hobbes personality goes on practicality vs. impulsive actions; not necessarily old vs. young; as Hobbes if we go on the idea of imaginary friend is just a mere reflect on Calvin\\'s more mature persona but yet with the ambiguity and analysis of relation toward reality. We can think, that Hobbes is just a mere reflection on what Calvin will become, maybe it could be applied towards the Millennials if they learn to look beyond the sensuous pleasures in life and learn how to work their lives out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn one of the story arcs, where the family goes on a camping trip Calvin shows a total annoyance to be in contact with the nature as there were no amenities or technology that he could use; to think the strip had the beginning on the late 1980\\'s and see how a child can\\'t focus his attention because there are no technologies is some of a \"problem\" that is still seen today, where kids can\\'t see themselves without a functioning tablet, computer or handheld video games.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalvin, is on the point of finding his own cultural identity, there are no points that can relate them to the counter culture movements of the previous ones, there is not a solid ideology and some of the political ideas are related to grassroots waves that create influences because of the Internet weight. Probably Calvin is more keen to Generation X, both generations tend to be interrelated on the use of technology and also to be more liberal on certain ideas opposite to the Baby Boomers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalvin and his parents could be seen as both generations living under one roof, but yet the depth of his parents was never explored to know if they were more progressive than they looked on-panel; maybe, Calvin himself could be a reflection of his parents ideals on how to deal with reality and with people, even on an intellectual level.',\n",

       " \"says himself, there are two jobs in the world where you cannot lie to your customer. One is a doctor. The other is a bartender. A doctor will do his best to heal his customer's body, and a bartender will do his best to heal his customer's soul. Ryuu Sasakura shows incredible skills at figuring people out and what is going in their head, as he then manage to heal their worries or troubles with a drink and a lesson hidden within his very cocktails. Not only that but I also guarantee you that you'll learn a lot about alcohols too.Art :The art is just incredible. Not only is it well drawn, but it is drawn in a way that puts the right ambiance at the right moment increasing the strength of the emotions the characters are trying to make us, reader, feel about their situation. It is rather soothing and refreshing with a great attention to details too.Character :Probably, no, most likely Bartender's strongest point. The main characters are very well written and easy to like. But it also has a strong cast of other characters in each chapter, some of them who return later and some of them who we will see only once. But it doesn't stop them from being just as well made as the main characters. Each of them has a past, a personality that was worked on. They just don't get more character development but at the very least you'll remember them for who they were and they leave an impression. And it doesn't stop there. The way they interact with each other, especially with Ryuu Sasakura, the main character, leads to multiple interesting situations. It is a shame, truly, that it is hard for me to make justice to the way characters interact with each other, I just hope I could explain it better but it has to be read.Enjoyment :I knew a little bit about alcohols, just a bit and I wasn't particularly interested in that but I liked the things I learned, it was rather entertaining on its own, but the manga as a whole with the characters, the story and all, truly a masterpiece. Those who only like action based manga will probably fall asleep on it, but for those who prefer a more soothing and calm manga where words count more than how many sword hits one can do in a second, I highly suggest this manga. It has its share of funny moments too, don't forget about it, but really, the thing that I liked the more about it is just how easy I could go and read it without stopping or being able to notice the time pass.Final words :Give it a try, trust me, you will not regret it.\",\n",
       " \"It appears the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are kind of done with Doug Martin. That's according to Pewter Report, who published a column filled with notes on the Bucs' efforts in free agency yesterday. What's more, they noted that the Bucs would be interested in moving Martin in a straight swap for Adrian Peterson, provided the latter would be willing to take a pay cut.\\n\\nMartin looked like a true feature back way back in 2012, when he racked up nearly 2,000 yards from scrimmage, but fell off the map since then. Averaging just 3.7 yards per carry since then, the Muscle Hamster has looked more like an eminently replaceable backup than a capable starter over the past two years. Martin's issues had a variety of causes, but one of those causes was his own play.\\n\\nThat wasn't lost on the Bucs, who re-signed Bobby Rainey this offseason and drafted Charles Sims last year. With Mike James in the building too, they have the talent in place to replace Martin by a committee.\\n\\nBut that doesn't appear to be the team's preference. Pewter Report notes that not only would the Bucs be interested in trading for Adrian Peterson at a cheap price, they also pursued DeMarco Murray, who turned out to be too expensive for their liking.\\n\\nIt seems pretty clear that the Bucs are willing to move on from Martin, and want to find a real back they can count on. Doing the former is easy, but the latter will be a real problem. It's not like the Bucs don't have a slew of other needs to fill, too.\",\n",
       " 'Visiting Walt Disney World is a magical experience for a family. Often overlooked are the cast members who make those magical moments a reality. Sadly many guests don’t appreciate the work the cast members do, and sometimes are even disrespectful to the cast members. Cast members have to take on this rudeness and turn it into magical moments. It is not as easy of a job as most guests assume.\\n\\n1) Why yelling at the cast members won’t help\\n\\nYelling at a cast member when you are upset is the last thing you should do. Even if they have done something wrong, yelling at them won’t fix the problem. You are not going to get what you want out of yelling at the cast member. Asking your questions in a calm and collected manner to the cast member instead of yelling will allow the cast member to have an adult conversation that will most likely solve your problem.\\n\\nIf a certain cast member won’t listen to your recommendations, or is simply being inappropriate, then the best way to solve the problem is to go to guest services and report the incident. Simply asking to see the cast member’s name tag and then telling guest services at the front of the park is the best way to get the results you want.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2) Realizing it is probably not the cast member’s fault\\n\\nWhen an attraction is having technical issues, it is not the cast members fault. While working at the Magic Kingdom in 2013, I was told, “You’ve ruined my son’s vacation because ‘you’ broke this ride.” In reality my shift had just started, and I had no idea why the attraction wasn’t working. Before I could explain that I had just started my shift the women stormed away.\\n\\nA lot of times cast members are just relaying the message from someone else. When they tell you, “Sorry, you can’t bring your drink on this attraction” the cast members are not the ones who made up that rule. So don’t get mad at them, if you are truly upset with the rules then ask guest services about it.\\n\\n3) Following the cast member’s instructions\\n\\nWhen a cast member asks you to do something it most likely is for your own safety. They aren’t telling you what to do to be the fun police; they are telling you not to do something because they’ve already seen people get severely hurt doing it before. While Walt Disney World is meant to be a place where you can leave your responsibilities behind, it doesn’t mean you can leave your manners behind, and so by ignoring what the cast member is telling you it’s not only dangerous but also very rude.',\n",

       " 'Not Sparkles The Clown AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd There are some disturbing aspects to a police tactic known as civil forfeiture, which lets cops make money from seizing cash and property from alleged criminals, as detailed in story by Robert O\\'Harrow Jr. and Steven Rich at the Washington Post.\\n\\nThe Justice Department\\'s Equitable Sharing Program allows local police departments to keep 80% of the stuff seized during drug raids and other investigations. While it sounds unbelievable, police can seize your assets even if you\\'re never convicted of a crime as long as cops believe you obtained the property illegally.\\n\\nYou can go to court to get it back, but that\\'s a long and expensive process that\\'s just not realistic for a lot of people.\\n\\nMeanwhile, police departments can use the money to boost their budgets. The article in the Post suggests that much of this money doesn\\'t go to practical crime-fighting gear. In some departments civil forfeiture cash has paid for military-grade equipment that might be more suitable for a war zone than a US city or town.\\n\\nThe military gear includes an armored personnel carrier costing $227,000 in Douglasville, Ga. as well as a $1 million mobile command bus in Prince George\\'s County, Maryland and a $5 million helicopter for Los Angeles cops.\\n\\nThen there the more frivolous things civil forfeiture cash buys, like a $637 coffee maker for cops in Amarillo, Texas and $5,300 worth of \"challenge coin\" medallions in Brunswick County, North Carolina.\\n\\nPerhaps the oddest purchase was $225 spent on a clown in Reminderville, Ohio meant to improve relations between the community and police. Here\\'s how Chief Jeff Buck defended that purchase to the Post: \"The money I spent on Sparkles the Clown is a very, very minute portion of the forfeited money that I spend in fighting the war on drugs.\"\\n\\nThis isn\\'t just a matter of police being fiscally irresponsible. They\\'re being irresponsible with cash that may very well have been seized from innocent people.\\n\\nThe Washington Post examined 43,000 reports on asset seizures dating back to 2008, which reported $2.5 billion in spending from these seizures. According to the Post\\'s analysis, 81% of that spending came from seizures in which the property or cash owners were never indicted.',\n",

       " 'We’re on the road to WrestleMania once again, and to paraphrase incomparable Good Ole’ JR, in my 15 years as a fan in the business I have never seen anything quite like this—only that’s not the astonished high praise that phrase is usually reserved for. Within the WWE Universe, up is down. Black is white. The Voice of the Voiceless has gone silent. Fans have never felt more powerless and…well, like they’re being deliberately f----d with. But is that the point?\\n\\nTo call WWE’s programming over the past seven or eight months an emotional roller coaster would be a severe understatement. WWE seems to be on the cusp of an explosive new era, lead by world-class talents such as Daniel Bryan, Cesaro, Bray Wyatt, The Shield, and more. Triple H has famously said WWE has the greatest focus group in the world, and that they cater to the desires of the people. It’s a nice thought, but how does that explain screwing Bryan out of the championship for seven months? How does that explain Bryan not winning the Rumble? How does that explain Batista?\\n\\n\\n\\nAhem. Sorry. BOO-Tista.\\n\\nThe rise of Daniel Bryan is unquestionably the biggest story to come out of professional wrestling since 2011’s “Summer of Punk,” and might be the most meteoric rise to popularity since Stone Cold. Fans are lining up in some random hotel for autographs and pictures with Daniel Bryan, entire basketball arenas are “YES!”ing, USA Today is giving Bryan the oft-coveted mainstream coverage and the Super Bowl champs have adopted his battle cry. Daniel Bryan has done what we all thought was unthinkable in today’s world: he’s a wrestler who has broken through to the mainstream.\\n\\nInstead of rewarding this obscene amount of self-generated momentum, however, WWE provides mind-blowing insanity such as Big Show hijacking the “YES!” chants and main eventing Survivor Series, Bryan inexplicably turning heel for three weeks, and a 45-year-old grandfather of two winning the Royal Rumble after a four year vacation in the greatest mismanagement of a story that writes itself this side of Nash texting himself. To further compare the situation to Austin, this would be like if in January 1998, instead of Austin finally getting a shot at the title via a Rumble win, Lex Luger came back and won it for some reason. A recognizable, but not necessarily exciting relic of the past usurping the role the people’s chosen champion is supposed to play.\\n\\nWrestling fans are no strangers to baffling booking decisions by the WWE, but this sort of writing just subverts all logic to the point where there has to be another explanation outside of the usual “ineptitude.” The truth is anyone’s guess, but a growing idea amongst diehards is that we’re seeing the dawning of something being referred to as “Kayfabe 2.0.”\\n\\nKayfabe (Kayfabe 1.0 that is; Kayfabe vanilla)—the idea of taking everything seen on TV as the gospel truth—is a concept that has existed only in principle for some time now. WWE openly admits their products are entertainment, not sport—hell, WWE produces a show that delves into the real lives of stars such as Bryan Danielson, the man behind the “Daniel Bryan” character. This bleeds into the flagship shows’ storylines; moments of extreme concern cause Stephanie McMahon to ‘drop the act’ and address her husband as “Paul” rather than “Triple H.” The nascent days of the Attitude Era saw Shawn Michaels making thinly veiled references to Vince McMahon being the man in charge rather than just a loyal play-by-play commentator. CM Punk’s infamous pipebomb made references to other wrestling companies—heresy in the McMahon kingdom.\\n\\nBut these sorts of things always felt more like neat little easter eggs rather than the focal point; nods to the fans who take the time to dive deeper into the inner workings of professional wrestling—the “Internet fans” or “smart marks” if you will. The problem is that this isn’t 1997 anymore, and inside info isn’t only found in the deep recesses of Internet usenets and message board. In 2014, nearly everybody is an “Internet fan,” because nearly every fan uses the Internet on a daily basis. You don’t even have to seek out the ‘dirt sheets’ anymore; look at any comment thread on anything posted by WWE’s official Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts. Everyone knows CM Punk is gone, and acting like he never existed isn’t sweeping the problem under the rug, it’s exacerbating it tenfold as the news spreads like wildfire.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Am I f-----g going over?”\\n\\nBut back to the first question posed in the article: what if that’s the point? Triple H and The Authority are ostensibly heels (although sometimes it’s hard to keep track with their schizophrenic booking), which means we are supposed to hate them. In an era where fan support is given to performers with strong in-ring and mic skills and not just to the ones who speak highly of their hometown, it becomes increasingly harder to get the crowd to play nice and boo the heels. So how do you get the crowd to hate you? Simple: Book a s----y show! Push wrestlers no one wants to see!\\n\\nWWE has seems to have taken the philosophy “If you can’t fool ’em, troll ’em.” Kayfabe 2.0, rather than working the casual fan who might not even be sure if it’s totally real or staged, works the informed fan. The people like you or me who obsess over every nugget of wrestling-related minutiae we can get our hands on. CM Punk walking out on the company? Work. Vince McMahon explaining to his shareholders that Punk is “taking a sabbatical?” Man, Vin-man is really selling that walkout angle! The payoff at ‘Mania will be huge! Daniel Bryan being held back and beat down on nearly every episode of Raw since SummerSlam? SLOW BURN GUYS. They’re just trolling us, Bryan will get his comeuppance at ‘Mania. It just makes too much sense. It writes itself; they just can’t do anything else. Right?\\n\\nIt’s a crazy idea and on the surface seems like self-inflicted sabotage, but we have to remember that Vince McMahon didn’t become a billionaire by accident. He must have some modicum of competency at his job. He must be able to see the writing on the wall and know that Daniel Bryan is a license to print money. This could actually be the “slow burn” that has been heralded for so long it’s to the point of parody. There’s just no logical reason to go forward with a Randy Orton vs. Batista main event, when the fans have made it abundantly clear it’s about the last thing they want to see and fully intend on booing the capstone of the 30th anniversary of WrestleMania out of the building.\\n\\nSo maybe this is suspension of disbelief in the 21st century. Suspending our disbelief at shockingly poor decisions in hopes that good (writing) overcomes evil (contractual obligations). Despite conceptions of Vince McMahon as a curmudgeonly luddite who refuses to get with the times, WWE has in reality always been ahead of the curve; the WWE Network is evidence of that. And in a world where every form of entertainment becomes increasingly meta, maybe this is WWE’s way of getting with the times and working the fans in an entirely new way. After all, I’ve never harbored a more genuine hatred for a professional wrestling heel than I do currently for The Authority, so if that’s their plan, bra-f-----g-vo.\\n\\nOr, ya know, Kayfabe 2.0 could be a figment of our imaginations and WWE could really have lost their collective minds. Either way, Batista’s got three words for ya: “Deal with it!”',\n",
       " \"Wake Up America - Share Pat's Columns!\\n\\nby Patrick j. Buchanan\\n\\nBy 1988, Ronald Reagan, who had famously branded the Soviet Union “an evil empire,” was striding through Red Square arm-in-arm with Mikhail Gorbachev. Russians were pounding both men on the back.\\n\\nThey had just signed the greatest arms reduction agreement in history â€“ eliminating all Soviet SS-20s targeted on Europe, in return for removal of the Pershing and cruise missiles Reagan had deployed in Europe.\\n\\n“Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, But to be young was very heaven!” wrote Wordsworth about his first hearing the news of the fall of the Bastille.\\n\\nMany of us felt that way then.\\n\\nWithin three years, the Berlin Wall had come down, the puppet regimes of Eastern Europe had been swept away, Germany was reunited, the Red Army had gone home, the Soviet Empire had vanished and the Soviet Union had broken up into 15 nations. The Baltic republics were free. Ukraine was free.\\n\\nYet, on the eve of the G-8 summit, Vladimir Putin has announced that Russia would re-target missiles on NATO. We must, he said, counter Bush’s decision to put anti-missile missiles in Poland and radars in the Czech Republic. Why are we doing this?\\n\\nThe United States says the ABM system in Europe is to defend against an Iranian attack. But Tehran has no atom bomb and no ICBM.\\n\\nWe appear to be headed for a second Cold War â€“ and, if we are, responsibility will not fully rest with the Kremlin. For among those who have mismanaged the relationship are presidents Clinton and Bush II, the baby boomers who appear to have kicked away the fruits of a Cold War victory won by their Greatest Generation predecessors.\\n\\nHow did they do it?\\n\\n* When the Red Army went home from Eastern Europe, the United States, in violation of an understanding with Moscow, began to move NATO east. We have since brought into our military alliance six former members of the Warsaw Pact and three former provinces of the Soviet Union: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.\\n\\n* Anti-Russia hawks are now pushing to bring Ukraine and Georgia into NATO. If they succeed, we could be dragged into future confrontations with a nuclear-armed Russia about who has sovereignty over the Crimea and whether South Ossetia should be part of Georgia.\\n\\nAre these vital U.S. interests worth risking a war? Why are we moving a U.S.-led military alliance into the front yard and onto the side porch of a country with thousands of nuclear weapons? Would we accept any commensurate Chinese or Russian move in the Caribbean?\\n\\n* After Moscow gave us a green light to use the former Soviet republics of Central Asia to base U.S. forces for the Afghan war, the United States has sought permanent bases there. Russia and China have now united to throw us out of their back yard.\\n\\n* America colluded with Azerbaijan and Georgia to build a Baku-Tiblisi-Ceyhan pipeline to transmit Caspian Sea oil across the Caucasus to the Black Sea and Turkey, cutting Russia out of the action.\\n\\n* In 1999, the United States bombed Serbia 78 days to punish her for fighting to hold her cradle province of Kosovo, which Muslim Albanians were tearing away. Orthodox Russia had long seen herself as protectress of the Balkan Slavs. That Clinton ignored Russia in launching this unprovoked war on Serbia was seen in Moscow as proof that Russian concerns had become irrelevant in Washington.\\n\\n* After helping dump over the government in Belgrade, our Neocomintern â€“ the National Endowment for Democracy, Freedom House and other fronts â€“ interfered in Ukraine and Georgia, helping oust pro-Moscow regimes and install pro-American ones. Since then, NED has been run out of Belarus and its subsidiaries are about to get the boot from Moscow.\\n\\nCan we blame the Russians for being angry? How would we react to left-wing NGOs in Washington, flush with Moscow oil money, aiding elements hostile to the Bush administration?\\n\\n* The United States has been constantly hectoring Russia on backsliding from democracy. But compared to Beijing, Moscow is Montpelier, Vt. And why, if the Cold War is over, are Russia’s political arrangements any of our business?\\n\\nIf we don’t like the way Putin treats Mikhail Khorokovsky, Boris Berezovksy and the other “oligarchs” who robbed Russia blind in the 1990s, maybe Putin doesn’t like how we treated Martha Stewart.\\n\\nHarry Truman is often blamed for having started the Cold War. He didn’t. Stalin did. But Clinton, George W. and the neocons have a strong claim to having started the second. A first order of business of the next president should be to repair the damage this crowd has done â€“ and to get out of Russia’s face.\",\n",

       " 'Nasty rumors regarding Ben Affleck’s solo Batman film have been making the rounds for a while now, but the project may have reached a new Bat-low. According to FSW sources, Affleck wants out of the film altogether. Which means he would no longer portray the Dark Knight in subsequent films set in the DC Extended Universe. In addition to Affleck ditching the project, recent hire Matt Reeves, director of Cloverfield and War for the Planet of the Apes, has already backed out as well.\\n\\nThis doesn’t bode well for fans of the series as similar situations have hit the production of The Flash film as well. But fear not faithful nerds, there is a new glimmer of hope for Batman!\\n\\nA trusted FSW source has reported that the genius filmmaker behind hits such as Chronicle and Fantastic Four has been tapped to direct, produce, write, and star in The Batman.\\n\\nThat’s right, Joshua Trank, the guy fired from the Boba Fett solo Star Wars anthology film, is taking over the next Batman film. But don’t worry folks, Trankman’s trusty sidekick, the screenwriter boy wonder, Max Landis will be assisting with writing duties. Landis is no stranger to the DC universe, as he has written a well-praised Superman comic and has a sequel story releasing sometime this year. The duo are a solid choice but what about Trank’s acting chops? Could he really replace Affleck as the Caped Crusader. Well, no. He doesn’t plan on portraying Batman, but rather he would be the main villain of the film: the Riddler, alongside Joe Manganiello’s Deathstroke.\\n\\nTrank as the Riddler? Sounds odd but okay, we’ll take it. Then what about the World’s Greatest Detective? Who will portray him since Affleck has departed? Christian Bale?\\n\\nAs it turns out The Force Awakens star, Oscar Isaac, is being eyed by Trank to be his Batman. Isaac would be the same Batman as Affleck’s similar to Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney all being the same Batman in the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher series of the late 80’s/early 90’s.\\n\\nAccording to a source close to Isaac, his Batman will be more of a detective than any previous film adaptation of the character, and the Riddler is a great psychological villain who could rival Heath Ledger’s Joker in The Dark Knight if portrayed correctly. Isaac is said to be close to sealing the deal with Trank and Landis for the project.\\n\\nStar Wars fans should be excited to see Oscar taking on a great lead role like this, but we at FSW are worried that another lackluster superhero film could tarnish his acting resume.

       " 'Between now and Opening Day, HardballTalk will take a look at each of baseball’s 30 teams, asking the key questions, the not-so-key questions, and generally breaking down their chances for the 2014 season. First up: The Texas Rangers.\\n\\nThe Big Question: Were the bold moves bold enough?\\n\\nThe past two offseasons seasons saw the division rival Angels make huge additions in Josh Hamilton and Albert Pujols. Those moves didn’t work and, indeed, those moves are cited as part of the reason the Angels have fizzled. Too much star power, not enough depth, they’ve said. It takes more than the big moves to make a contender. So why should the Rangers’ big offseason moves — trading for Prince Fielder and Shin-Soo Choo be any different?\\n\\nBecause they fit a heck of a lot better with the Rangers than those other guys fit with the Angels, that’s why. The Rangers needed on-base ability at the top of the lineup. They needed someone with pop from the left side who can take advantage of the short porch in right down in Arlington. Choo and Fielder supply that in spades. Indeed, Choo is one of baseball’s true on-base machines, and the fact that Jon Daniels and Ron Washington have committed to batting him leadoff is going to mean good things for the lineup. Getting Prince Fielder out of Detroit — and getting him in shape — will do wonders as well. It’ll be hard to find anyone the baseball punditry says will have a better bounceback year than Fielder.\\n\\nYes, the Rangers had to give up Ian Kinsler to snag Fielder, but havung Jurickson Profar move into a regular, everyday role at second base is a nice fallback option. If he plays to his potential, the Rangers could have another star on their hands. If he falters, at least his glove should be solid.\\n\\nUnlike the Angels, the Rangers were not a team trying to patch over several holes with a couple of high-profile signings. They were a strong team who needed a push over the top after falling a couple games short for the AL West title the past two seasons. With Choo and Fielder they should get it.\\n\\nWhat else is going on?\\n\\nInjuries to the rotation are going to go a long way towards determining the Rangers’ fate. Yu Darvish, Matt Harrison and Martin Perez make a nice 1-2-3, but Harrison’s early-spring back issues are worth watching and not having Derek Holland around for the first half of the season due to knee surgery is a big problem. If Harrison is OK and Holland can step in when he’s healthy, the rotation should be OK. If both of those guys are gimpy much of the year Ron Washington is going to lean heavily on Alexi Ogando, Nick Tepesch and Tommy Hanson, and all of those guys are question marks. There’s a lot of depth here, but there’s also a chance that Texas is sporting a rotation with way too many 4-5 guys as the season wears on.\\n\\nThe closer spot could be an all-or-nothing proposition. With Joe Nathan gone we have Neftali Feliz and Joakim Soria vying for ninth inning duties. Both are not too far-removed from dominant pitching and even less far-removed from Tommy John surgery. If one bounces back to his old form, the Rangers have a closer. If both do, they have a two-headed monster in the late innings which could shorten games.\\n\\nA.J. Pierzynski is in Boston, leaving catching duties to Geovany Soto, who has been a backup the past couple of seasons, and J.P. Arencibia, who was one of the worst offensive players in all of baseball last year. Each is capable of so much more than they’ve done recently. It’ll be interesting to see if either of them can regain lost form.\\n\\nRon Washington’s contract was just extended through 2015. Seems like a late and somewhat short vote of confidence compared to how these things usually go for guys with a couple of pennants under their belt. If the Rangers, after taking on Fielder and signing Choo, underachieve this season, it wouldn’t be at all shocking to see Wash on the hot seat.\\n\\nPrediction: That seat shouldn’t be too hot, though. The lineup is stacked. If the rotation doesn’t implode, this is one of the best teams in the AL. First place, AL West.',\n",
       " 'Just 12 days after being released from Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Rousimar Palhares is still coming to grips with the fact that, despite being one of the best mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters and submission wizards on the planet, he will no longer be able to show off his skills inside the Octagon.\\n\\n\"Toquinho\" was let go by the ZUFFA-owned promotion after he failed to release a ligament-tearing heel hook he had on Mike Pierce during their welterweight showdown (video here) at UFC Fight Night 29 back on Oct 9, 2013 in Barueri, Sao Paulo, Brazil.\\n\\nWhile Rousimar is adamant he never intended to hurt Pierce, the apology has fallen on deaf ears as he\\'ll now be forced to look for another promotion (not Bellator) to pick a fight.\\n\\nAnd now that he\\'s had a few days to digest everything, a \"very sad\" Palhares admits that he may have held on to the submission a bit longer than he should have, but did not realize it during the fight, as it was only after he watched the tape that he came to the conclusion.\\n\\nNevertheless, Palhares offered up his apologies and reiterated that he never meant to hurt Pierce during his recent appearance on \"The MMA Hour:\"\\n\\n\"No, I did not want to hurt him. In the heat of the fight I did not feel him tap. Afterwards, when I watched the fight I realized that I held on too long, but I really did not mean to hurt him. He is a fighter like I am and I know he does this for a living and I would never want to hurt him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen asked about his past track record of holding submission too long, \"Toquinho\" says it\\'s his aggressive style that\\'s to blame but that he never has ill will in his heart, he just wants to make sure he gets the win.\\n\\nHe explains:\\n\\n\"I think it has a lot to do with my style, I am really aggressive when I go after submissions. There has been times where I do not hold on and people get out and then I lose the fight, I am the way I fight. I\\'m getting better and been working a lot on this, but, this is my style.\"\\n\\nRousimar went on to dispel any rumors that has hurt his training partner in practice, despite populate belief.\\n\\nFurthermore, Palhares says that he respects UFC President Dana White\\'s decision to cut him from the promotion and say despite having the door shut on him for now, he will try his hardest to make it back to the Octagon.\\n\\nBut after getting suspended by the Brazilian athletic commission for 120 days, it will be a while before he gets to fight again.

       " 'Historical Motorsports Stories writes:\\n\\n\"The Stange Story of the Humpy Bumper\"\\n\\nPosted by nascarman on September 28, 2017\\n\\nViewed 1578 times Tweet In early 2001, NASCAR was in big trouble. Over a period of eight months, four drivers had died in similar, head-on crashes. The series was thrown into a period of rapid research and development to protect the lives of those who raced. Over the course of 2001, head and neck restraint devices were mandated, kill switches were required, and alternatives to concrete walls were further researched. Soft walls were sure to absorb a lot of an accident\\'s force, but why make soft walls when you could have a soft car?\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah, why not make the front of the car absorb an impact? While HANS devices and SAFER barriers became common, a planned soft bumper was an aspect that never came to be. This is the odd story of the \"Humpy Bumper.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Humpy Bumper (Pete McCole / autoracing1.com)\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter Adam Petty, Kenny Irwin, and Tony Roper lost their lives in 2000, safety improvements became a hot topic. The 2001 season started with a debate over the effectiveness of the HANS device and how this restraint may help save lives. After Dale Earnhardt died, further pressure was placed on all drivers to wear one.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut maybe something could be done outside of the driver\\'s cockpit.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe the cars weren\\'t absorbing enough of the impact. They\\'re built of steel tubes welded into a roll cage, maybe that\\'s too strong. Then-President of Charlotte Motor Speedway, Humpy Wheeler had been around racing for nearly 50 years and he had the opinion that cars were too strong. When it comes to safety, pretty much every idea is considered and Humpy came up with an idea of his own: The Humpy Bumper.\\n\\n\\n\\nTeaming with an engineer from Las Vegas named Paul Lew, Humpy helped design a bumper insert that would absorb much of an accident\\'s impact. Made from carbon fiber, the \"Humpy Bumper\" as it was known, would attach at the frame rails and go across the nose of the car in front of the radiator. The safety device would remain hidden from view, covered by the front valence and existing sheet metal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We need to eliminate totally the lethal part of this sport, and that\\'s what everybody\\'s objective should be,\" Wheeler said in an interview with the Roanoke Times. \"If it isn\\'t, they need to change their objective. I don\\'t think we\\'ll ever eliminate injury because this is a contact, high-speed sport, but I do think we can eliminate the lethal part of it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWheeler and Lew Showing the Bumper\\'s Strength (Pete McCole / autoracing1.com)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Humpy Bumper was officially unveiled at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, three days before the track hosted the 2001 All-Star Race. Weighing 16 pounds and costing less than $6,000 each, the device was designed for crashes at a 20-30 degree frontal impact.\\n\\n\\n\\nThroughout the summer, testing on the bumper was done with computer simulations and sled-crash tests at the University of Dayton Research Institute and General Motors. The final spectacle came on August 28th when an actual crash test using a Cup Series race car occurred at Charlotte in front of members of the media. To show the bumper\\'s effectiveness, a white Chevy Monte Carlo race car was driven by remote control into the Charlotte wall at 40 miles per hour. However, while Humpy thought the test showed damage to the car was reduced with the bumper, NASCAR still wasn\\'t convinced. They would not allow use of the bumper for the 2001 season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Crash Test Done at Charlotte (AP Photo / LJWorld.com)\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That is just unrealistic, not realistic at all,\" NASCAR Vice President, Jim Hunter told CNN/SI shortly after the test. Unfortunately, only 37 days after the crash test at Charlotte, another driver would lose his life against that same wall.\\n\\n\\n\\nBattling for the lead with four laps to go in the ARCA race at Charlotte, Blaise Alexander made contact with Kerry Earnhardt. Alexander\\'s Pontiac hit the wall with the same head-on impact the Humpy Bumper sought to minimize. Alexander did not wear a head restraint device and he died of the same basilar skull fracture that killed four other drivers in the past year and a half. For Paul Lew and Humpy Wheeler, men who developed a device they felt could prevent deaths like this, they were outraged that their product wasn\\'t taken more seriously.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I and every one here at Lew Composites send our heartfelt sympathy to the Alexander family because we are very passionate about motorsports and we have several engineers here who are personal friends of Blaise,\" Paul Lew said in a statement. \"If this doesn\\'t make NASCAR approve the bumper, then they are acting irresponsibly because (the use of the bumper) would greatly swing the driver\\'s odds of survival in his favor.\" Wheeler too added his outrage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Action has to be taken quickly because this could happen again tomorrow, it could happen Sunday, it could happen next week,\" said Wheeler. \"It has just got to stop. I have lost patience with the people in this industry who are dragging their feet. I\\'m sick of it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNASCAR did respond to Alexander\\'s death by making head restraint systems mandatory for all drivers. However, they didn\\'t feel the Humpy Bumper would make any difference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The data that is available and testing that has been done do not allow us to draw any conclusions that are meaningful because of speed at which the tests have been done will not allow us to,\" said NASCAR senior vice president, George Pyne. Humpy obviously felt that was incorrect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"With all due respect to NASCAR\\'s \\'experts,\\' we obviously need to do a better job of explaining how this energy-absorbing bumper works,\" Wheeler said. \"The difficulty in understanding this bumper is that it is made of directional carbon fiber. Only five percent of all carbon fiber usage is directional. Therefore, only those who work closely with it really understand its remarkable ability to redirect energy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the HANS Device was made mandatory and the SAFER barrier was installed on all tracks, safety improvements made something like the Humpy Bumper unnecessary. Quietly, it faded into the past. Perhaps if other areas of safety hadn\\'t improved, it would have had merrit. But today the Humpy Bumper has no more significance than a quirky oddity in the search for safety.\\n\\n\\n\\n-----------\\n\\nFollow me on Twitter @nascarman_rr for more articles and other old pictures.

       " \"Years from now the Oculus Rift I hold in my hand will gather dust in your attic. You’ll stumble across it like your very first mobile phone. I can’t believe how big this thing was, you’ll say. How the hell did I walk around with this thing strapped to my head?\\n\\nYou’ll say these things because the technology housed within this clunky device — with its low resolution, its cables that tie you in knots — will be as common and essential as a modern smart phone. It’ll be something everyone recognises. It will be a device that transforms so quickly, evolves so rapidly, that you’ll barely be able to keep pace. It will be streamlined and accessible, it will be overdesigned or under-designed depending on what happens to be fashionable at that specific time. In five years time the Oculus Rift I hold in my hand right now will look and feel like a lumbering brachiosaurus.\\n\\nAnd this is not a criticism; quite the opposite. It’s the highest compliment I can pay to a piece of technology that I expect will change lives and almost certainly transform the way we play video games in the very near future.\\n\\nThe Oculus Rift feels like the beginning of something actually incredible.\\n\\nStrangely, it’s the moments when you’re dragged out of the experience that reminds you how potent the Oculus Rift can be.\\n\\nI’m staring down at the ocean; I quickly shift round. In the real world I lift my hands, but I can’t see them. It’s instantly disorientating. Consciously I am aware that my own hands will not appear in this virtual simulation, but sub-consciously I expect them to exist in this space. That’s the dissonance right there.\\n\\nWhoah. This is not real. It's unreal.\\n\\nBut the dissonance only serves to highlight how ‘immersive’ the Oculus Rift experience is. In video game writing ‘immersive’ is a dead, lifeless word, but we must use it to describe this experience because no other word will suffice. ‘Immersive’: the adjective has a new weight and meaning through the existence of the Oculus Rift.\\n\\nHere’s another example. As a test my friends placed a chair in real life relative to the point where a virtual chair existed in the virtual world. They placed an object on it and asked me to pick it up. As I leaned forward to pick it up I didn’t move forward in the virtual world like I did in the real world — obviously. The disorientation of these conflating worlds was significant, to the point where my brain tried to compensate. My brain tried to tell me that the chair was actually moving away from me.\\n\\nMind bending.\\n\\nHere’s a simpler example: I’ve shown the Oculus Rift to a number of people now and every single person has attempted to walk forward in real life in order to move forward in the virtual world. And every single one felt disorientated, confused and weird when they continued to stand still.\\n\\nNow remember the first time you played Mario 64. For the first five minutes you forgot about the Princess, you couldn’t care less about Bowser, you just wanted to run in frantic, careless circles because you could, because that was possible.\\n\\nThe beauty of the Oculus Rift is the resurrection of that feeling; that precise same feeling. Something bewilderingly new; new enough that doing something silly and inconsequential feels like the most important thing you could be doing at that particular point in space and time.\\n\\nIronically it’s when playing traditional games — with traditional goals and traditional verbs — that the experience starts to lose its lustre. Playing Team Fortress 2, the instant I placed my hands on the mouse and keyboard the novelty of this strange new experience was sucked right up and out through my fingers. It was all too easy to remember I was playing a video game; all too easy to slip into the same old routines.\\n\\nIt’s hard to say precisely what the Oculus Rift will do for games, how it will change them, if at all. It’s a difficult discussion to have but I will say this: the Rift brings out the game designer in all of us. Everyone I showed it to removed the device with a crazed look and an idea for how it might be used. Every. Single. One.\\n\\nI can’t wait until I can do this, shoot a gun, move with my feet, explore this type of world, do this thing. They should make a game that lets you this.\\n\\nThey should, they could. Hopefully they will.\\n\\nThat’s the power of the Oculus Rift — it removes the strait jacket and sends your imagination spiralling in multiple different directions at once, towards multiple different stratospheres. Every single person who has received this device in the mail over the last week has opened the box with wide eyes and a giddy feeling in their gut. Every single one of them has an idea for a game and I can’t wait to see if they can transform these wonderful possibilities into a (virtual) reality.\",\n",
       " 'The OpenBSD project has released the first portable version of LibreSSL, the team\\'s OpenSSL fork – meaning it can be built for operating systems other than OpenBSD.\\n\\nThe LibreSSL project, which aims to clean up the buggy and inscrutable OpenSSL code, was founded about two months ago by a group of OpenBSD developers, so it only makes sense that getting it running on that OS would be their priority.\\n\\nWith the release of LibreSSL 2.0.0 on Friday, however, many of the dependencies on OpenBSD have been removed and the library can now be built for various flavors of Linux, Solaris, OS X, and FreeBSD.\\n\\nNote that this is still considerably fewer platforms that the original OpenSSL library supported. But OpenSSL\\'s portability approach had become one of extreme overkill, with the code incorporating numerous hacks and workarounds to make it run on such outdated platforms as VMS, OS/2, NetWare, 16-bit Windows, and even DOS.\\n\\nBy comparison, LibreSSL is focusing on Unix-like operating systems for now, although a Windows port may appear in the future.\\n\\nIn a presentation given in May, LibreSSL developer Bob Beck explained that much of the initial work on LibreSSL involved deleting code that only existed to provide support for oddball systems. Between that effort and removing redundant and unused code, the LibreSSL group was able to shrink the size of the OpenSSL codebase by about 23 per cent.\\n\\nThe LibreSSL developers have also worked to get OpenSSL\\'s unorthodox and inconsistent source code into \"kernel normal form\" (KNF), a standard C coding style used by the OpenBSD project.\\n\\nIn addition, although the goal of the LibreSSL project is to create a secure, drop-in replacement for OpenSSL, the developers have also tried to undo some of the OpenSSL developers\\' more ill-advised design decisions.\\n\\nFor example, the OpenSSL library relies on a quirky custom memory-management layer that behaves in strange ways, which makes it impossible to audit the code with tools designed to flag memory management problems. The LibreSSL team has been replacing this code with new routines that use memory allocation routines from the standard C library, making it far easier to spot bugs.\\n\\nThe portable version of LibrSSL 2.0.0 is available now from the LibreSSL directory of the various OpenBSD mirror sites around the globe.\\n\\nMeanwhile, work continues on a parallel effort to clean up the original OpenSSL code base, a project that has been sponsored by the Linux Foundation, among others. The LibreSSL project, on the other hand, says it has yet to receive a stable commitment of funding. ®',\n",
       " \"Few places in the world combine the jaw-dropping scenery, unpolluted skies, deep-rooted culture, and astonishing heritage as Greenland. But make no mistake, traveling here isn't easy — the prices are steep, there's relatively few flights and reliable roads, and the desirable seasons are short. However, one glimpse at the relatively untouched landscape and you'll be scrambling for your camera faster than you can say dancing aurora. With more and more cruise lines adding Greenland as a stop and murmurs in the travelsphere about new Northern Light tours, this unspoiled land won't be a secret much longer. That means, it's time to pack your bags and head to the Arctic's last frontier.\\n\\n\\n\\nEpic Kayaking A primary mode of transportation along Greenland's weaving waterways for decades, kayaking is arguably one of the biggest cultural symbols of the country. As a result, you can find rental companies in almost all the major cities from Nuuk to Ilulissat. Although local residents kayak 365 days a year, the best time to hit the water is from May through September when the wildlife is out in full force and the temperatures aren't as icy. The ultimate way to get up close to the rugged glaciers, craggy icebergs and frolicking critters, keep your eyes peeled for everything from whales to seals.\\n\\n\\n\\nStaggering Icebergs Most of the stark, blue hued icebergs found scattered in the oceans surround Greenland's west coast. Concentrated near the small seaside town of Iluissat at the Icefjord (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), you can see thousands of these floating wonders protruding from the icy waters. Further north, the cluster of icebergs near Sermeq Kujalleq (the world's fastest moving glacier) makes the small town of Uummannaq a picture-perfect place to kayak. For the best contrast though, head to South Greenland, where you'll find brilliant glacial formations painted against lush green hills, turquoise waters and the colorful houses of Nanortalik and Qaqortoq.\\n\\n\\n\\nCharming Towns The largest city in Greenland, Nuuk, has only 17,000 permanent residents. But despite it's size, it still offers all the charms of a larger capitol, with everything from art museums to hiking trails. Outside of Nuuk, the villages are considerably smaller, most home to just 2,000 - 4,000 permanent residents. Ilulissat is a must visit to catch a glimpse of the famous icefjord. The city sprawls along the coast of western Greenland with cobalt, red, yellow, and green homes quietly dotting the shore. A little further south, Qaqortoq offers a peaceful getaway with Danish style homes. Right outside town is one of the oldest Norse settlements with artifacts and the Hvalsey Church which dates back to the 14th century. Other villages that deserve a visit, if only for the photography opportunities, are Sisimiut, the second-largest city in the country and Aasiaat, whose buildings tower and flow down the hills and mountainside.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Rich Culture Living in some of the harshest climates, the people of Greenland are, not surprisingly, incredibly strong, resilient and resourceful. More than that, though, they're warm and welcoming, and embrace their unique heritage. To see what life is like in the one of northernmost places in the world, explore Qaanaaq, a tight-knit community with a deep-rooted history and passionate Inuit culture. The Thule people settled in Greenland's upper peninsula around the 9th century AD and formed what was formerly called Thule. They passed down traditions of fishing, kayaking, and dog sledding which can still be seen to this day. In other parts of Greenland, you'll find that most residents have a unique blend of Inuit and Danish blood, and both lineages can be seen in their crafts — from hunting to kaffemiks (a Danish inspired coffee house).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Northern Lights Thanks to its location, the Aurora Borealis, or the Northern Lights, can be seen from October through April in most parts of the country. You don't need to venture all the way up north to get the best viewing either. Some of the most dramatic skies can be seen outside of Kangerlussuaq, the town where the largest airport can be found. The vibrant colors illuminate the dark Arctic sky with radiant hues of green, purple, red and blue. To see them, simply book two to three nights and venture outside around midnight — the prime time to spot their dazzling glow. Conversely, in the warmer months, you'll be privy to the phenomenon of the Midnight Sun.\\n\\n\\n\\nInsane Hikes The most alluring aspect of Greenland is that you don't need to venture far to get lost in the great outdoors. The size of western Europe with barely the population of one country, the amount of backcountry exploration Greenland offers is unparalleled. What also makes this country incredibly unique is that there's no privately owned land at all - meaning anywhere is free game when it comes to hiking. If you don't want to forge your own path in the beautiful, albeit harsh nature - head to the Arctic Circle Trail, a 99-mile hike that connects Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut. The full-trip takes about 8 - 9 days and requires some challenging terrain and passages. For those in east Greenland, simply head for the icebergs in the Ammassalik area. Deep gorges, tall peaks and staggering climbs make this one of the most difficult treks in the country, but the panoramic views and Inuit villages of Kulusuk and Tasiilaq are worth it.\\n\\n\\n\\nJaw-Dropping Scenery From expansive, sweeping horizons to towering, rugged mountain ranges overlooked by craggy icebergs, the scenery in Greenland is diverse as they come. In the east, you'll find lush flower-filled meadows and massive basalt walls. While in the North, you're met by stark, snow-capped fjords and rocky hills flanked by brightly painted villages. Regardless of where you go, head out around sunset, when the deep polar sun dips into the Arctic Circle, painting the sky a dramatic pink, purple and orange.\\n\\n\\n\\nIncredible Wildlife The vast wilderness isn't just home to spectacular scenery — it's home to an impressive array of endemic species as well. That includes polar bears, walruses, musk ox, caribou, arctic foxes, whales, hares, eagles, lemmings and the rare Arctic wolf. So how do you spot these creatures in their natural habitat? Take a small expedition cruise for the chance to watch the humpback whales breech 40 feet into the air and pods of orcas zip by. On land, a hike will likely bring sightings of polar bears, arctic foxes, and wolves, but be sure to keep your distance. A visit to Greenland National Park will introduce you to the Musk Oxen, or Ummimak. These long-bearded beauties weigh up to 400 pounds and can camouflage themselves amongst the dark rocks.\",\n",

       " 'Cliffside coal plant in Cliffside, North Carolina. (Photo: Rainforest Action Network)Clean energy opponents turned to dirty tactics this week at the North Carolina legislature to advance a bill repealing the state’s groundbreaking renewable power program.\\n\\nIn a contested vote that led to an outcry from Democrats, the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday advanced a measure to roll back the 2007 state law requiring electric utilities to generate a modest amount of energy from renewable sources including solar, wind, and livestock methane — 12.5 percent of total retail sales by 2021 and thereafter.\\n\\nThe vote brought back to life a bill that appeared near death in the House last week, when the Public Utilities Committee rejected companion legislation sponsored by its own chair, Republican Rep. Mike Hager of Rutherford County, in a bipartisan vote of 18-13.\\n\\nThough Hager said he would keep bringing up his bill for re-votes in his committee, he didn’t this week, leading observers to assume he still doesn’t have support for passage. But the Senate version of the legislation, SB 365, was taken up later that day in the Finance Committee, whose members include Republican Sen. Andrew Brock of a Mocksville, a political consultant who is the bill’s sole sponsor.\\n\\nThe measure advanced — but there are questions about whether the repeal’s supporters actually won the vote. Senate Finance Committee co-chair Bill Rabon (R-Southport) refused requests to count a show of hands. In protest of the voice vote, the bill’s opponents shouted “No!” Many observers thought the vote was too close to call.\\n\\nAfterwards, some Democrats condemned the process.\\n\\nDemocratic Sen. Martin Nesbitt of Buncombe County, who voted against the renewables repeal bill in committee, brought up the vote later that day during the full Senate session.\\n\\n“It looks very bad to the public,” he told his colleagues, adding that it appears “the vote was called the wrong way.”\\n\\nAlso protesting the vote was Democratic Sen. Josh Stein of Raleigh, who also voted against the bill in committee.\\n\\n“North Carolina is not a banana republic,” Stein told The News & Observer. “That was no way to run a proceeding.”\\n\\nThe bill now moves to the Senate Commerce Committee for further consideration.\\n\\nFossil fuel interests behind renewables repeal effort\\n\\nDuring the public legislative hearings held to date on the renewables repeal bill, it’s been overwhelmingly opposed by speakers. They’ve included owners of renewable energy businesses, who have pointed to the thousands of jobs created in the state by the existing law, as well as livestock farmers who have invested in solar and methane generation systems. At the same time, a recent poll found that over 80 percent of the state’s voters support renewable energy initiatives — 89 percent of Democrats, 82 percent of independents, and 76 percent of Republicans.\\n\\nThe renewables repeal has also met resistance from Republican legislative leaders, including Rep. Ruth Samuelson of Charlotte. She’s considered a likely candidate to replace Rep. Thom Tillis of Cornelius as House Speaker.\\n\\nSo why is the bill still alive? The measure is being pushed by a coalition of 16 influential state and national conservative advocacy groups — many with financial ties to the fossil-fuel industry.\\n\\nOne of the most outspoken proponents of repealing renewable energy laws in North Carolina and elsewhere has been Americans for Prosperity, a Virginia-based conservative advocacy group that was founded in 2004 with the support of oil billionaires David and Charles Koch of Koch Industries. The Kochs’ family foundations are also major funders of AFP, a key player in the conservative tea party movement.\\n\\nOther coalition members with fossil-fuel industry connections include:\\n\\n* American Commitment. Run by a former vice president of Americans for Prosperity, this conservative advocacy group promotes the Keystone XL Pipeline project at KeystoneXLNow.com. Koch Industries told Canadian regulators that it has “direct and substantial interest” in the Keystone project. It has also run ads claiming President Obama is waging a “war on coal.” Because it is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, it does not have to disclose its donors.\\n\\n* American Energy Alliance. This group promotes what it calls “free market energy policies,” including oil and gas drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It was founded in 2008 by Thomas Pyle, who previously lobbied for Koch Industries and the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association.\\n\\n* American Legislative Exchange Council. This influential group brings together conservative lawmakers and corporations to craft and promote model state legislation, including a bill to repeal renewable energy laws. The Koch foundations and company are major funders of ALEC as are other fossil fuel interests including Energy Future Holdings, Exxon Mobil and Peabody Energy.\\n\\n* American Tradition Institute. ATI’s founding was financed by a Colorado petroleum fortune heir whose family sold their company to William Koch, the brother of Koch Industries’ David and Charles Koch. ATI has long pressed to end North Carolina’s renewables program, and it has been a leading voice of climate science denial at the legislature. Last year the group lost a controversial lawsuit that sought to force the University of Virginia to release the emails of former professor Michael Mann, a leading climatologist who it has tried to discredit.\\n\\n* Competitive Enterprise Institute. A free-market think tank and advocacy group, CEI is known for its misleading use of science to argue against the reality of global warming. It has received funding from the Koch foundations as well as the Amoco Foundation and Texaco.\\n\\n* The Heartland Institute. This conservative think tank has been a leading proponent of climate science denial, likening people who accept the scientific reality of global warming to Unabomber terrorist Ted Kaczynski, and it teamed up with ALEC to write model legislation reversing state renewable energy standards. The group has received funding from the Koch foundations as well as Exxon Mobil.\\n\\n* The Independent Women’s Forum. IWF is a free-market advocacy group that used to be affiliated with Americans for Prosperity, sharing staff and resources, and is funded by the Koch family foundations. In 2010, it launched a group called Balanced Education for Everyone that advocated an end to teaching about global warming, which it calls “junk science,” in U.S. schools.\\n\\n* The National Center for Public Policy Research. This conservative policy group promotes denial of global warming, comparing acceptance of climate science to belief in religion. It’s received over $400,000 in funding from Exxon Mobil.\\n\\nOther members of the anti-renewables coalition are the American Conservative Union, which issues influential ratings of state lawmakers; Americans for Tax Reform, an anti-tax advocacy group headed by Grover Norquist, a former lobbyist for the electric power industry and BP; the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, a free-market policy group that promotes climate science denial; Freedom Action, a web-based activist group affiliated with the Competitive Enterprise Institute; the John W. Pope Civitas Institute and John Locke Foundation, North Carolina-based think tanks that promote global warming denial; and the National Taxpayers Union, which has close ties to ALEC.\\n\\nMost of the North Carolina lawmakers pushing to repeal the state’s renewable energy law have ties to coalition groups.\\n\\nAs Facing South has reported previously, three of the four primary sponsors of the House version of the renewables repeal bill — Rep. Hager, Rep. Marilyn Avila (R-Wake), and Rep. George Cleveland (R-Onslow) are affiliated with ALEC. In addition, Rep. Avila is a former staff member of the John Locke Foundation, also part of the anti-renewables coalition.\\n\\nBrock, the Senate bill’s sponsor, previously worked for Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE). That group was founded in 1984 when Charles and David Koch asked Rich Fink — now executive vice president at Koch Industries — to develop a plan for an organization that could effectively advocate for free-market policies. Koch Industries and the Koch family foundations were the group’s major funders.\\n\\nIn 2003, a rift between CSE and its affiliated foundation led to a split. The foundation took a new name: Americans for Prosperity.\\n\\nTrading bananas for fossil fuels?\\n\\nThe phrase “banana republic” was coined by the writer O. Henry to describe a fictional country ruled by wealthy elites in which the national legislature is for sale.\\n\\nWhile North Carolina might not be a banana republic, as state Sen. Stein pointed out, the debate over the state’s energy policy has revealed disturbing signs that the democratic process is being abused for the benefit of well-heeled interests — and the renewables repeal bill is not the only example of the problem.\\n\\nLast year when the legislature was voting on an override of former Democratic Gov. Beverly Perdue’s veto of a bill legalizing fracking in the state, for example, the measure ended up passing by one vote. However, Democratic state Rep. Becky Carney of Mecklenburg County mistakenly pushed the wrong button and voted for the override, and the House leadership refused to let her correct her vote.\\n\\nIt later came to light that Rep. Hager, then Republican freshman leader and sponsor of the fracking law, tried to arrange for the veto override vote to take place while a key Democrat — whose district will be affected by fracking — was off the floor.\\n\\nHager recently told The News & Observer that he was not above turning to similar tactics to pass the renewables repeal bill:\\n\\nThe former Duke Energy engineer said he hopes some lawmakers switch votes and others miss the meeting; he won’t decide whether he’ll put his bill to another vote until the last minute Wednesday. “It’s all about the numbers,” Hager explained. “It’s all about who has the incentive to be there.”\\n\\nThe problem of powerful energy interests manipulating the democratic process to their benefit is not limited to North Carolina’s legislature, either.\\n\\nThis week the N.C. Mining and Energy Commission — the state body charged with drawing up fracking regulations — was prepared to approve its first rule governing public disclosure of chemicals in fracking fluids. But shortly before the scheduled May 2 vote, commissioners were informed the rule was being changed.\\n\\nThe reason? Fracking giant Halliburton objected, telling state regulators the rule went too far.',\n",
       " 'KENT, Ohio — Kambiz Ghazinour would love to persuade more of his Kent State University computer science students to go on to graduate school, but they’re so in demand that most of them head straight into the job market.\\n\\n“As soon as possible, they join the workforce and pay back their student loans, and I don’t blame them,” said Ghazinour, an assistant professor who teaches data privacy and related topics on this campus less than 40 miles from where the Republicans will hold their national convention this month.\\n\\nThe fact that computer science grads are more likely to have jobs waiting could give them advantages over their classmates if presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump is elected president.\\n\\nEchoing bipartisan calls for stricter accountability at colleges whose graduates are not always prepared for the working world, the Trump campaign has proposed tying student loan decisions to borrowers’ job prospects — an assessment that likely would be based on a student’s major.\\n\\nPrivate banks and colleges would make those decisions together, Sam Clovis, a co-chair of Trump’s campaign and an economics professor at Iowa’s Morningside College, said in an interview.\\n\\nComputer scientists probably would have little trouble borrowing money, but French majors might encounter challenges. Banks would be free to tailor loans based on students’ career paths, Clovis said. He emphasized that the main idea is to give borrowers better information about whether they’ll be able to pay back their loans.\\n\\n“You need to have a very clear picture of the actuaries in your field,” Clovis said of students. “If they choose to borrow the money, they have to pay it back. It’s that simple.”\\n\\nRelated: In era of high costs, humanities come under attack\\n\\nThe idea comes as Congress, the White House and others try to prod colleges into being more transparent about graduates’ job prospects.\\n\\n“If you ask the public what’s most important in higher education, they say two things: ‘What does it cost?’ and ‘Will my kid get a job?’ ” Anthony Carnevale, director, Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce\\n\\nIn some ways, Trump’s proposal is “a centrist Republican and Democratic position,” said Anthony Carnevale, a Georgetown University economics professor and director of Georgetown’s Center on Education and the Workforce.\\n\\n“If you ask the public what’s most important in higher education, they say two things: ‘What does it cost?’ and ‘Will my kid get a job?’ ”\\n\\nAnd while the unemployment rate for all new bachelor’s degree recipients dropped from 7.1 percent in March 2011 to 4.2 percent in March 2016, for new arts, law and public policy graduates it was 8.5 percent, according to Carnevale and fellow Georgetown researcher Ban Cheah. Meanwhile, the jobless rate for recent graduates in health fields dropped to 4.6 percent. The figures are from 2014, the most recent available.\\n\\nPresumptive US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (R) and Indiana Governor Mike Pence (L) take the stage during a campaign rally at Grant Park Event Center in Westfield, Indiana, on July 12, 2016.\\n\\nThat last number bodes well for 18-year-old Rachel Dalton, an incoming nursing student at Kent State. But while Trump’s plan would make it easy for Dalton to borrow money, she said her artist friends shouldn’t suffer just because they’re following their dreams.\\n\\n“To me, college is all about becoming an adult,” Dalton said outside a Kent State dining hall as she took a break from summer freshman orientation on the Ohio campus. “There’s a lot more than just getting an education. If people want to do astrophysics or fashion, they should do what they want.”\\n\\nSome advocates for the liberal arts agree that connecting employment and financial aid would unfairly target the humanities, in which graduates’ unemployment numbers tend to be higher and income lower than those of their peers immediately after graduation.\\n\\nBut while a history major might have trouble finding a job right out of school, these advocates say, his or her degree may end up paying off years later.\\n\\nBy the time they’re at the peak of their careers, in their mid-50s, people who majored as undergraduates in the humanities or social sciences earn about $2,000 a year more than their classmates who majored in professional or pre-professional fields, a report by the Association of American Colleges and Universities found. About 40 percent of humanities undergrads go on to get advanced degrees, the report said, further boosting their incomes.\\n\\n“You really don’t know the value of your degree until 20 to 30 years out,” said Kent State provost Todd Diacon, noting that his Latin American history degree did not bring in a sizable salary until he became a university administrator. “I’m skeptical of our ability to predict. I try not to pick winners.”\\n\\nRelated: While liberal arts decline in U.S., China and other economic rivals add them\\n\\nAt Cleveland’s Case Western Reserve University, history associate professor Gillian Weiss routinely invites physicians, CEOs and lawyers who majored in the humanities to visit with current students who she said need to see that a humanities degree opens doors to just about any field.\\n\\nWhile the unemployment rate for all new bachelor’s degree recipients is about 4 percent, it’s double that for graduates with arts degrees.\\n\\n“Part of the purpose of a liberal arts education is to learn to think about the world,” Weiss said, calling the Trump employment-based financial aid proposal “incredibly short-sighted.” Many lower-income students already feel pressure to go into fields with high employment, she said, even though they might want to study history or literature. “There’s already a class differential in who feels the luxury to study what they want to study.”\\n\\nCase Western chemistry professor Alfred Anderson was even more blunt in his disdain for the idea: “I think people should do what they want. It’s a free country.”\\n\\nJust a few blocks from where Republicans will gather to choose a candidate, Cleveland State University has embraced its role in the Ohio economy as the trainer of a skilled workforce by focusing on health fields and other disciplines with high employment demand. The school recently axed low-enrollment departments such as geology in favor of programs like criminal justice, President Ronald Berkman said.\\n\\nRelated: Study backs liberal arts, but questions graduates’ competence\\n\\nBut while Berkman said he sees merit in another Trump proposal to return student lending to private banks rather than leaving it to the federal government, he said he worries about the consequences of going so far as to tie those loans to students’ majors.\\n\\n“No student who is qualified to go to a university should be denied a chance to attend on the basis that they can’t afford to pay,” he said in his office on the urban campus. “Personally, I wouldn’t want my kid, because they’re a history major, to have less opportunity than other students.”\\n\\nScores of educators, experts and politicians have argued that colleges at least need to do a better job of telling potential students about the likely payoffs of their degrees. If a student and their family are paying tens of thousands of dollars per year to study anthropology, they should have some idea about the job prospects.\\n\\nThat information just isn’t available at most schools, said Mamie Voight, director of policy research at the Institute for Higher Education Policy in Washington. But it should be, she said.\\n\\n“It’s important to improve the data we have available for students to know the return on investment so they can make better decisions,” she said. “It’s important for students to go in with their eyes open.”\\n\\nMajors without apparent career payoffs have been a particular target of some Republicans. The Republican governors of Florida, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Kentucky have publicly questioned whether taxpayers should subsidize humanities disciplines. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, during his own campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, said there was a greater need for welders than philosophers.\\n\\nOn Ohio campuses as the convention neared, few students seemed worried about their post-graduation outlooks.\\n\\nRelated: The surprising institutions that refuse to drop the liberal arts\\n\\nCase Western Reserve senior Evangelina Din, 21, is majoring in cognitive science and psychology with a pre-med focus. Although she’s long wanted to be a doctor, she said she’s not stressing out about jobs.\\n\\n“I’m not worried at all,” she said during a break in a quiet campus lounge. “If medical school doesn’t work out, I know I have other options.”\\n\\nAcross town at Cleveland State, 22-year-old senior Shane Shertzer said he became an accounting major mostly because of the job possibilities.\\n\\n“It definitely played a big part,” he said on a campus that had largely cleared out for summer break. “Everybody talked about how accountants make big money.”\\n\\nThis story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

       " '3D printing is at the center of a monumentally important, extremely controversial copyright infringement debate with global implications. This lawsuit that involves powerhouses like Google, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and the US International Trade Commission (ITC), a quasi-judicial, independent, bipartisan, federal agency that provides the legislative and executive branches of the government with trade information and expertise. The ITC basically polices trade in the interest of protecting US industries from unfair trade practices like subsidies, trademark, patent, and copyright infringement.\\n\\nThe ITC became involved in a dispute between Align Technology, Inc. and ClearCorrect Operating, LLC. Align’s process for creating its Invisalign® products — plastic teeth aligners (molds) that eliminate the need for metal braces — is patented. Align’s method involves scanning a client’s teeth and then converted the scans into digital files. The files are used to create 3D models of the plastic teeth aligners customized to fit the client perfectly. A series of molds are created, ideally via 3D printing, as the alignment process progresses.\\n\\nAlign’s patents cover the methods for producing the aligners rather than the objects themselves. Therefore, the use of the process, creation of the digital data sets, itself becomes an infringement of the patent before the final molds are ever produced. Align alleged that Texas-based ClearCorrect had violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which deals with unfair practices in import trade and allows the US government via the ITC to protect US intellectual property rights from foreign infringement. According to the lawsuit documents, ClearConnect produced the original teeth scans in the United States but subsequently sent the files to Pakistan. There, the digital data sets were converted to 3D models, which were then sent back to ClearConnect where the actual molds were 3D printed.\\n\\nAt the crux of the debate in the ITC case was whether or not the electronic transmission of the digital files could be considered an “importation of articles” within the interpretation of 19 USC § 1337 (US law code regarding unfair practices in import trade). The ITC received submissions on the subject from the MPAA and Google (among others), major players and, it should be noted, fierce opponents of one another, in the intellectual property and patent/copyright infringement debate. Ultimately, the ITC found (with only one dissenting vote) that the digital data sets, produced using Align’s patented method, must be considered “articles.”\\n\\nIn short, acts of infringement of digital patents need not be based on tangible “articles” or products. Probably pretty obviously, this decision by the ITC has tremendous implications where 3D printing technology is concerned. One of the extremely problematic aspects of this decision is that, while the ITC case involved two companies, with the greater availability via open source sites (among other venues) where digital files (like 3D models) are easily accessible and often at no cost, potential infringers will be individuals working on home computers printing their own aligners — or anything else, for that matter.\\n\\nIn an article from April 2014, Professor Lucas Osborn, director of the Intellectual Property Law Program at the Campbell School of Law in Raleigh, NC, sees two major issues among the many raised in the Align and ClearCorrect case. The first, he observes, relates to “how… patent law [should] treat claims directed to digital representations of physical objects.” The second issue, writes Osborn, is how “patent law [should] treat claims directed only to physical articles where the alleged infringement involves only or primarily digital renderings of the physical articles.” As Osborn points out, the patents owned by Align relate to the first issue. He urges companies who want to protect actual physical products to think seriously about “protecting digital versions of them as well.”\\n\\nPrior to the digital age, companies traditionally filed patent claims for physical objects. “Much as music and movie industries… battle digital copyright infringement, patent owners,” warns Osborn, “may be on the cusp of their own digital patent war.” Let’s say you create, refine, and then transmit a 3D file. You can basically do that now as easily as you can share an .mp3 file. Thanks to the Internet, 3D printing essentially decentralizes and, realistically, “anonymizes” the production of “tangible objects.” This begs the question of whether or not a court could then find that the use of the digital file is an infringement of a patent claim for the physical object. Osborn continues in a conclusion that is understandably open-ended:\\n\\n“If not, will claims of indirect infringement be an effective tool against the individuals and websites that host and transmit the CAD files (3D digital models)? These questions will be of increasing importance in an era of ubiquitous 3D printing technology.”\\n\\nThe issue is now almost irrevocably intertwined with the ongoing battle being spearheaded by the MPAA, with formidable opponents like Google, to curb copyright infringement to protect creative content from piracy and to limit the sharing of copyrighted works through peer-to-peer file sharing networks such as The Pirate Bay and Isohunt. Thwarted in its efforts to convince Congress to enact stronger legislation to fight copyright infringement and online trafficking of counterfeit goods via the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act, or PIPA), the MPAA is looking for non-legislative strategies. At stake, according to opponents of SOPA and PIPA, both of which are languishing in a fierce, partisan limbo for now, are free speech and future innovation. According to the prospective laws’ critics, PIPA and SOPA would give law enforcement far too much power to censor and expose neutral entities like libraries to prosecution.\\n\\nAnd what of 3D printers availing themselves of extant, online CAD files? As yet, infringement lines are ambiguous but we’ll keep you apprised of developments in this arena, which could potentially have enormous implications for the 3D printing industry.\\n\\nLet us know what you think about legislation in the 3D printing space. Tell us your thoughts in the US ITC Intellectual Property forum thread over at 3DPB.com.',\n",

If you answered “a” for “altruistic”, you’re a naïve idealist who wishes that someone out there is capable of true self-sacrifice.If you answered “b” for “bum”, you probably don’t give a sh**. If you answered “c” for conspiracy, you’re probably a conspiracy theorist. But you’d also be the only person who is correct.As the patron deity of Buddhism, the Dalai Lama is also a representative of the occurrences at his temples. It would be like the Pope trying to tell you that pedophile priests were a part and parcel of Catholicism and that there was really nothing he could do or say about it. Details.com speaks of the experiences of a boy….Last September, after a teaching session in Vancouver, someone in the audience asked Kalu about sexual abuse in the monasteries. He replied that he was sensitive to it because he had been molested.The boy’s name is Kalu Rinpoche, a reincarnated thingie of some long-dead person (aka randomly selected baby).He created a video titled “Confessions of Kalu Rinpoche,” he says that he was molested by elder monks… “sexually abused by elder monks,” and when he was 18 his tutor in the monastery threatened him at knife-point.“It’s all about money, power, controlling... And then I became a drug addict because of all this misunderstanding and I went crazy.”A gang of older monks who would visit his room each week… This was hard-core sex, he says, including penetration.“Most of the time, they just came alone,” he says.“They just banged the door harder, and I had to open. I knew what was going to happen, and after that you become more used to it.”It wasn’t until Kalu returned to the monastery after his three-year retreat that he realized how wrong this practice was. By then the cycle had begun again on a younger generation of victims, he says.Kalu’s claims of sexual abuse mirror those of Lodoe Senge, an ex-monk and 23-year-old tulku who now lives in Queens, New York.“When I saw the video,” Senge says of Kalu’s confessions, “I thought, ‘Shit, this guy has the balls to talk about it when I didn’t even have the courage to tell my girlfriend.'” Senge was abused, he says, as a 5-year-old by his own tutor, a man in his late twenties, at a monastery in India.Another interesting post was written by the Huffington Post. It is particularly notable because only the cached version is available It speaks of the experiences of a young girl, she too had been raped by monks. More surprising was the reaction of the authorities of the Tibetan community:As shocking as the alleged crime was the revelation that the Mundgod camp officer and settlement officer had encouraged the father of the child not to pursue criminal charges against the men. Why? Out of fear of shaming HH the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people.Widespread child abuse and even rape at his temples, yet he has very little to say on the matter… Yet another case of See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil.Australian paper The Age wrote a telling article that details the Dalai Lama’s secret life, long admitted by the CIA itself.The government set up in exile in India and, at least until the 1970s, received $US 1.7 million a year from the CIA.The money was to pay for guerilla operations against the Chinese, notwithstanding the Dalai Lama’s public stance in support of non-violence, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.The Dalai Lama himself was on the CIA’s payroll from the late 1950s until 1974, reportedly receiving $US 15,000 a month ($US 180,000 a year). [24 years X $180,000/year = $4,320,000]Yet another Nobel Peace Prize winner who advocates violence? A drone-striking president and a weapon-buying monk, clearly the Nobel committee isn’t just picking candidates based on how much pressure the political establishment was applying to it….The Dalai Lama has been remarkably nepotistic, appointing members of his family to many positions of prominence.In recent years, three of the six members of the Kashag, or cabinet, the highest executive branch of the Tibetan government-in-exile, have been close relatives of the Dalai Lama.An older brother served as chairman of the Kashag and as the minister of security. He also headed the CIA-backed Tibetan contra movement in the 1960s.A sister-in-law served as head of the government-in-exile’s planning council and its Department of Health.A younger sister served as health and education minister and her husband served as head of the government-in-exile’s Department of Information and International Relations.Their daughter was made a member of the Tibetan parliament in exile. A younger brother has served as a senior member of the private office of the Dalai Lama and his wife has served as education minister.The second wife of a brother-in-law serves as the representative of the Tibetan government-in-exile for northern Europe and head of international relations for the government-in-exile.All these positions give the Dalai Lama’s family access to millions of dollars collected on behalf of the government-in-exile.So, his “government in exile” is basically his immediate family? Sounds real legitimate, Mr Lama. It gets better:Contrary to widespread belief, he is not a vegetarian. He eats meat. He has done so (he claims) on a doctor’s advice following liver complications from hepatitis. I have checked with several doctors but none agrees that meat consumption is necessary or even desirable for a damaged liver.You want to know his real reason for eating meat? It tastes good. Who cares if, according to Buddhism, this piece of roast beef was the reincarnated remains of one’s own grandpa? Does he even believe in the practices he is espousing?The CIA wasn’t just his chief financier, it had trained the few men willing to fight for him as well according to a Newsweek article Help was on the way. In 1958 more than 30 Tibetans began training secretly at Camp Hale, not far from Leadville, Colorado.Here about 300 Tibetans in all – assigned names like “Jack,” “Rocky” and “Martin” – were schooled in the black arts of covert warfare, from spy photography and sabotage to Morse code and mine-laying.“We had great expectations when we went to America; we thought perhaps they would even give us an atom bomb to take back with us,” said one trainee, Tenzin Tsultrim.The final nail in the coffin is a letter penned by either his “Holiness” or his entourage, sent to the CIA and revealed by a FOIA request It states that “Chinese Communists are firing about 2000 artillery shells per day. They have fired big guns and done very bad damage… Please send us weapons for 30,000 men by airplane”To be fair, Mr Lama claims to be unaware of any of the CIA shenanigans until much later. Alas, words are wind and facts remain facts. After all, it is the easiest thing in the world to be a vegetarian pacifist… As long as you get to eat meat and wage war that is.\",\n",

       " \"In the wake of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s unfortunate death, several liberal groups — including the media favorite, People for the American Way — are pushing the Obama Administration to quickly nominate a like-minded justice. And the groups all have something in common.\\n\\nMoney.\\n\\nCombined, Soros and the Ford Foundation (not connected to Ford Motor Company) gave at least $50 million, and possibly more, to organizations which hope to push the court further to the left through an Obama appointee.\\n\\nLiberal media are pushing the same agenda by criticizing the GOP for wanting to delay a nomination. CBS and NBC blasted ‘the Republican roadblock” that they claimed was an attempt to not “follow the Constitution” on Feb. 16. NBC also gushed that Democrats were “firing back” to support the “ironclad” Constitution.\\n\\nOn Feb. 17, 2016, The New York Times identified six of the liberal organizations behind the push to get an Obama nominee quickly confirmed. Nearly all of the groups, which ranged from People for the American Way to the League of Conservation Voters, have one donor in common: liberal billionaire George Soros (The sixth organization — Americans United for Change — does not disclose its donors). The Ford Foundation has given to at least three of those organizations as well.\\n\\nSince 2003, Soros gave $18,032,900 to People for the American Way, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and Alliance for Justice. The Ford Foundation gave an additional $28,907,564 to those same groups during the same time period.\\n\\nSoros donated an additional $3,500,000 to the liberal American Bridge 21st Century and League of Conservation Voters PACs, which are also pushing for a speedy Obama nomination.\\n\\nNot only do the groups have overlapping donors, their carefully crafted justice nomination rhetoric was also eerily similar.\\n\\nBetween Feb. 15, and Feb. 19, 2016, People for the American Way (PFAW), The American Bridge 21st Century PAC, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the Alliance For Justice (AFJ) all condemned so-called Republican “obstructionists” who would dare object to an Obama Supreme Court justice nominee.\\n\\nPeople for the American Way promoted a petition on its website telling senators to “do your job” by considering an Obama nominee. As of Feb. 19, 2016, it had more than 51,000 signatures. PFAW’s reach extends beyond just its readers, because the liberal media regularly turn to PFAW for hit jobs against conservatives. Soros gave PFAW $6,450,000 since 2003.\\n\\nAlliance for Justice, which has received $1,825,000 from Soros and $3,430,000 from the Ford Foundation, has its own Judicial Selection Project which claims to “ensure our courts are staffed with highly-qualified judges that will safeguard the rights of all Americans… not just the privileged few.”\\n\\nNan Aron, president of the AFJ, wrote articles for both The Nation Magazine and The Huffington Post in February 2016 to argue “\\ufeffwe already had an election to decide who gets to appoint the next supreme court justice,” and “we fully support President Obama's decision to exercise his constitutional duty to nominate a replacement.”\\n\\nAron is not new to supreme court nominee battles. More than 10 years ago, CBS highlighted his liberal criticisms of then-nominee John Roberts.\\n\\nThe Tides Foundation, a liberal dark-money machine, gave $91,296 directly to the AFJ Judicial Selection Project in 2011 and 2012.\\n\\nThe president of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Wade Henderson, issued a press release on Feb. 17, stating “The work of the United States Supreme Court is too important to the nation to allow a vacancy to go unfilled for an extended period of time.” Henderson went on to claim that Republicans in the senate are ”taking obstruction to new heights of cynicism and are flirting with a constitutional crisis of their own making.”\\n\\nIn 2012, the media appealed to Henderson to slam Republicans.\\n\\nSoros and several other liberal donors gave nearly $39 million combined to The Leadership Conference: The Ford Foundation ($24,555,633), Soros ($9,757,900), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ($3,811,021) and Tides Foundation ($369,000).\\n\\nSoros also gave $3,000,000 to the American Bridge 21st Century PAC, which took a new angle on slamming every GOP candidate by telling “obstructionist” Republicans in Congress to “step aside” and make room for senators who would approve an Obama nominee.\\n\\nFinally, The League of Conservation Voters, which rarely involves itself in the justice nomination process, has been actively contacting its 1.5 million members, asking them to push their senators to approve Obama’s nominee, according to The New York Times.\\n\\n“It’s hugely important that the president nominate someone and the Senate acts. We will be more engaged in this effort than we ever have before in a Supreme Court nomination,” the league’s president, Gene Karpinski told The Times.\\n\\nSoros gave the league $500,000 in 2014 and four of his children gave $20,000 in 2010, according to campaignmoney.org.\",\n",
       " 'With 57 days left until the November election, Republicans have a real chance to retain their Senate majority.\\n\\nThat’s a somewhat remarkable statement, given not only the built-in challenges for Senate Republicans this election but also the unforeseen hurdle presented by the emergence of Donald Trump as the party’s presidential nominee. And it’s due, in large part, to just two people: Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio).\\n\\nThe strengths of those candidacies — both Portman and Rubio are leading comfortably in Quinnipiac University polls released late last week — in such large and expensive states is the glue that, at the moment, is holding together Republicans’ dream of keeping the Senate. Without Rubio in Florida and Portman in Ohio, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) would already be moving his boxes into the Senate majority leader’s office.\\n\\nTake a step back and consider the challenge that the 2016 map poses for Republicans. The party is defending 24 seats this fall, compared with just 10 for Democrats. And it’s actually worse for Republicans than even those raw numbers suggest. Remember that this class of senators was elected in 2010 — a very good year to be Republican anywhere in the country. That national environment helped Republicans win in Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio and Florida, among other Democratic-leaning or swing states. Six years later, those incumbents are having to run not only in a presidential year — with its resultant turnout increases — but also in a year with Trump at the top of the ticket.\\n\\nThat math led many political handicappers to conclude that a Democratic takeover of the Senate was nearly inevitable in 2016. After all, Democrats need only a net four seats if Hillary Clinton is elected president and five if she isn’t to retake the majority. And with Wisconsin and Illinois virtually impossible holds for Republicans in a presidential year (especially with Trump at the top of the ticket), the whole thing seemed like a foregone conclusion.\\n\\nThen two things happened.\\n\\nThe first was that Rubio went back on his promise — made during his unsuccessful presidential bid — not to seek a second Senate term in 2016. Rubio’s reversal — days before the state’s filing deadline — was a huge moment for Senate Republicans.\\n\\nIn a single day, they went from a crowded Republican primary field in which none of the candidates had distinguished themselves to Rubio. (All of the GOP primary candidates with the exception of wealthy developer Carlos Beruff dropped out once Rubio got in.)\\n\\nFor all of the negative publicity Rubio got at the end of his presidential candidacy and his very public “Hamlet” act on running for the Senate again, the reality is that he is not only a very naturally talented candidate, but also one with considerable name identification in Florida and lots of access to the tens of millions of dollars necessary to run and win. Rubio’s candidacy not only gave Republicans a better-than-average shot to hold the seat, but also saved the party committee and its allied super PACs at least $20 million in spending to try to hold the seat.\\n\\nThe second major development was that Portman, who trailed former Ohio governor Ted Strickland (D) in early polls in the Senate race, showed that he is one of the most disciplined and just plain best candidates running for any office these days.\\n\\nRelentlessly and meticulously, Portman built his organization even as he and his aligned super PAC were ripping Strickland limb from limb via millions of dollars’ worth of TV ads painting his governorship as a failure. (Strickland lost his bid for a second term to John Kasich in 2010.)\\n\\nAs the summer went on, it became clear that Portman was not only catching Strickland but also lapping him in polls. (Portman has a double-digit lead over Strickland in the RealClearPolitics polling average.) Then came the death blow for Strickland: The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and the Senate Democratic super PAC announced that they were canceling weeks of planned ad buys on his behalf, a sign of rapidly eroding confidence in his chances of making up the ground he has lost to Portman.\\n\\n“Portman has run a damn fine race,” DSCC Executive Director Tom Lopach said at a trade association meeting last week in Washington. “The rest, I’ll have to tell you over a drink.”\\n\\nLike Rubio’s strength in Florida, Portman’s surge in Ohio means more than just a single Senate seat. If Republicans don’t need to spend the millions they probably had allocated for Portman in Ohio or for whoever their nominee was going to be in Florida, that frees up lots of money to spend in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Nevada and even, potentially, Arizona and Missouri.\\n\\nNone of the above is to argue that Republicans are sitting pretty in their quest to hold the Senate this November. A betting man would give Democrats a narrow edge. But the sole reason you can have a serious conversation about Republicans holding on to their majority shortly after Labor Day is because of Rubio and Portman. Every Republican should send them a “thank you” note.',\n",

If we teach GraphQL to a software application, that application will be able to declaratively communicate any data requirements to a backend data service that also speaks GraphQL.\\n\\nJust like a child can learn a new language fast, while a grown-up will have a harder time picking it up, starting a new application from scratch using GraphQL will be a lot easier than introducing GraphQL to a mature application.\\n\\nTo teach a data service to speak GraphQL, we need to implement a runtime layer and expose it to the clients who want to communicate with the service. Think of this layer on the server side as simply a translator of the GraphQL language, or a GraphQL-speaking agent who represents the data service.\\n\\nThis layer, which can be written in any language, defines a generic graph-based schema to publish the capabilities of the data service it represents. Client applications who speak GraphQL can query the schema within its capabilities. This approach decouples clients from servers and allows both of them to evolve and scale independently.\\n\\nA GraphQL request can be either a query (read operation) or a mutation (write operation). For both cases, the request is a simple string that a GraphQL service can interpret, execute, and resolve with data in a specified format. The popular response format that is usually used for mobile and web applications is the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).\\n\\nGraphQL Queries\\n\\nHere’s an example of a GraphQL query that a client can use to ask a server about the name and email of user #42:\\n\\n{\\n\\nuser(id: 42) {\\n\\nname,\\n\\nemail\\n\\n}\\n\\n}\\n\\nHere’s a possible JSON response for that query:\\n\\n{\\n\\n\"data\": {\\n\\n\"user\": {\\n\\n\"name\": \"John Doe\",\\n\\n\"email\": \"john@example.com\"\\n\\n}\\n\\n}\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe request and response in a GraphQL communication are related. A request determines the shape of its data response, and a data response can be used to easily construct its suitable request.\\n\\nGraphQL on the server is just a specification that defines various design principles, including a hierarchical structure, support of arbitrary code, a strong type system, introspective nature, and many more.\\n\\nGraphQL Mutations\\n\\nReading is just one of the four CRUD operations that a client can communicate to a server. Most clients will also communicate their need to update the data. In GraphQL, this can be done with Mutations.\\n\\nA GraphQL mutation is very similar to a GraphQL query, but with runtime awareness that resolving the mutation will have side effects on some elements of the data. A good GraphQL runtime implementation executes multiple GraphQL mutations in a single request in sequence one by one, while it executes multiple GraphQL queries in the same request in parallel.\\n\\nGraphQL fields, which we use in both queries and mutations, accept arguments. We use the arguments as data input for mutations. Here’s an example GraphQL mutation that can be used to add a comment to a post using markdown.\\n\\nmutation {\\n\\naddComment(\\n\\npostId: 42,\\n\\nauthorEmail: \"mark@fb.com\",\\n\\nmarkdown: \"GraphQL is clearly a **game changer***\"\\n\\n) {\\n\\nid,\\n\\nformattedBody,\\n\\ntimestamp\\n\\n}\\n\\n}\\n\\nI threw the markdown feature into the mix to demonstrate how a GraphQL mutation can handle both writing and reading at the same time. It’s just another function that we resolve on the server, but this function happens to do multiple things. It will persist the comment data that we received through the field arguments, and then it will read the database-generated timestamp, process the markdown of the comment, and return back a JSON object ready to be used to display that new comment in the UI. We will see an example of how to define a GraphQL mutation on the server in later posts.\\n\\nProblems and Concerns\\n\\nPerfect solutions are fairy tales. With the flexibility GraphQL introduces, a door opens on some clear problems and concerns.\\n\\nOne important threat that GraphQL makes easier is resource exhaustion attacks (AKA Denial of Service attacks). A GraphQL server can be attacked with overly complex queries that will consume all the resources of the server. It’s very simple to query for deep nested relationships (user -> friends -> friends …), or use field aliases to ask for the same field many times. Resource exhaustion attacks are not specific to GraphQL, but when working with GraphQL, we have to be extra careful about them.\\n\\nThere are some mitigations we can do here. We can do cost analysis on the query in advance and enforce some kind of limits on the amount of data one can consume, or a timeout to kill requests that take too long to resolve. Also, since GraphQL is just a resolving layer, we can handle the rate limits enforcement at a lower level under GraphQL.\\n\\nIf the GraphQL API endpoint we’re trying to protect is not public, and is meant for internal consumption of our own clients (web or mobile), then we can use a whitelist approach and pre-approve queries that the server can execute. Clients can just ask the servers to execute pre-approved queries using a query unique identifier. Facebook seems to be using this approach.\\n\\nAuthentication and authorization are other concerns that we need to think about when working with GraphQL. Do we handle them before, after, or during a GraphQL resolve process? To answer this question, think of GraphQL as a DSL (domain specific language) on top of our own backend data fetching logic. It’s just one layer that we could put between the clients and our actual data service (or multiple services). Think of authentication and authorization as another layer. GraphQL will not help with the actual implementation of the authentication or authorization logic; it’s not meant for that. However, if we want to put these layers behind GraphQL, we can use GraphQL to communicate the access tokens between the clients and the enforcing logic. This is very similar to the way we do authentication and authorization with RESTful APIs.\\n\\nOne other task that GraphQL makes a bit more challenging is client data caching. RESTful APIs are easier to cache because of their dictionary nature: this location gives that data. We can use the location itself as the cache key. With GraphQL, we can adopt a similar basic approach and use the query text as a key to cache its response. However, this approach is limited, not very efficient, and can cause problems with data consistency. The results of multiple GraphQL queries can easily overlap, and this basic caching approach would not account for the overlap.\\n\\nThere is a brilliant solution to this problem though. A Graph Query means a Graph Cache. If we normalize a GraphQL query response into a flat collection of records, giving each record a global unique ID, we can cache those records instead of caching the full responses. This is not a simple process though, there will be records referencing other records, and we will be managing a cyclic graph there. Populating and reading the cache will need query traversal. We need to code a layer to handle the cache logic. However, this method will overall be a lot more efficient than response-based caching. Relay.js is one framework that adopts this caching strategy and auto-manages it internally.\\n\\nFinally, and possibly the most important problem that we should be concerned about with GraphQL, is the problem that’s commonly referred to as N+1 SQL queries. GraphQL query fields are designed to be stand-alone functions, and resolving those fields with data from a database might result in a new database request per resolved field.\\n\\nFor a simple RESTful API endpoint logic, it’s easy to analyze, detect, and solve N+1 issues by enhancing the constructed SQL queries. For GraphQL dynamically resolved fields, it’s not that simple. However, there is one possible solution that Facebook is pioneering for this problem: DataLoader.\\n\\nAs the name implies, DataLoader is a utility one can use to read data from databases and make it available to GraphQL resolver functions. We can use DataLoader instead of reading the data directly from databases with SQL queries, and DataLoader will act as our agent to reduce the actual SQL queries we send to the database. DataLoader uses a combination of batching and caching to accomplish that. If the same client request resulted in a need to ask the database about multiple things, DataLoader can be used to consolidate these questions and batch-load their answers from the database. DataLoader will also cache the answers and make them available for subsequent questions about the same resources.',\n",

       " 'Kermit Barron Gosnell (born February 9, 1941) is an American former physician[2] and abortion provider who was convicted of murdering three infants who were born alive during attempted abortion procedures; he was also convicted of involuntary manslaughter of one woman during an abortion procedure.[3][4][5][6][7]\\n\\nGosnell owned and operated the Women\\'s Medical Society clinic in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and he was a prolific prescriber of OxyContin.[8] In 2011, Gosnell and various co-defendant employees were charged with eight counts of murder, 24 felony counts of performing illegal abortions beyond the state of Pennsylvania\\'s 24-week time limit, and 227 misdemeanor counts of violating the 24-hour informed consent law. The murder charges related to an adult patient, Karnamaya Mongar, who died following an abortion procedure, and seven newborns said to have been killed by having their spinal cords severed with scissors after being born alive during attempted abortions. In May 2013, Gosnell was convicted of first degree murder in the deaths of three of the infants and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar. Gosnell was also convicted of 21 felony counts of illegal late-term abortion, and 211 counts of violating the 24-hour informed consent law. After his conviction, Gosnell waived his right to appeal in exchange for an agreement by prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. He was sentenced instead to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[9][10]\\n\\nBackground and early career [ edit ]\\n\\nKermit Gosnell was born on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, the only child of a gas station operator and a government clerk[11] in an African-American family.[12] He was a student at the city\\'s Central High School from which he graduated in 1959.[13] Gosnell graduated from Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA with a bachelor\\'s degree.[14] Gosnell received his medical degree at the Jefferson Medical School in 1966.[13] It has been reported that he spent four decades practicing medicine among the poor, including opening the Mantua Halfway House, a rehab clinic for drug addicts in the impoverished Mantua neighborhood of West Philadelphia near where he grew up, and a teen aid program.[13] He became an early proponent of abortion rights in the 1960s and 1970s and, in 1972, he returned from a stint in New York City to open up an abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue in Mantua.[11][15] Gosnell told a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter in October 1972: \"as a physician, I am very concerned about the sanctity of life. But it is for this precise reason that I provide abortions for women who want and need them\".[16]\\n\\nIn the same year, he also performed fifteen televised second-trimester abortions, using an experimental \"Super Coil\" method invented by Harvey Karman. The coils were inserted into the uterus, where they caused irritation leading to the expulsion of the fetus. However, complications from the procedure were reported by nine of the women, with three of these reporting severe complications.[17][18]\\n\\nThe 1972 Inquirer article also said that Gosnell was a \"respected man\" in his community, a finalist for the Junior Chamber of Commerce\\'s \"Young Philadelphian of the Year\" because of his work directing the Mantua Halfway House.[16] By the late 1980s, however, public records showed state tax liens were piling up against the halfway house, and the abortion clinic had a $41,000 federal tax lien.[16]\\n\\nGosnell has been married three times. His third and current wife, Pearl, had worked at the Women\\'s Medical Society as a full-time medical assistant from 1982 until their marriage in 1990.[1] They have two children; the younger, being a minor, is being cared for by friends.[19] Gosnell has four other children from his two previous marriages.[19] In covering his background, media commentators drew attention to the \"incredibly diverse\" portrayals of Gosnell, touching on both his community works – the creation of a drugs halfway house and teen aid program – contrasted with portrayals of his practice as an abortion mill in which viable fetuses and babies were routinely killed following illegal late-term procedures.[13]\\n\\nMedical practice [ edit ]\\n\\nIn 2011, he was reported to be well known in Philadelphia for providing abortions to poor minority and immigrant women.[20] It was also claimed that Gosnell charged $1,600–$3,000 for each late-term abortion.[21] Gosnell was also associated with clinics in Delaware and Louisiana. Atlantic Women\\'s Services in Wilmington, Delaware, was Gosnell\\'s place of work one day a week. The owner of Atlantic Women\\'s Services, Leroy Brinkley, also owned Delta Clinic of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and facilitated the hiring of staff from there for Gosnell\\'s operation in Philadelphia.[22]\\n\\nLegal case [ edit ]\\n\\nKnown prior complaints [ edit ]\\n\\n1989 and 1993 – cited by Pennsylvania Department of Health for having no nurses in the recovery room.\\n\\n1996 – censured and fined in both Pennsylvania and New York states, for employing unlicensed personnel.\\n\\nAround 1996 – Pediatrician Dr Schwartz – the former head of adolescent services at the Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia and as of 2010 , Philadelphia\\'s health commissioner – testified in the 2010 hearing that around 1996 or 1997, he had hand-delivered a letter of complaint about Gosnell\\'s practice to the Secretary of Health\\'s office and stopped referring patients to the clinic, but received no response.\\n\\n2000 – Civil lawsuit filed on behalf of the children of Semika Shaw, who had called the clinic the day after an abortion to report heavy bleeding, and died 3 days later of a perforated uterus and a bloodstream infection. The case alleged that Gosnell had failed to tell her to return to the clinic or seek emergency medical care. It was settled out of court in 2002 for $900,000. [16] [25]\\n\\nAround 2001 – Gosnell claimed to be providing children\\'s vaccines under a program administered by the Health Department\\'s Division of Disease Control, but was repeatedly suspended for failing to maintain logs and for storing vaccines in unsanitary and inappropriate refrigerators, and at improper temperatures.\\n\\nDecember 2001 – ex-employee Marcella Choung gave what the Grand Jury would later call \"a detailed written complaint\" to the Pennsylvania Department of State, one which she followed up with an interview in March 2002.\\n\\n2006 – Civil lawsuit filed by patient but dismissed as out of time. The complaint was that Gosnell had been unable to complete an abortion, but then apparently failed or refused to call paramedics or other clinical emergency personnel, after the patient had needed help. The patient reported, \"I really felt like he was going to let me die.\"[28]\\n\\nIn total during the course of his career, 46 known lawsuits had been filed against Gosnell over some 32 years.[29] Observers claimed that there was a complete failure by Pennsylvania regulators who had overlooked other repeated concerns brought to their attention, including lack of trained staff, \"barbaric\" conditions, and a high level of illegal late-term abortions.[30]\\n\\n2010 raid [ edit ]\\n\\nThe Women\\'s Medical Society was raided on February 18, 2010, under a search warrant by investigators from the FBI and state police. The raid was the result of a months-long investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Philadelphia Police Department, and the state\\'s Dangerous Drug-Offender Unit into suspected illegal drug prescription use at the practice. The investigation had also revealed the suspicious death of patient Karnamaya Mongar in 2009, which had in turn brought to light further information about unsanitary operations, use of untrained staff, and use of powerful drugs without proper medical supervision and control. Thus, when the February 2010 raid took place, staff from the Pennsylvania Department of State and Pennsylvania Department of Health also attended, as these issues were under their remit:\\n\\nWhen the team members entered the clinic, they were appalled, describing it to the Grand Jury as \\'filthy,\\' \\'deplorable,\\' \\'disgusting,\\' \\'very unsanitary, very outdated, horrendous,\\' and \\'by far, the worst\\' that these experienced investigators had ever encountered. There was blood on the floor. A stench of urine filled the air. A flea-infested cat was wandering through the facility, and there were cat feces on the stairs. Semi-conscious women scheduled for abortions were moaning in the waiting room or the recovery room, where they sat on dirty recliners covered with blood-stained blankets. All the women had been sedated by unlicensed staff – long before Gosnell arrived at the clinic – and staff members could not accurately state what medications or dosages they had administered to the waiting patients. Many of the medications in inventory were past their expiration dates… surgical procedure rooms were filthy and unsanitary… resembling \\'a bad gas station restroom.\\' Instruments were not sterile. Equipment was rusty and outdated. Oxygen equipment was covered with dust, and had not been inspected. The same corroded suction tubing used for abortions was the only tubing available for oral airways if assistance for breathing was needed… [F]etal remains [were] haphazardly stored throughout the clinic– in bags, milk jugs, orange juice cartons, and even in cat-food containers... Gosnell admitted to Detective Wood that at least 10 to 20 percent... were probably older than 24 weeks [the legal limit]... In some instances, surgical incisions had been made at the base of the fetal skulls. The investigators found a row of jars containing just the severed feet of fetuses. In the basement, they discovered medical waste piled high. The intact 19-week fetus delivered by Mrs. Mongar three months earlier was in a freezer. In all, the remains of 45 fetuses were recovered ... at least two of them, and probably three, had been viable.\"\\n\\nGosnell\\'s license to practice was suspended on February 22, 2010,[33] and these and other findings were presented to a grand jury on May 4, 2010. Public discussion focused on claims of unsanitary conditions and other unacceptable conditions at the practices. Media reports stated that furniture and blankets were stained with blood, that freely roaming cats defecated wherever they pleased, and that non-sterilized equipment was used and reused on patients.[34][35][36] According to the grand jury report, patients were given labor-inducing drugs by staff who had no medical training. Once labor began, the patient would be placed on a toilet. After the fetus fell into the toilet, it would be fished out, so as not to clog the plumbing. In the recovery room, patients were seated on dirty recliners covered in blood-stained blankets.[37] Prosecutors alleged that Gosnell had not been certified in either gynecology or obstetrics.[29] The grand jury estimated that Gosnell\\'s practice \"took in $10,000 to $15,000 a night\" additional to income from his exceedingly high level of prescriptions.\\n\\n2011 arrest [ edit ]\\n\\nGosnell was arrested on January 19, 2011, five days after the certification of the grand jury\\'s report. He was charged with eight counts of murder.[39] Prosecutors alleged that he killed seven babies born alive by severing their spinal cords with scissors, and that he was also responsible for the death in 2009 of Karnamaya Mongar, a 41-year-old refugee from Bhutan,[40] who died in his care. Gosnell\\'s wife, Pearl, and eight other suspects were also arrested in connection with the case.[1][40][41] The Drug Enforcement Administration, The Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the Inspector General also sought a 23-count indictment charging Gosnell and seven members of his former staff with drug conspiracy, relating to the practice\\'s illegally prescribing highly-addictive painkillers and sedatives outside the usual course of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose.\\n\\nThe third-degree murder charge relates to Karnamaya Mongar; according to prosecutors, Gosnell\\'s staff gave the 90-pound woman a lethal dose of anesthesia and painkillers. Gosnell\\'s lawyer asserts that Karnamaya Mongar also had in her system other drugs that did not come from Gosnell\\'s clinic, and that none of the infants were born alive. [42] The claim was rejected by the grand jury, based upon expert testimony that \"it was the overdose of Demerol, not some mystery pill, that killed Mrs. Mongar.\"\\n\\nThe claim was rejected by the grand jury, based upon expert testimony that \"it was the overdose of Demerol, not some mystery pill, that killed Mrs. Mongar.\" The seven other murder charges are all of first-degree murder; they relate to babies, whom staff have testified they saw move or cry after complete birth, and whose deaths are alleged to have resulted from subsequent lethal action. They arise because of the \"born alive rule\", a principle of common law which stipulates that by default, for legal purposes, personhood arises – and therefore unlawful killing constituting murder becomes possible – immediately upon the victim\\'s being born alive (several US states as well as Federal legislation have more specific laws to protect fetuses and newborn babies; see fetal rights and born alive laws in the United States). Steven Massof, a clinic employee who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2011, testified that he (Massof) had snipped the spines of more than 100 infants after they had been born alive, and that this was considered \"standard procedure\" at the clinic; a number of other employees had also testified to the same point.[44] No physical evidence exists for five of the seven cases – charges are based on staff testimony and denied by Gosnell. A photograph exists of the sixth, who allegedly had a gestational age of 30 weeks, and the physical remains were obtained of the seventh.[42] The grand jury report states that \"A medical expert with 43 years of experience in performing abortions was appalled. This expert told us, \\'I\\'ve never heard of it [cutting the spinal cord] being done during an abortion\\'.\"\\n\\nThe United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania also alleges that Gosnell\\'s former office staff at Family and Women\\'s Medical Society (WMS) ran a prescription \"pill mill\". From June 2008 through February 18, 2010, Gosnell allegedly engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise by writing and dispensing fraudulent prescriptions for thousands of pills of the frequently abused tablets OxyContin, Percocet, and Xanax, and the frequently abused syrups Phenergan and Promethazine with codeine. Authorities further allege that Gosnell and his staff allowed customers to purchase multiple prescriptions under multiple names. For the first office visit, Gosnell allegedly charged $115, but around December 2009 he allegedly increased the initial office visit fee to $150. Staff at the clinic went from writing several hundred prescriptions for controlled substances per month filled at pharmacies in 2008 to over 2,300 filled at pharmacies in January 2010. Gosnell, with the assistance of his staff, is said to have distributed and dispensed more than 500,000 pills containing oxycodone; more than 400,000 pills containing alprazolam; and more than 19,000 ounces of cough syrup containing codeine.[46]\\n\\nGosnell\\'s lawyer states that \"Everybody\\'s made him the butcher, this, that and the other thing without any trial, without anything being exposed to the public and everybody\\'s found him guilty, that\\'s not right\".[47] He accused the government of a \"lynching\" and stated, \"This is a targeted, elitist and racist prosecution of a doctor who\\'s done nothing but give (back) to the poor and the people of West Philadelphia.\"[42]\\n\\nCases cited in the media [ edit ]\\n\\nExamples of cases cited in the media include:\\n\\nGirl age 15, accompanied by relative (1998): said to have told Gosnell she changed her mind about the abortion once inside the practice. Gosnell allegedly got upset, ripped off the patient\\'s clothing, and forcibly restrained her. The patient later stated that Gosnell told her \"This is the same care that I would give to my own daughter.\" She regained consciousness 12 hours later at her aunt\\'s home, the abortion having been completed against her will. [40] [48]\\n\\nWoman age 28, five months pregnant (2001): Patient described the pain four days after abortion as being so bad she could barely walk. The patient described that upon returning to the clinic because of the pain, ultrasound showed fetal remains left inside her uterus, and that Gosnell suctioned these out without anesthesia. [49] \"I was just laying on the table and crying and I just asked the Lord to get me through it.\" [40]\\n\\n\"I was just laying on the table and crying and I just asked the Lord to get me through it.\" Fifteen-year-old (undated): damages awarded in court upon a finding that Gosnell performed an abortion on a fifteen-year-old without parental permission. [40]\\n\\nKarnamaya Mongar, a 41-year-old refugee from Bhutan (2009): according to prosecutors, Gosnell\\'s staff gave the 90-pound woman a lethal dose of anesthesia and painkillers during a 2009 abortion (this is the adult whose death is charged as third degree murder). During Gosnell\\'s trial, a toxicologist testified to unsafe levels of the drug, and the chair of Anesthesiology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School testified that the dose received by her was \"outrageous\" and \"most\" average adults would have stopped breathing if dosed in the manner described.[ citation needed ] Gosnell\\'s lawyer asserts that Karnamaya Mongar also had other drugs in her system that did not come from Gosnell\\'s clinic, and that none of the infants were born alive.[42]\\n\\nLack of government oversight [ edit ]\\n\\nReports state that state officials had failed to visit or inspect Gosnell\\'s practices since 1993.[41] The grand jury report noted that the medical examiner of Delaware County alerted the Pennsylvania Department of Health that Gosnell had performed an illegal abortion on a 14-year-old who was thirty weeks pregnant;[50] it is also claimed the Pennsylvania Department of Health did not act when they became aware of Gosnell\\'s involvement in the death of Karnamaya Mongar.[50]\\n\\nBrenda Green, executive director of CHOICE, a nonprofit that connects the underinsured and uninsured with health services, told Katha Pollitt of The Nation that \"it tried to report complaints from clients, but the department wouldn\\'t accept them from a third party. Instead, the patients had to fill out a daunting five-page form, available only in English, that required them to reveal their identities upfront and be available to testify in Harrisburg. Even with CHOICE staffers there to help, only two women agreed to fill out the form, and both decided not to submit it. The Department of State and the Philadelphia Public Health Department also had ample warning of dire conditions and took no action.\"[50]\\n\\nIn 2011, it was reported that none of Pennsylvania\\'s 22 abortion clinics had been inspected by the government for more than 15 years.[51] Inspections (other than those triggered by complaints) had ceased under Ridge\\'s governorship, as they were perceived to create a barrier to women seeking abortion services.[52]\\n\\nGrand jury report [ edit ]\\n\\nThe grand jury published its 280-page report in January 2011. It stated that, while some might see the issue and case through the lens of pro- and anti-abortion politics, it was in reality:\\n\\nnot about that controversy; it is about disregard of the law and disdain for the lives and health of mothers and infants. We find common ground in exposing what happened here, and in recommending measures to prevent anything like this from ever happening again.\\n\\nThe grand jury concluded that the practice was a corrupt organization within the meaning of racketeering law, based upon what it considered evidence of deliberate \"standard\" use of \"bogus\" doctors, falsification of records, grossly unprofessional procedures with little or no regard for human life, and flagrant disregard for medical and abortion laws and their consequences. Key findings included:\\n\\nPractice conditions and procedures [ edit ]\\n\\nExtreme unsanitary conditions (resulting in cases of STDs and sepsis); pervasive non-sterile conditions; blood-stained materials and instruments; contamination of the facilities by animal feces, urine, and other noxious fluids and waste; and months-old fetal remains stored in \"jars, bags and jugs\" (in 2013 the trial heard that Gosnell had also been in dispute with his medical waste company, with the latter stopping their services); [55]\\n\\nSurgical malpractice including perforation of bodily organs and \"on at least two occasions\" death;\\n\\nImproper equipment and usage, including repeated reuse (\"over and over\") of disposable supplies, and \"generally broken\" life-saving and monitoring equipment (including blood pressure monitoring, oximeters, and defibrillators);\\n\\nPadlocked emergency access and exit routes;\\n\\nLack of properly trained staff, \"bogus doctors\" — unqualified, unlicensed and unsupervised staff who misrepresented themselves to patients as qualified licensed clinicians — and no qualified nurses. The jury reported that \"Most of Gosnell\\'s employees who worked with patients had little or no remotely relevant training or education\" (ex-employee Marcella Choung, who in 2001 and at interview in 2002 gave a detailed written complaint to the Pennsylvania Department of State, testified that her \\'training\\' for anesthesia consisted of \"a 15-minute description by Gosnell and reading a chart he had posted in a cabinet.\")\\n\\nGosnell himself was largely absent and left the clinic to be operated by his unqualified employees, whom he sometimes \"ordered\" to perform medical actions even if they \"protested\" that they were unqualified. Employees testified they had to rely on themselves, as \"Gosnell disliked it when workers disturbed him by calling for medication advice\";\\n\\nOperation of a \"prescription treadmill\" whereby blank signed prescriptions would be left for those seeking controlled medications, unsupervised and uncontrolled by a practitioner (which was the subject of a parallel and separate Federal investigation);\\n\\nWillful non-compliance with laws intended to safeguard vulnerable women, including non-compliance with requirements for mandatory counseling, consent (for minors), waiting periods (between visiting and surgery);\\n\\nFraudulent temporary employment of a nurse for four days during an NAF inspection, with the aim of deceiving the inspectors into believing that his practice staff included a licensed registered nurse (which it did not); over the few days of their on-site review, the nurse resigned upon realizing the fraud, which also involved Gosnell taking her paycheck back afterwards and paying her in cash instead;\\n\\nFraudulent recording of gestational age and training of staff to manipulate ultrasound in a way that would match the stated number of weeks;\\n\\nDishonest statements by Gosnell and employees to investigators, including claims that Ms. Mongar\\'s death was due to her own action (discredited forensically), falsification and destruction of records, and lying about the manner of her death and Gosnell\\'s (lack of) presence for anesthesia;\\n\\nPatients given labor- and delivery-inducing drugs during the day, then left waiting until late evening for Gosnell to attend or for surgery. Many gave birth during the day as a result, and employees testified \"it was standard procedure for women to deliver fetuses – and viable babies – into toilets\" while waiting for his arrival.\\n\\nPractice staff routinely delivered living babies in the third trimester, subsequently killing them (or ensuring their death). As part of this, fetuses and babies had their demise \"ensured\" post-operatively by severing of the spinal cord with scissors, known by staff as \"snipping\". Most of these were deemed infeasible to prosecute because files and other evidence were not held, although the report stipulates they numbered in the \"hundreds\". Among the \"few cases\" where tangible evidence existed, the jury noted a boy aged 30 weeks at 6 pounds; a frozen body in a water container of \"at least\" 28 weeks; remains of at least one abortion of over 32 weeks for which an extra $1000 had been demanded; testimony of a baby heard to make noise; and a baby left \"moving and breathing for at least 20 minutes\" prior to \"snipping\". The jury heard testimony about \"special\" Sunday sessions, at which only Gosnell and his wife were present, which the jury suspected (and in some cases was able to corroborate) would include cases that were more advanced in time, or more disturbing;\\n\\nOver time, Gosnell and his practice acquired a \"bad reputation\" and during the decade 2000–09, local community organizations ceased referring patients there. To compensate, the practice took on referrals from other in-state cities; it became understood that Gosnell\\'s center would perform abortions \"at any stage, without regard for legal limits\";\\n\\nWhere induced labor failed, Dr Gosnell would attempt to abort surgically, \"often calamitous[ly]\" for the woman involved. Example outcomes included: Woman \"left lying in place for hours after Gosnell tore her cervix and colon\"; relatives called police after entrance refused, remedial colon surgery required. Woman sent home with fetal remains unremoved, \"serious infection\" led to near death. Punctured uterus leading to shock from blood loss and hysterectomy; woman \"held for hours\" by the practice. Patient suffered \"convulsions\" and fell off the operating table, sustaining a head injury; Gosnell \"wouldn\\'t call an ambulance, and wouldn\\'t let the woman\\'s companion leave the building so that he could call an ambulance\". Sedation used to mute sounds of pain; Gosnell specified pre-set amounts of drugs for non-physician staff to use on patients, but without reference to individual needs, and without records or monitoring of condition. On numerous occasions, the same patient was dosed multiple times in quick succession by different employees; Death of Karnamaya Mongar, who received \"repeated unmonitored, unrecorded intravenous injections of Demerol\" (meperidine hydrochloride, an opioid analgesic which the report describes practice staff using as a cheap but dangerous sedative), and ceased breathing. Staff were unable to revive her (emergency medications were not used and the defibrillator was not working), and paramedics were unable to revive her after gaining access, in part because they were deceived by staff as to what had happened and the drugs and dosages responsible.\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernment and third-party handling [ edit ]\\n\\nGosnell\\'s practice was \"caught by accident\" during a raid for illegal drugs prescribing. State officials had been invited to attend the raid as well, since preparations for the drugs raid had revealed prior reports and information suggesting grossly substandard practice conditions at the clinic;\\n\\nPennsylvania Department of Health failed to regulate properly and failed to ensure that the issues noticed were addressed on the few occasions around 1990 that Gosnell was inspected; and ceased inspections \"for political reasons\" (to reduce a perceived deterrent) at the time Tom Ridge took office as Governor of the State;\\n\\nInspections were still to continue if complaints were received, yet repeated complaints did not trigger an investigation; the department\\'s response came after media exposure;\\n\\nThe Department of State\\'s Board of Medicine, which licenses and oversees physicians, had \"more damning information than anyone else\", including a description of the practice by an ex-employee (Choung) a decade previously (2001 and again 2002), as well as knowledge of at least one of the serious incidents cited of surgical malpractice, but took verbal assurances from Gosnell and no other effective or substantial investigative action was taken over these;\\n\\nDepartment of Public Health employees \"regularly\" visited the practice but had not adequately reported the issues present. One inspection confirmed \"numerous violations of protocols for storage and disposal of infectious waste\" but no follow-up occurred;\\n\\nA \"health department representative\" visiting for a vaccination program in 2009 \"discovered that Gosnell was scamming the program\" and \"was able to file detailed reports identifying many of the most egregious elements of Gosnell\\'s practice\". Her attempts to raise concerns were ignored; the grand jury report states \"her reports went into a black hole\";\\n\\nOther third parties had knowledge, but took no visible action. These included the pediatrician and subsequent head of the city\\'s health department, Dr Schwartz, who, around 1996–97, reported concerns about the practice, concerns on which no action was taken, and who did not himself act after being promoted; University of Pennsylvania hospital and Penn Presbyterian Medical Center who treated numerous surgical failures from Gosnell\\'s practice, including a \"flagrantly illegal abortion\", but reported only one of them; the National Abortion Federation whose evaluator around 2009 noted \"records were not properly kept, that risks were not explained, that patients were not monitored, that equipment was not available, that anesthesia was misused\" and concluded \"[i]t was the worst abortion clinic she had ever inspected\", but no report was made of this to any official body;\\n\\nCulpability [ edit ]\\n\\nThe report divided offenses by Gosnell and other practice employees into three categories: \"charges arising from the baby murders and illegal abortions; charges in connection with the death of Karnamaya Mongar; and charges stemming generally from the ongoing operation of a criminal enterprise\". The charges recommended were:\\n\\nGosnell, Williams, Moton, and Massof – charged with first-degree murder for the post-operative killings where evidence existed that the baby was born alive\\n\\nGosnell, Williams, Moton, Massof, and West – charged with conspiracy to commit murder in relation to \"hundreds of unidentifiable instances\" of post-operative killings (called \"snipping\" by staff). The jury also recommended charges of solicitation to commit murder by Gosnell.\\n\\nGosnell and (as co-conspirators) Williams, West, and Gosnell\\'s wife – charged with various violations of the Abortion Control Act, including infanticide and illegal late-term abortions;\\n\\nGosnell, Williams, and West – charged with third-degree murder (Pennsylvania\\'s equivalent to reckless or voluntary manslaughter), drug delivery resulting in death, violations of the Controlled Substances Act and conspiracy in regard to the death of Karnamaya Mongar. The report states: \"Gosnell\\'s contempt for the law and his patients cost Karnamaya Mongar her life. Her death was the direct result of deliberate and dangerous conduct by Gosnell and his staff.\"\\n\\nGosnell, West, and Hampton – charged with hindering apprehension, and lying to the police, medical practitioners, and the grand jury about the circumstances of Mongar\\'s death (Hampton was also charged with perjury in the same matter);\\n\\nGosnell – recommended to be charged with abuse of corpses, in regards to the \"mutilat[ion of] babies and fetuses by cutting off their feet\" and the \"bizarre\" storage of parts of fetal bodies in around 30 jars and other containers at his practice; his explanation that this was done for possible paternity cases was \"rejected out of hand\".\\n\\nThe grand jury also concluded that \"Illegality was so integral to the operation of the Women\\'s Medical Society that the business itself was a corrupt organization\" (18 Pa.C.S. § 911, \"based on a pattern of racketeering activity\"): Gosnell, Williams, West, Moton, Joe, Baldwin, Gosnell\\'s wife, Massof, and O\\'Neill – charged with running that organization or conspiring to do so; Massof and O\\'Neill – charged with theft by deception for pretending to be doctors, and billing for their services as if they were licensed physicians, and (with Gosnell) conspiracy to this effect; Gosnell – charged with obstruction and tampering with evidence, for altering his patient files to hide illegality and for destroying or removing other files entirely; Gosnell and Baldwin – charged with corrupting the morals of a minor, by hiring her 15-year-old daughter as a staff member, who was \"required to work 50-hour weeks, starting after school until past midnight, during which she was exposed to the full horrors of Gosnell\\'s practice\".\\n\\nOf Gosnell himself, the report concluded,\\n\\nWe believe, given the manner in which Gosnell operated, that he killed the vast majority of babies that he aborted after 24 weeks. We cannot, however, recommend murder charges for all of these cases. In order to constitute murder, the act must involve a baby who was born alive. Because files were falsified or removed from the facility and possibly destroyed, we cannot substantiate all of the individual cases in which charges might otherwise have resulted.\\n\\nThe report also examined the failings of official parties, and the key findings, analyzed in two categories:\\n\\nJanice Staloski of the Pennsylvania Department of Health, who personally participated in the 1992 site visit, but decided to let Gosnell slide on the violations that were already evident then. She eventually rose to become director of the division that was supposed to regulate abortion providers, but never looked at Gosnell despite specific complaints from lawyers, a doctor, and a medical examiner. After she was nonetheless promoted, her successor as division director, Cynthia Boyne, failed to order an investigation of the clinic even when Karnamaya Mongar died there. Senior legal counsel Kenneth Brody insisted that the department had no legal obligation to monitor abortion clinics, even though it exercised such a duty until the Ridge administration, and exercised it again as soon as Gosnell became big news. The agency\\'s head lawyer, chief counsel Christine Dutton, defended the department\\'s indifference: \\'People die,\\' she said. Lawyers at the Pennsylvania Department of State behaved in the same fashion. Attorneys Mark Greenwald, Charles Hartwell, David Grubb, Andrew Kramer, William Newport, Juan Ruiz, and Kerry Maloney were confronted with a growing pile of disquieting facts about Gosnell, including a detailed, inside account from a former employee (Marcella Choung, 2001 ), and a 22-year-old dead woman. Every time, though, they managed to dismiss the evidence as immaterial... until the facts hit the fan.\\n\\nRecommendations [ edit ]\\n\\nThe Department of Health should explicitly regulate and annually inspect abortion practices, and examine patient files, licenses, and equipment on-site;\\n\\nSecond-trimester abortions should be performed or supervised by doctors who are board-certified obstetrics and gynecology;\\n\\nThe Department of State \"must repair its review process\", including easier reporting, confidentiality, post-investigation response, with cases automatically checked against past records, malpractice databases, and full past history;\\n\\nReports about individual doctors checked against reports of medical offices where they worked, and vice versa;\\n\\nThe Department of Public Health \"should do at least as much to control infectious medical waste as it does to inspect swimming pools\";\\n\\nThe conclusions finished by examining the extent to which legislation had been inadequate, and the scope for legislative change, concluding that:\\n\\nStatutory changes are necessary as well. Infanticide and third-trimester abortion are serious crimes. The two-year statute of limitations currently applicable for these offenses is inadequate to their severity. The limitations period for late abortion should be extended to five years; infanticide, like homicide, should have none. Impersonating a physician is also a serious, and potentially very dangerous, act. Yet under current law it is not a crime at all. An appropriate criminal provision should be enacted. There may also be other statutory and regulatory revisions that we, as lay people, have not thought to consider. Legislative hearings may be appropriate to further examine these issues.\\n\\nTrial [ edit ]\\n\\nIn 2011, Gosnell, his wife Pearl, and eight other clinic employees were charged in the case.[87] Eight, including Gosnell\\'s wife, subsequently pleaded guilty, most of whom would testify against Gosnell,[88] and three of these pleaded guilty to third-degree murder, carrying a 20- to 40-year term.[88] A gag order was imposed on both defense and prosecution in April 2011, to bar them from talking to the media before the trial.[89] In December 2011 Pearl Gosnell pleaded guilty to performing illegal abortions, conspiracy, criminal conspiracy and corrupt organization;[90] due to spousal privilege, she would not have to testify against Gosnell, although she could still go to prison.[87] She had testified to the grand jury that she alone assisted on Sundays, and that her role was to \"help do the instruments\" in the procedure room and to monitor patients in the recovery room. Another employee testified that she assisted with late-term abortions \"on Sundays or days we were closed [to] do special cases.\"[91]\\n\\nAs a result, the only employee on trial with Gosnell was Eileen O\\'Neill, who allegedly held herself out as a doctor at the clinic when she was not licensed. Her lawyer told jurors she never did so, and performed medical duties only under Gosnell\\'s orders.[42]\\n\\nOn March 18, 2013, opening statements were given in a Philadelphia court. On April 23, after the prosecution had rested its case, the judge dismissed three of the seven first-degree murder charges (the next day the judge reinstated charges related to one and dismissed another, explaining the wrong charge had been mistakenly dismissed[92][93]), the one count of infanticide, and all five charges of abusing a corpse Gosnell had been charged with, as well as six of the nine charges of theft by deception faced by O\\'Neill.[94] No formal ruling has yet been given for these dismissals. Media sources following the trial have suggested that there may have been insufficient evidence of post-procedure life to sustain charges in law. Although prosecutors had argued the movements were voluntary and therefore signs of life,[95][96] it was argued that the evidence offered by prosecutors was equally capable of being interpreted in some or all of these as single autonomous post-mortem motor movements or spasms instead of clinical signs of life, and additionally that none of the seven were capable of being alive as all had been previously killed clinically in utero by means of drugs as part of the procedure.[95][96] Also, although staff had used descriptions such as \"jumping\" and \"screaming\" in their testimony, Gosnell\\'s defense noted that testimony had shown only single movements or breaths, stating that the testimony was not evidence of \"the movements of a live child\", and the medical examiner had also testified that tests could not determine whether or not any of the 47 fetuses found had been born alive due to tissue deterioration.[97][98]\\n\\nThe remaining four first-degree murder charges could still have led to the death penalty. The third-degree murder charges in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, the racketeering charge, and over 200 charges related to multiple violations of abortion law were also left standing.[99][100] Gosnell\\'s defense attorney rested his case summarily without calling or questioning any witnesses, and without Gosnell taking the stand in his defense, leaving the defense case until final arguments (under US law, a defendant may choose not to take the stand; if so then the jury is instructed that no inference or assumption may be drawn from this).[101] O\\'Neill also did not testify in her defense.[92][101] The case went to jury deliberation on April 30, 2013.[102]\\n\\nDefendants, related charges, verdicts and sentencing [ edit ]\\n\\nGosnell was charged with seven counts of first-degree murder (reduced to four counts at trial) and one count of third-degree murder, as well as infanticide (dismissed at trial), five counts of abusing a corpse (all dismissed at trial), multiple counts of conspiracy, criminal solicitation and violation of a state law that forbids abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy.[94][100][103] The non-murder charges included 24 counts of violating Pennsylvania\\'s Abortion Act by performing illegal third-trimester abortions, 227 counts of violating a 24-hour waiting-period requirement, failing to counsel patients, and racketeering.[100] His co-defendants were:\\n\\nPearl Gosnell, Kermit\\'s wife, was charged with abortion at 24 or more weeks, conspiracy and participating in a corrupt organization. She pleaded guilty to these charges on December 13, 2011. [104] [105] Pearl Gosnell was sentenced to 7 to 23 months in prison. [106]\\n\\nPearl Gosnell was sentenced to 7 to 23 months in prison. Steven Massof and Eileen O\\'Neill, both medical school graduates without proper licensing to be doctors in Pennsylvania. Gosnell presented these employees as physicians and billed insurance companies more on this allegation. All three are charged with theft by deception for these acts. [107]\\n\\nSteven Massof, a medical school graduate who lacked a license, pleaded guilty in November 2011 to two counts of third-degree murder for the deaths of two babies who had been born alive. [108]\\n\\nKareema Cross, who testified at the state trial she had seen at least ten babies breathe after being aborted who were then killed, pleaded guilty to federal drug charges over improper distribution of pain medicine from Gosnell\\'s clinic.[109]\\n\\nOn May 13, 2013, the jury reported that they were deadlocked on two counts.[110] After returning to deliberations, the jury convicted Gosnell of three counts of murder, one count of involuntary manslaughter, and many lesser counts. He was found not guilty on one of the counts of murder.[111][112]\\n\\nOn May 14, 2013, Gosnell struck a deal with prosecutors in which he agreed to waive all his appeal rights regarding his conviction on the day earlier. In exchange, prosecutors allowed Gosnell to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[113]\\n\\nOn May 15, 2013, Gosnell was sentenced to three life terms.[114]\\n\\nImpact and aftermath [ edit ]\\n\\nOther bodies and persons claiming to have made reports [ edit ]\\n\\nIn April 2011 the University of Pennsylvania Health System claimed as early as 1999 that they had provided to authorities reports about botched procedures by Gosnell. The only case for which any reports were produced was that of Semika Shaw, a 22-year-old, who died at the University of Pennsylvania hospital as a result of bleeding and sepsis caused by a botched procedure by Gosnell. Gosnell\\'s insurers settled a lawsuit with family members of Shaw for $900,000. The health system also claims other undocumented reports were made orally, for which they did not have records.[115]\\n\\nRegulatory and legislative impact [ edit ]\\n\\nThe Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure Committee of the Pennsylvania State Senate, led by Robert M. Tomlinson, began a hearing in February 2011 to look into the failure of the Pennsylvania Department of State — which is responsible for licensing doctors — to provide any oversight of Gosnell\\'s activities. At the same time, the Public Health and Welfare Committee of the state Senate, chaired by Pat Vance, conducted hearings on the Pennsylvania State Health Department\\'s failure to put a stop to Gosnell\\'s activities.[116]\\n\\nIn part as a result of the grand jury report on Gosnell, in late 2011, Pennsylvania passed a law, SB 732, that places abortion clinics under the same health and safety regulations as other outpatient surgical centers. Among those who supported the bill was Democrat Margo L. Davidson, whose cousin Semika Shaw died as a result of procedures done by Gosnell.[117][118] Davidson specifically linked her support for the additional regulations to her cousin\\'s death, which she attributed to poor medical practices.[119]\\n\\nIn May 2013, as a result of the Kermit Gosnell case, Representative Joe Pitts (R-Pennsylvania), chair of the health-matters subcommittee of the United States House of Representatives\\' Energy and Commerce Committee, began an inquiry into states\\' oversight of abortion clinics.[120]\\n\\nIn June 2013, the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Speaker of the House John Boehner said the bill was in response to Gosnell\\'s convictions. The legislation was viewed as mostly symbolic, as it stood little chance of being approved by the Democratic-led U.S. Senate.[121][122][123]\\n\\nNon-legislative actions resulting from the case [ edit ]\\n\\nIn February 2011 Pennsylvania Governor and former State Attorney General Tom Corbett fired six employees and commenced action to fire eight others where for legal or contractual reasons, more extensive dismissal procedures were required. These included Basil Merenda, the acting head of the Pennsylvania Department of State, Christine Dutton, the Department of Health\\'s chief counsel (who, in reaction to being questioned why the Department did not react to a death at Gosnell\\'s clinic, said \"people die\"), and Stacy Mitchell, a deputy secretary in the health department (whom the grand jury cited as a key figure in the Health Department\\'s indifference to, and non-regulation of, abortion clinics). Some of the people most connected by the grand jury report with the failure of the government to act, such as Janice Staloski, had retired by this point and so no action was taken against them.[124]\\n\\nCivil cases [ edit ]\\n\\nThe family of Karnamaya Mongar brought a wrongful death suit against Gosnell and sought to freeze his assets to prevent him from transferring them to other people to avoid paying.[125][126] In September 2015, a judge in Philadelphia Common Pleas court awarded nearly $4 million in compensatory damages to Mongar\\'s daughter, Yashoda Devi Gurung. However, reports that Gosnell had few assets by this time made it doubtful whether any of the money would be paid.[127]\\n\\nMedia coverage and public reactions [ edit ]\\n\\nGosnell\\'s arrest has been the subject of much public comment[128] and expressions of condemnation and shock by senior public figures of all parties. Mayor Michael Nutter (D-PA) said, \"I think it\\'s quite clear that, if these allegations are true, we\\'ve had a monster living in our midst\" while vowing to watch the city\\'s remaining abortion clinics more closely.[129] Outgoing Governor Ed Rendell (D-PA) criticized Department of Health officials saying, \"I was flabbergasted to learn that the Department of Health did not think their authority to protect public health extended to clinics offering abortion services\",[130] while incoming Governor Tom Corbett (R-PA) stated through a spokesperson that he was \"appalled at the inaction on the part of the Health Department and the Department of State,\"[131] and District Attorney of the city of Philadelphia R. Seth Williams said \"My comprehension of the English language can\\'t adequately describe the barbaric nature of Dr. Gosnell... Pennsylvania is not a third-world country... There were several oversight agencies that stumbled upon and should have shut down Kermit Gosnell long ago.\"[132]\\n\\nGosnell also practiced in other states, including Delaware. In January 2011, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden (D-Delaware) promised a wide-ranging investigations into the abortions Gosnell performed in Delaware saying; \"I\\'m disturbed by the allegations that were handed up by the grand jury in Philadelphia\".[133]\\n\\nA spokesperson for the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers, noted that Gosnell had been rejected for membership following inspection, because his clinics did not meet appropriate standards of care, but that \"they\\'d cleaned the place up and hired an RN [registered nurse] for our visit. We only saw first-trimester procedures.\"[50] She adding that \"Unfortunately, some women don\\'t know where to turn. You sometimes have substandard providers preying on low-income women who don\\'t know that they do have other (safe) options.\"[134] A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood in Southeastern Pennsylvania, condemned Gosnell, saying, \"We would condemn any physician who does not follow the law or endangers anyone\\'s health... All women should have access to high-quality care when they are vulnerable and facing difficult decisions.\"[135] Dayle Steinberg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, says she knew that Gosnell had provided abortions in Philadelphia for many years, but says she hadn\\'t heard of any problems at his clinic until the allegations surfaced.[136] She has been quoted as stating that \"when Gosnell was in practice, women would sometimes come to Planned Parenthood for services after first visiting Gosnell\\'s West Philadelphia clinic, and would complain to staff about the conditions there. We would always encourage them to report it to the Department of Health.\"[137] She clarified that \"when Gosnell was arrested, I asked our staff if anyone had ever heard of him, and clinic staff members reported that a few women over the years said they were concerned about the uncleanliness of his facility and came to Planned Parenthood instead... if we had heard anything remotely like the conditions that have since come to light about Gosnell\\'s facility, of course we would have alerted the state and other authorities\".[138]\\n\\nKermit Gosnell himself gave an interview to Fox 29 in February 2011,[48] in which he stated that:\\n\\n\"I expect to be vindicated.\"\\n\\n[Regarding the allegations] \"to tell you the truth, I hope to read them in 3 to 6 months [...] because I have lived through negative publicity before.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s something I have personally experienced several times before where my surgical abilities have been challenged, where the choices that I have made have not always been perfect.\"\\n\\n\"If you are not making mistakes, you are not really attempting to do something, so I think that my patients are aware that I do my very best by them.\"\\n\\n\"The standard that I share with everyone that, I frequently say is that I provide the same care that I would provide my own daughter I feel.\"\\n\\n\"I have a story to tell. [...] my work to the community is of value.\"\\n\\nGosnell reported that he received outpouring of support: \"letters, I have gotten wonderful little messages of support, and confidence that I am a good person will prevail.\"\\n\\nCriticism of media coverage [ edit ]\\n\\nA perception had built up among some journalists and pro-life groups that there had been a reluctance to report on the trial among mainstream media. In an April 11, 2013 opinion column for USA Today, Kirsten Powers wrote: \"A Lexis-Nexis search shows none of the news shows on the three major national television networks has mentioned the Gosnell trial in the last three months\", and that national press coverage was represented by a Wall Street Journal columnist who \"hijacked\" a segment on Meet the Press, a single page A-17 story on the first day of the trial by The New York Times, and no original coverage by The Washington Post.[139]\\n\\nWhile Kirsten Powers is credited by some for drawing media coverage to the Gosnell trial, Dave Weigel at Slate.com reported it was conservatives\\' aggressive use of social media, especially Twitter, that \"goaded\" the press into covering the trial in Philadelphia. According to Weigel, Troy Newman, president of the Kansas-based pro-life Operation Rescue, had organized a Twitter campaign using \"#Gosnell\" to break the \"Gosnell Media Blackout.\" Key to that social media campaign was a picture of rows of empty media seats in the Gosnell courtroom taken by Calkins Media columnist J.D. Mullane.[140]\\n\\nMullane told Weigel he was struck by the absence of media at the trial, and took out his iPhone and snapped the picture, tweeting it later that night.\\n\\n\"Mullane retweeted the photo a few more times, with different captions, because it had been packed into a snowball (of criticism)\" which included Powers\\' column for USA Today, Weigel wrote. The empty seats photograph was used by pro-life activists to show \"proof\" of media dereliction. Weigel wrote: \"It worked. An estimated 106,000 #Gosnell tweets later, on April 15, Mullane reported that major networks and newspapers had sent their reporters to cover the trial—Fox News, the New York Times, the Washington Post.\"\\n\\nWriting for The Washington Post, Melinda Henneberger responded that \"we didn\\'t write more because the only abortion story most outlets ever cover in the news pages is every single threat or perceived threat to abortion rights. In fact, that is so fixed a view of what constitutes coverage of that issue that it\\'s genuinely hard, I think, for many journalists to see a story outside that paradigm as news. That\\'s not so much a conscious decision as a reflex, but the effect is one-sided coverage\". Explaining why some of her colleagues did not report on the story, Henneberger wrote, \"One colleague viewed Gosnell\\'s alleged atrocities as a local crime story, though I can\\'t think of another mass murder, with hundreds of victims, that we ever saw that way. Another said it was just too lurid, though that didn\\'t keep us from covering Jeffrey Dahmer, or that aspiring cannibal at the NYPD.\"[141] Writing for Bloomberg View, Jeffrey Goldberg said that this story \"upsets a particular narrative about the reality of certain types of abortion, and that reality isn\\'t something some pro-choice absolutists want to discuss\".[142]\\n\\nThe Los Angeles Times,[143] The Atlantic,[144] Slate,[145] and Time[146] all published opinion columns where the writer thought the incident was not getting as much media coverage as it deserved.

       " 'Right wing and fascist groups converged once again on Austin on November 4th. Five months ago we released an article which explained an ongoing desperation from the right:\\n\\n“The far right relies on having a common enemy to unite around since there can be no unity among their varying programs and agendas. Every public action they take demonstrates this fact and shows off their own instability. They hoped to find this common enemy in the form of ‘antifa’… Fascist organizers are so desperate to conjure this enemy that they resort in many instances to false flag events and phony “antifa” pages that promise the bullheaded participants an enemy to confront. This tactic seldom pays off.”\\n\\nThis time however their fabrication relied on sensationalized and totally made up threats of a “civil war”. The right completely made up a civil war/insurrection, then had the nerve to taunt antifascists for not showing up to the civil war that they made up. In many ways this is nonsensical and would seem counterproductive—the only utility being a flagrant act of desperation to unite their disparate forces. To this end they had some minor success. How many times though can the same snake oil salesmen hock the promised show down with “antifa”, having people drive out only to find a small group of liberals? No red flags, no communists, no masks, and no street fights with the right—all dressed up with nowhere to go…\\n\\nIt is no secret that the fascists and their collaborators who were behind propagating a phony threat of civil war were well aware of the lies they were telling to their sympathizers and supporters. Fascist rag InfoWars follows our blog, they even made an entire video news report covering one of its posts. They would no doubt have noticed that we made no mention of November 4th, that we had no plans for that day, and that there would be no massive antifascist action in Austin that day without us at least promoting it. So what were these vultures on about? Well a small group of mostly out-of-towners by the name of Refuse Fascism had a planned march—billed clearly around a platform of non-violence. If you came out to confront “antifa” you should really get it through your head, you were lied to. The truth is not in stock over at InfoWars and similar outlets. They lied about this, you were tricked. What else have they lied to you about? Perhaps the truth is they have lied to you on the basic question of who your friends and enemies are. Your enemies (unless you are a fascist) are not antifa, your enemies are not communists or anarchists, but the very system of corporate capitalist leeches that these right wing pundits have a financial and social interest in defending. If this is not enough to wake you up then ask yourself who is really the rube, who got played?\\n\\nThis non-event in Austin was not worth our attendance, not worth even tacit endorsement. We had better things to do. Not going to events your enemies have fabricated is not a sign of weakness it’s simply not taking the bait. We have no interest in marching around the capitol along a controlled route with a pack of out-of-towners committed to non-violence and we certainly have no interest in a showdown with some people who were so gullible they could be tricked into thinking a civil war was imminent on November 4th 2017. We hope this experience has been educational for all and intend to lay out what we have learned.\\n\\nRefuse Fascism does not speak for the revolutionary or antifascist left in Austin. They do not claim to, they only claim to oppose fascism in what we discern to be the tritest and most limited fashion. While we applaud them for going on with their march in the face of being outnumbered by many armed reactionaries, we are concerned with both their objectives as well as their methods. Going through with the march showed some courage and we welcome courage into our city and even consider it to a positive thing. This is all compromised beyond repair however by the leisurely way they approach the question of fascism.\\n\\nIt is no secret that Refuse Fascism is an initiative of the revisionist organization which uses the name Revolutionary Communist Party USA. While the level of condemnation and enmity we feel towards this party of traitors and rats could take up an entire book we must not concern ourselves with this right here and instead focus mainly on the errors Refuse Fascism has inherited from its poisonous parent. So let’s look at the dual aspect. Refuse Fascism has earned the attention of the right due largely to their sustained propaganda campaign which has been going on since at least December in response to the current presidential administration. Like the revisionist party which initiated it, Refuse Fascism sits squarely and ideologically in the legalist reformist camp, like every other revisionist organization in the US today. The revisionist RCP fames itself for having produced a coherent critique of all communist struggles hitherto, their conclusion being to rupture from those fine traditions and accepting a corny “New Synthesis of Communism” which was innate in the mind of their leader. This idea just like many other revisionist ideas relies on waiting, waiting, and waiting without any preparation for war. It’s ironic that such a group could propel the insecurities of the right into such a state of panic and goes to show how little they investigate these matters and how fragile their fears are. The right really are paper tigers if an outfit like Refuse Fascism could provoke such a frenzied response.\\n\\nRefuse Fascism has shown a consistent propaganda effort, some clever stunts, and fair amount of guts in carrying through with their limited and uninspired plans. On the other hand and what we consider to the main aspect, their emphasis on waiting and engaging by strictly legal means has them disarmed in the political sense as well as the practical sense. They have not got the sense to take fascism seriously. They have forgotten history. They have no sense of the danger posed by fascism in the here and now, so they do not seriously try to protect themselves from it. They have in the past been reckless enough with their membership lists and petitions that many innocent people have been doxxed on Neo-Nazi websites. In an age where a common fascist tactic is to report people to ICE for deportation we find this error to be worthy of condemning the whole project as worse than a liability. Politically, Refuse Fascism offers no real break from old worn out liberalism, their demands are the most meaningless gestures. Demands and actions that include going to bat for former FBI director James Comey. A supposedly communist initiative trying to reinstate any pig should be enough to give one pause if not cause serious revulsion. Their other pathetic and conservative demands don’t put them too far to the left of the Democratic Party with the call to “impeach Trump”, as if Trump were the cause of modern fascism and not the result of its growth in mainstream society. This limited bourgeois worldview that equates Trump entirely with fascism misses the point of how and why fascism emerges in declining imperialist centers. Their grand vision for antifascism begins and ends with presidential impeachment. This has left them with a combined lack of vision as well as a delusion of grandeur. They have no accurate assessment of the objective concrete conditions of increasing fascist populism springing from a deindustrialized and declining USA, nor do they have an accurate read on their own subjective capacity to confront these conditions. They are lost. This is what inevitably results from the abandonment of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. In short we do not trust them with even the knowledge of our faces let alone leading any kind of antifascist struggles. They might draw in and burn out a few new people with their plans to throw Trump out, which equate to nothing more than regurgitated Occupy Wall Street tactics, tactics which should be cast aside by all.\\n\\nWe must reiterate the line we put forward five months ago once more:\\n\\n“We call on all those who struggle in the state of Texas to get organized, to cast aside illusions of a leaderless resistance—a pipe dream of an Occupy Wall Street type of antifascism—in favor of a genuine, mass-based antifascist resistance organized along militant lines.”\\n\\nWhat we have referred to as “Occupy Wall Street type of antifascism” was even more evident in other minute fractions of the so-called left this November 4th. Local anarchists operating under the redundant title of “Independent Antifa” (redundant because worldwide “antifa” is already decentralized) managed to accomplish even less that the liberal moderates at Refuse Fascism. No they did not join in the yelling match downtown or even claim they are going to get the president impeached, their “resistance” amounted to nothing more than going to a fairly sleepy spot on the edge of town and draping a bed sheet over a small confederate monument. They did this “symbolic action” to “spread fear and confusion” among the right… Such ineffectual activity is not just sad and pathetic, it is absolutely useless and detrimental in the way that it uses “diversity of tactics” to do absolutely nothing and claim you are doing something to confront fascism. We are in support of the many actions across the US which have attacked, vandalized or destroyed confederate monuments. We have seen this effectively remove these racist symbols and win many over to causes of antifascism. What we have never seen accomplish anything is draping bedsheets over them. This only bears mention because those behind this posturing have made self-righteous statements about what amounts to nothing. These types of inaction need to be critically assessed and moved away from. Five months ago, similar liberal anarchists chose to have an unmasked and unarmed picnic in the same space where fascists gathered to march, with security practice even more shameful than Refuse Fascism who at least had the nerve to stand up. There is no excuse for such needless exposure to fascists and in no way are they confronted by bedsheets, picnics, or other “symbolic resistance”. Liberalism is nothing but left cover for fascism as it offers up phony ways to get involved which will never decrease the fascist ability to organize. Fascism grows up all around it then confronts it and kills it. This type of liberalism is already rotting in the grave and you should abandon it if you have been introduced to its watered down excuse for antifascism. While there is a need to support efforts which may fall short, in the context of each contributing what they are able we cannot sit and pat ourselves on the back or posture behind toothless “symbolic resistance”.\\n\\nSo what were we doing November 4th? We adhere to our line of community self-defense. This means we stood with a diverse group of antifascists who were committed to defending at risk communities most threatened by the fascists who shuttled in from the surrounding areas. We do this modest work in private and do not feel the need to give exact details here. All over Austin there are people and spaces which these scum would love to target. We listen to the masses of people and go where we are most needed. If these fascists plan to make their genocidal dreams a reality by taking out their frustration from finding no “antifa” on innocent community members they can expect to find real anti-fascists there who are not interested in non-violence, bedsheets or token “symbolic resistance”. They can expect and count on us defending these communities with our very lives and providing the best defense we are capable of. We do not let the enemy choose the battle ground and we do not confront the enemy when they have a greater force. By sticking to these basic principles we can and will win. We continue to accumulate forces, serve the working class of Austin and sharpen our line. When we fight, we fight to win, to crush the enemy and humiliate them. This is how we conduct the mass line and this is how we root ourselves among the very people who are the makers of history.\\n\\nWe see little cause to continuously rally around the reactionary capitol of the reactionary state of Texas. We hold firm to the fact that antifascists need to place themselves in working class neighborhoods of Austin, to do protracted mass work among the people of these neighborhoods. Antifascism is not spectacle, it’s not performance art for middle class anarchists nor is it just an opportunity for dead revisionists to continue hocking their reformist nonsense in order to repopulate their shrinking ranks. Antifascism must become operable in the daily lives of the working class masses and especially in the oppressed nations held captive by the prison house of the USA.\\n\\nWhile we are harsh and critical with these revisionists and idealists, we understand that we do share a common enemy at times and we hope that as things develop we find ourselves side by side in the struggle on the streets against fascism. This potential and circumstantial tactical unity is temporary too and we issue this statement as a plea to those who wish to fight fascism to avoid their dead end trajectory and do the hard work that victory demands.\\n\\nAfter the downtown protests around 3pm, fascists of Patriot Front (a rebranding of the group Vanguard America who was responsible for the murder of Heather Heyer as well as the attempted murders carried out by Texas members after a Florida Richard Spencer Speech) decided to go hold a protest outside of MonkeyWrench Books where they were reported to have chanted the Nazi slogan “blood and soil” in the affluent Hyde Park neighborhood. No confrontation or defense of the space was made by the anarchists who run the bookstore and the fascists eventually left on their own accord. We are saddened that anarchists have failed to defend this space on the grounds that it emboldens the fascists to keep trying this type of confrontation.\\n\\nIn Austin some real resistance did take place, and it was not the initiative of any left-wing group but that of organic mass action. We celebrate this. Late last night after not finding much action in the streets a group of fascists decided to attend a local bar—as usual they were obnoxious, offensive and riding a false high. They wore their colors brazenly and walked into the wrong bar in the wrong town and 8 of them were physically confronted and ejected by patrons with no help from the staff or hired security who refused to take any action. The masses once again mustered more guts and resistance than the activist-left. We should always make every door closed to them and encourage this type of mass action.\\n\\nThere is nothing as gruesome as what the fascists have planned for you, organized serious resistance to them is past due. If you are an antifascist of any wide variety then make it your purpose to amass greater forces so that these days of fascist road trips into Austin become just a memory. Real antifascism means revolution, it means going beyond reactive confrontation into pro-active removal of fascists from all places and all walks of life. We must end fascism because it has every intention of ending us.\\n\\nThere was no civil war but lets make the fascists worst nightmares a reality by continuing to build the antifascist movement along revolutionary lines!\\n\\n-Red Guards Austin, November 5th 2017',\n",
       " 'Did a German secret society resort to human sacrifice to stem the tide of the First World War in Germany’s favour? Was the builder of a house that became known as The Round House a member of this order? Were human remains found, and were the outlines of a giant Wodan, the supreme god of Nordic mythology, carefully hidden in the landscape around this enigmatic edifice? Was the area surrounding the house witness to bizarre rituals? A shadowy group of investigators claims so.\\n\\nRead Part 1.\\n\\nAround the 1900’s, the exact date or year is shrouded in uncertainty, wealthy estate owner Frank Van Vloten suddenly starts with a series of extensive landscape and garden projects on his estate. The labourers who work for him do not understand why, as almost everything they are ordered to do to makes no sense from an agricultural point of view. On the surface, there seems to be no logical plan behind the work. ‘But there was work, and therefore food on the table’, is the consensus among the labourers.\\n\\nThe working group investigating the mysteries that swirl around the house is set on the trail of looking at the landscape surrounding the Round House instead of delving through what archives remain, by a chance discovery. They find what they see as a clue in the files of a former SS affiliated archaeologist. Before World War II, the archaeologist had done some excavation work at the Mythstee. This is a spot in the vicinity of the Round House, since long rumoured to have been an ancient Germanic place of worship.\\n\\nThe former SS affiliated archaeologist, Frans Christiaan Bursch (1903-1981), seen above in the comfort of his study in the 1930’s, has a chequered past, to say the least. During the Second World War, from 1940 to 1945, Bursch became a member of the N.S.B., a Dutch pro-Nazi organisation. 1943 finds him at the Ukraine, involved in excavations with the use of slave labour. Notwithstanding his N.S.B. membership and his affiliation to Heinrich Himmler’s occult research institute Ahnenerbe, he escapes any consequences after the end of the war in 1945. Until his death in 1981, he is a teacher in classical languages. Bursch, as might be expected from someone who had the dark overlord as his master, saw ancient German ruins and remains everywhere. In how far Bursch was working on a theory involving a giant pictogram and a geoglyph in the vicinity of the Mythstee, is hard to say. His remaining archive offers no further clue, and his post-war book makes no mention of it.\\n\\nThe Mythstee, another source points out, is a place of evil. He recounts vague rumours that ghosts and other strange creatures were frequently seen there. “Dark and bloody rituals said to have been conducted at the Mythstee and for a long time there were those that claimed that the famous Varus Battle took place there, and not somewhere in Germany. Wild German hordes whipped into frenzy by their druids sacrificed the vanquished Romans on the earthen walls of the Mythstee. This was the cause that the Pan-Germanic movement had a more than usual interest in that particular spot, as it was also placed on a ‘Heilige Lijn’, the German equivalent of a ley-line. This line allegedly was restored in 1891 by the Alldeutscher Verein. That was the motive for the construction of the Round House and its inhabitant, Frank van Vloten, was placed there under orders of the Pangermanic movement.” Modern archaeology though has established that the Mythstee is a curious, but natural formation.\\n\\nWhat the working group finds in the files of the deceased archaeologist on the Mythstee is a depiction of the Giant of Cerne Abbas. Wondering about the presence of this seemingly unrelated image in that file, the question arises: would it be possible that the landscape surrounding The Round House might have hidden a similar figure?\\n\\nIn the light of this theory, the extensive work done on the estate begins to make sense. The landscaping, the planting or removing or relocation of bushes, the digging of certain ditches and paths and the creation of artificial hills all serve to create, in deepest secret, a giant figure of Wodan, only to be seen from the sky, with the Round House in its centre. For that is Wodan’s remaining eye.\\n\\nSchalkwijk , the spokesman for the anonymous group investigating this mysterious house, claims that he and his group investigated the surrounding area with the use of soil investigations, measuring equipment and ‘other sources’. They arrive at the conclusion that The Round House and the estate were constructed according to ‘German rites’. Seen from above, the giant image of the Nordic god Wodan would be visible. The Round House is his one remaining eye. Schalkwijk even manages to reconstruct a helmet and a spear in the landscape. In a bush he recognizes a beard and moustache. They further claim to have found at the south a ditch in the form of a phallus, with a vulva nearby, at walking distance. “We got the most insane orders, replacing hills, dig away soil and construct rice fields. We never saw rice”, the labourers tell. These statements strengthen Schalkwijk and his group in their conviction.\\n\\nFrom other quarters too, it is murmured that the place has a reputation for weirdness. Some visitors will later claim that they felt haunted by a strange, oppressive atmosphere when visiting the by now wooded area. Other tales recount how many times, in the past but also in the present, little people were seen who allegedly had an abode in the vicinity of the Mythstee. But that is not everything. A wealthy family buys an estate adjacent to The Round House and the Mythstee in the 1930’s. Some of its members behave very curiously and subsequently more rumours start that a ‘Germanic-Celtic cult’ practice its rituals at the Round House. When National Socialism emerges, eugenic experiments were conducted there as well. Mention is made of unholy orgies with certain very high placed German-friendly Dutchmen. There’s even mention of the ghostly appearances of four or five girls. They can be seen wandering over the nearby path sometimes at night, their arms tightly clutched.\\n\\nThe problem though is that the existence of a huge geoglyph in the form of Wodan remains unproven too. On the aerial photos that have been studied by enthousiasts and researchers of the myth, nothing is seen. Also, but a few traces remain of the original landscape projects of Frank Van Vloten, seen above in a family picture in the upper right corner. Are Schalkwijk and his group of fellow researchers deluded and do they simply want to see things that are not there at all? What certainly doesn’t give one confidence is that almost anything in the book on the case is unsourced. We don’t know who spoke to whom, when or how.\\n\\nBut the strange stories remain.\\n\\nIn regards to these weird tales about little men and unholy rites by a ‘German-Celtic cult’, these stem from an odd source as well. They appear in some curious leaves with intricate drawings, done by an elderly and deceased man by thename of Eldermans. Not much is known about him, what remained of his archive when Eldermans destroyed most of it towards the end of his life, is for the most part found in a museum for witchcraft. Eldermans himself is described by his late son-in-law with simply one word: ‘witch’.\\n\\nPerhaps a closer examination of the purported shadowy group responsible for the occult activity during World War One might shed some much-needed light on the matter. It is perhaps here, in the various allegations of occult orders working on behalf of Imperial Germany, that we may be able to shed some light on the matter.\\n\\nRead Part III: The Secret Brotherhood',\n",
       " \"No matter how cool your interface is, it would be better if there were less of it.\\n\\n— Alan Cooper, father of visual basic\\n\\nManaging a public project is not an easy task. Chances are you might incur in common pitfalls that will get you stuck along the way. Whenever progress starts to slow down, maintainers tend to give up and move on to other things. This might happen whenever developers make decisions about their designs that can lead to overly complicated APIs or buggy libraries. Besides that, there are many other aspects maintainers need to carefully take into account that are usually overlooked. Some challenges poised include creating a healthy community around the project, moderating third party changes, keeping a coherent versioning system or managing a public repository, just to name a few.\\n\\nCreating a new library\\n\\nIt all starts whenever you spot a recurring problem in the code at hand that we have already solved a couple times. As engineers, we are compelled to create a generic solution to avoid the need to rewrite the same algorithms over and over again. Going one step forward, such identified area of improvement might not be unique to you and other engineers might be struggling, if not with the exact same issue, at least with very similar ones. In this scenario, public coding comes to save the day. It will not only solve your problem but also will give other developers insight on how similar issues can be faced. Additionally, by sharing your code, you will unlock a world of possibilities to learn new techniques, idioms, patterns and more.\\n\\nIf you are decided to kick-start a new library, first step is to clearly define what your problem is. Pro-tip: Try to conceptually framework the issue under consideration. Imagine that your library has been already published by one of the best developers you know and you are just using it. What would you expect from it? Would it be fast? Would it be small? Or maybe it would be highly flexible? Prioritize those characteristics and stick to them while developing your library development. This exercise will help you make the right design choices whenever there are multiple options to tackle a given problem (adding a new feature might decrease efficiency or make the library significantly more complicated than originally designed).\\n\\nOn top of everything, you should always aim to follow one single rule:\\n\\nSimple things must be easy to build, complex things might be hard to use\\n\\nAdding unneeded complexity to your library or API can ruin your project since it will be harder to use and develop. At some point, even yourself might not be able to find the time to maintain and support your own code.\\n\\nTo wrap things up:\\n\\nPrioritize your library goals from the beginning.\\n\\nAim to code the most basic implementation, ie. the one that solves your problem (and only your problem).\\n\\nKeep your abstractions down to the minimum.\\n\\nCase of study\\n\\nImagine that we want to create a new Java library to drive RC cars homogeneously from your mobile device. For the sake of usability, the objective is to come with an interface to make it really easy to interact with cars of any model, brand, and year. Our main goals are:\\n\\nThe API should be as easy to use as possible.\\n\\nThe interface should feature only a few possible actions but they should be flexible.\\n\\nIt is important to keep in mind that these characteristics are just an example. Every developer should pick the ones he or she would like to see in their projects. At this point, there is no wrong answer when wondering what are the goals of your library.\\n\\nOnce our priorities are well defined, we can create our first version of our public API:\\n\\nCARumi v0.0.1\\n\\n/** * Methods invoked on the instance will operate directly on the physical * car immediately */ public class CARumi { /** * Creates an instance of a CARumi associated to a specific RC car. */ public CARumi(String name) {/*...*/} /** * Accelerates the car in the specified amount expressed as m/s */ public void throttle(int amount) {/*...*/} /** * Slows down the car in the specified amount expressed as m/s */ public void brake(int amount) {/*...*/} /** * Turns the car to the left. The rotation angle is expressed in radians */ public void turnLeft(int angle) {/*...*/} /** * Turns the car to the right. The rotation angle is expressed in radians */ public void turnRight(int angle) {/*...*/} }\\n\\nThis represents the initial interface that we will be iterating in the following sections. Every method incorporates a little comment documenting what that method does. If you have reached this point and think our API can be somehow improved let's jump to the next point.\\n\\nOne good name is worth a thousand lines of code\\n\\nOne of the most remarkable issues that open source developers face is the fact of developers not reading the provided documentation. I believe we should not entirely blame them. Sometimes reading documentation can be really boring. It requires a lot of time and concentration. We are not going to show you how to write good documentation. Instead we'll make sure that your lazy users to do not need it at all.\\n\\nOur CARumi API has an ambiguity problem. We force our users to do an extra effort to use our library since a lot of the information required to use correctly CARumi is only found within the comments.\\n\\nWe can not hope that all our users will happily spend time reading the entire documentation and then use the library. Some will be eager to play around with the code directly. We can make their lives easier if we make our API as self-documented as possible. Here's how:\\n\\nCARumi v0.0.5\\n\\npublic class CARumi { public CARumi(String carModel) {/*...*/} public void throttle(int metersPerSecond) {/*...*/} public void brake(int metersPerSecond) {/*...*/} public void turnLeft(int angleInRadians) {/*...*/} public void turnRight(int angleInRadians) {/*...*/} }\\n\\nI have removed all the comments for two reasons, the first one is to make it easier to read. The second reason is to show you how those users read your API. As you can see we have replaced the name of the parameters to give them a more meaningful name. With this simple step, we have removed a lot of the ambiguity in our code, we now have some of our library prerequisites written directly into the code!\\n\\nThere are still some other problems that we should take into consideration so let's jump directly into the next section.\\n\\nWatch your visibility\\n\\nIt is really important that our library only exposes what we want it to expose. While implementing each of the features of our library we must always be aware of the visibility of our classes, methods, and attributes. Using an object-oriented programming language like Java, we should also take care of inheritance.\\n\\nHere is an example of some of the inner details of our class:\\n\\npublic class CARumi { public String carModel; protected CarAdapter adapter; // ... CarAdapter getCarAdapter(String carModel) {/*...*/} }\\n\\nThere are several issues, both, with these attributes and with the method getCarAdapter . Users can actually use them easily even though they are just implementation details. Besides that, there is still a more dangerous issue, we are allowing users to subclass CARumi. That means users have a lot of control over our implementation and can (and probably will) take advantage of it. The main reason we don't want to allow this situation is basically to avoid giving support for unknown flows and usages.\\n\\nThe best option here is to think about the problem in reverse. Instead of working with code that is public by default, we should hide all our classes and methods and make them visible only whenever we are sure that's something we want to support. The new improved API looks like:\\n\\npublic final class CARumi { private String carModel; private CarAdapter adapter; // ... private CarAdapter getCarAdapter(String carModel) {/*...*/} }\\n\\nNow we are certain we are only exposing the desired functionality. Still our library has some usability issues. Let's go back to our API definition and see how to make our API easier to use and more robust.\\n\\nExternal classes are (kind of) evil\\n\\nWe have two different problems with our current implementation:\\n\\nThe first one is that input parameters are too restrictive . We are forcing our users to use exclusively radians and meters per second.\\n\\n. We are forcing our users to use exclusively radians and meters per second. The second issue is exactly the opposite. Our input parameters are too generic!. There is no way to avoid our users to initialize the CARumi class with a car model we can't handle or to call the throttle method with a value expressed in kilometers per hour.\\n\\nThe first thing we are going to do is to limit which car models are available. In order to do so, we are going to create an enumerate containing all our supported models:\\n\\npublic enum CarModel { DODGE_VIPER_2003_BIZAC, TOYOTA_COROLA_1993_HASBRO, /*...*/ }\\n\\nOnce we solved the initializer, let's move on into the methods to control the car. Our goal is to make these methods generic enough to be able to use alternative speed and rotation units. On the other hand, we also want to make it harder for our users to misuse the library. This can be solve by forcing them to think what units they are using. For our throttle and brake methods we can create a new class representing the power:\\n\\npublic final class Power { private Power(int metersPerSecond) {/*...*/} public static Power inMetersPerSecond(int metersPerSecond) {/*...*/} public static Power inKilometersPerHour(int kilometersPerHour) {/*...*/} public static Power inHorsePower(int horsePower) {/*...*/} }\\n\\nThere are several issues we are solving with one single class. Let's review them one by one:\\n\\nWe are reducing the chance of users sending a wrong parameter by forcing them to specify the speed units.\\n\\nWe are making our API more flexible. Most of our users won't need to convert their speed values to the ones the library supports. However, there is a chance the user is using yet another unit we didn't think about. Even in that scenario, the user has more possibilities to transform such values to something the library understands. We could also implement other Power constructors to support their unit in future releases.\\n\\nconstructors to support their unit in future releases. If we want to support other power values, we could do it while keeping backward compatibility and keeping the CARumi API as simple as it was.\\n\\nWe can move validation out of our main class. This means that we will fail earlier if there is something wrong in the user parameters.\\n\\nWe can do the same with our rotation units to obtain the same benefits:\\n\\npublic final class Rotation { private Rotation(int radians) {/*...*/} public static Rotation inRadians(int radians) {/*...*/} public static Rotation inDegrees(int degrees) {/*...*/} }\\n\\nAfter applying these changes our API will look as follows:\\n\\nCARumi v0.2.0\\n\\npublic final class CARumi { public CARumi(CarModel carModel) {/*...*/} public void throttle(Power power) {/*...*/} public void brake(Power power) {/*...*/} public void turnLeft(Rotation rotation) {/*...*/} public void turnRight(Rotation rotation) {/*...*/} }\\n\\nUpon carefully following the above guidelines, we should be pretty satisfied with our resulting API. It's flexible and dead easy to use. Best of all, we could even start using it without reading a single line of documentation!\\n\\nIn the next blog posts part this series, we will add a new feature to our library and see other problems we may find along the way of programming public APIs. We will also cover other hot topics that are not directly related to programming but are hugely important when developing open source projects.\",\n",
       " 'Make no bones about it: Rihanna’s ‘Bitch Better Have My Money’ is about Paul McCartney.\\n\\n“Sir Paul,” who has hopped on every new single by Rihanna and Kanye West, is conspicuously absent from this one. Let’s compare the new Rihanna single, “Bitch Better Have My Money,” to the previous one. ‘FourFive Seconds,’ by Kanye West and Rihanna, featuring Paul McCartney on acoustic guitar, may accurately be described as a song for moms. And said moms probably jam out to ‘FourFive Seconds’ because “that cute old man” from The Beatles is on it.\\n\\nJohn Lennon, the other half of that most famous songwriting duo, once accused Paul of writing “granny music.” So this isn’t even about Paul as an old-timer: he’s always composed mom music. Nothing against moms: without moms, none of us would walk the earth.\\n\\nBut ‘FourFive Seconds’ is an inoffensive tune: and it is a “tune” and practically a jingle. While the song pulls together Rihanna and Kanye, ‘FourFive Seconds’ has more in common with the white folk tradition embodied by, say, Mumford and Sons than anything resembling Rick Ross. ‘FourFive Seconds’ could soundtrack an Olive Garden commercial. No offense to Olive Garden, but let’s be real: the woman who gave us ‘Pour It Up’ and ‘Umbrella’ and the man who gave us ‘New Slaves’ and ‘Jesus Walks’ ideally aim for a different audience.\\n\\n‘FourFive Seconds’ has more in common with the white folk tradition embodied by, say, Mumford and Sons than anything resembling Rick Ross\\n\\nOn the contrary, ‘Bitch Better Have My Money’ knocks from the start. Anyone could have sung ‘FourFive Seconds.’ Katy Perry could have sung ‘FourFive Seconds.’ Even Miley Cyrus could have sung ‘FourFive Seconds.’ In fact, Miley’s SNL performance of ‘We Can’t Stop’ sounds almost exactly like ‘FourFive Seconds.’\\n\\nBut ‘Bitch Better Have My Money’ is a song only Rihanna could sing.\\n\\nRihanna is the only person who could sing: “Turn up to Rihanna while the whole club fuckin’ wasted / Every time I drive by I’m the only thing you playin.’” Rihanna can summon these spirits because she is, in fact, Rihanna. Her music is the only thing the club plays. It’s the only thing the whole club can turn up to.\\n\\nAnd yet, while they’re “playin” her, they cannot “play” her in the other sense of “playing,” because, as she warns again and again, “Bitch better have my money.” Rihanna never lays out the consequence for the person in question if they don’t have Rihanna’s money. But, let’s be clear, you want to have Rihanna’s money for her when she drives by the club and they’re playing Rihanna. I paid $1.29 for this song on iTunes but I would easily pay more.\\n\\nWeirdly, Rihanna’s admonishment to the listener that they “better have her money” creates a space where the listener just wants to give Rihanna money, reminding the listener of her single ‘Pour It Up.’\\n\\nBut back to the person in question who should hand over Rihanna’s royalties: Paul McCartney.\\n\\n“If I go to jail tonight,” Kanye improvised during the performance of ‘FourFive Seconds’ at the Grammys. “Paul, will you pay my bail?” Paul McCartney: you better have my money.\\n\\nPaul moves through ‘FourFive Seconds’ almost as a sideman. Kanye and Rihanna control the music, the moment, the barely-there tension the music video reveals. ‘Bitch Better Have My Money’ presents all tension at the front. The tension you can, you must, turn up to.\\n\\n‘Bitch Better Have My Money’ presents all tension at the front. The tension you can, you must, turn up to\\n\\nPaul is not there because Paul cannot be there; if he was, as during his brief show a-whistlin’ in the second half of Kanye’s recent single ‘All Day,’ he would completely defuse the flame-thrower wielding spirit of the song. And yet Paul is there: Rihanna invokes his presence as a warning. You cannot work with Rihanna and play her. Rihanna does not last for ‘FourFive Seconds.’ Rihanna is eternal. The rich don’t stay rich by being rich: they stay rich because they’re smart.\\n\\nAs Dr. Dre advises on the new Kendrick album: “But remember, anybody can get it / The hard part is keeping it, motherfucker.” Rihanna wants to keep it. She is keeping it. “You owe me,” she warns. For anyone can get Paul McCartney. Not everyone can outshine him.',\n",
       " 'Monster Hunter 4’s Third Village Is A Peaceful Island Full Of Felynes\\n\\nBy Sato . July 12, 2013 . 1:02am\\n\\nHunters are going to have it pretty rough in Monster Hunter 4, as Capcom recently introduced fearsome enemies such as the giant amphibious shark-like Zaboazagill found at the new Frozen Sea map. Capcom’s next update, however, gives us a look at a new resort-like island as the game’s third village, which looks like the perfect place for beat-up Hunters to take it easy.\\n\\nMonster Hunter 4 will be bringing back the Felyne equipment feature which was available in Monster Hunter Portable 3rd for PSP in Japan. By visiting the blacksmith, you’ll get to make various equipment such as weapons, head gear and body armor for your Felynes. The headgear will give your Felyne characteristic traits on what type of monsters they’ll attack, such as small or large monsters.\\n\\nWe’ve already seen two of Monster Hunter 4’s towns—the trading commerce, Barubare, where many travelers and hunters around the world gather, and Naguri Village, a place that is surrounded by molting lava, ideal for any blacksmith. The third area is called Chico Village, and unlike the previous two, it’s a small and calm area surrounded by the sea.\\n\\nThe village elder is an old lady of the Wyvernian race. She spends her time happily living on the island with Felynes, who call her the “Cat Granny”. Chico Village rarely sees any visitors, and it is said that the only ones living there are the Felynes and the elder.\\n\\nPocaPoca Island is a small island next to Chico Village. This island has many features that are similar to what was available on farms in previous Monster Hunter games.\\n\\nThe manager Felyne will be taking care of you on PocaPoca Island. The Felynes on the island seem troubled by a recent sighting of nearby large monsters, so they’ve been making efforts to find heroic Felynes. Their plan is to make the island a paradise that is flowing with Felynes of all kinds.\\n\\nFor example, you can send out the “Mon Nyan” Felyne crew off on quests and they’ll return with items that are needed to make Felyne equipment. There are three different routes of near, normal and far quest routes, with the further quests being tougher but more rewarding. You’ll need to equip food for them, which has a maximum of three slots and depletes as they go on quests.\\n\\nThe max amount of Felynes you can send on quests is five, and you’ll also have to take their skill types into consideration. For the first time, you’ll actually be participating in the Felyne quests by pressing the touch screen to activate their skills, however, you’ll also have to keep in mind which skills to use, as they can also back fire on you if not used properly.\\n\\nFinally, here’s a look at the new fishing machine that is available on PocaPoca Island. It requires Felynes and stock to use. It may seem easy to use, but it can be quite tricky, as the goal is to aim for an area that has more fish. If the fish move during the last second before you shoot, you’ll end up with a rather poor catch. There are also Felynes who specialize in fishing, making them a great boost for this feature.\\n\\nMonster Hunter 4 will be slated for release on September 14th, for 5,990 yen on Nintendo 3DS.',\n",
       " 'As part of a holistic effort to reduce poaching, South Africa hosted its first legal auction of rhino horn in late August after a long campaign by wildlife owners to take trade in the prized commodity out of the black market. The auction was not without controversy. For nearly 30 years, nations and nongovernmental organizations have been struggling to find ways to make legal trade in high-value wildlife products sustainable and free of corruption.\\n\\nMany in the international community have given up the search for solutions to poaching in favor of total trade bans. But the opening of a legal domestic trade in rhino horn in South Africa, coupled with the emergence of blockchain and other related technologies, offers Africans the possibility to fully benefit from their wildlife resources.\\n\\nSouth Africa is home to more than 80 percent of the world’s southern white rhinoceros population. There are more southern white rhinos in South Africa today than there were in 1970—roughly 12,000 more based on current population estimates, with one quarter of those located on private land. This rebound is in large part due to the widespread privatization of rhinos that began in 1968, along with the creation of incentives for rhino conservation that resulted from resuming live sales and regulated hunting of the animal in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\\n\\nDespite this growth, South Africa has not escaped the continent’s widely publicized rhino-poaching crisis, which stems from Asian demand for the animal’s horn. While rhino horn is a renewable resource that can be removed safely and humanely without harming the animal, the end result of poaching is usually a dead rhino. Poachers typically have no qualms about using hasty and brutal means, and their methods generally involve bullets instead of tranquilizers.\\n\\nIt would be possible to use a rhino’s DNA barcode as the unit recorded by a blockchain. Such a system would keep account of rhino horns within the legal market.\\n\\nRhinoceros are a high-value wildlife species that also bring high maintenance costs. While a live rhino can be bought in South Africa for the equivalent of roughly $27,000, owners must also contend with upkeep expenses such as veterinary care and private security. In response to increases in rhino poaching, many landowners have resorted to fielding their own anti-poaching guards or employing private security firms to safeguard the animals they steward. According to reports from conservancy owners, such security can cost an operator more than half a million dollars per year. This significant additional cost has had an expected effect: It has decreased the economic competitiveness of rhino conservation on private lands in South Africa, threatening the nation’s southern white rhino recovery.\\n\\nRather than turn their backs on the rhino, South African landowners proposed domestic legalization of the rhino-horn trade, envisioning that the funds raised would be used to offset the ballooning costs of conservation. The government granted their wish when it legalized trade in rhino horn earlier this year. The hope is that by maximizing the value of live rhinos to landowners and creating another rhino-based revenue stream, incentives to conserve the animal will be preserved.\\n\\nUnder draft regulations issued in July by the South African government, only trade in whole horns will be allowed, and horns can only be exported for non-commercial uses. Horns for export will also be subject to DNA tests and contain a microchip and serial number as well as the appropriate permit under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.\\n\\nWhether this is enough to safeguard the integrity of the market and the security of rhino populations is yet to be seen. However, opportunities exist to leverage existing technologies to strengthen South Africa’s rhino-horn trading system and create a sustainable and thriving marketplace. Combining DNA indexing systems with a blockchain, for instance, would allow for legally acquired rhino horns to be traded and tracked through an unalterable ledger, thereby limiting opportunities for illicitly obtained horns to enter the system. Such a framework would also safeguard buyers from future claims that they have acquired poached horns.\\n\\nRhino DNA indexing systems, like the RhODIS project launched by the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory of the University of Pretoria, are already in use in South Africa. These systems differentiate between legally and illegally acquired rhino horns in government stockpiles. Integrating them into the wider domestic market would allow horns to be made available for legal sale. The indexing works by scoring a unique genetic fingerprint for each rhino, using DNA sequences from each animal. This in turn produces a unique “barcode” for each rhino. The system is sound enough that its records have been successfully used in court cases brought against illicit wildlife traffickers.\\n\\nBlockchains are also becoming more common, most notably as a core component of the digital currency Bitcoin, but also in efforts to register land titles in countries from Ghana to Sweden. At its most basic level, a blockchain is a constantly evolving ledger of records that are secured cryptographically. It functions as a distributed ledger capable of durably and verifiably recording transactions via a peer-to-peer network with established protocols for validating new records. Each record, or “block,” is linked to a previous record along with a timestamp and transaction data. Once recorded, a block is impossible to alter without changing all subsequent blocks, which would require the consent of the entire peer-to-peer network, meaning the system is extremely difficult to corrupt.\\n\\nIt would be possible to use a rhino’s DNA barcode as the unit recorded by a blockchain. Such a system would keep account of rhino horns within the legal market, as well as the identities of buyers and sellers. Theoretically, this approach could be applied not only to whole, raw horns but also to value-added products like Jambiya daggers favored in parts of the Arab world and antique objets d’art, since the weight of horn relative to each barcode could be captured within the ledger. This would have the effect of reducing marketplace porousness with regard to illicitly acquired horn. It would also allow law enforcement agencies to focus their resources more effectively while providing wildlife owners an additional source of income to fund security programs that deter poaching.\\n\\nWith the resumption of legal sales of rhino horn, South Africa has taken a bold and necessary step in the effort to deter poaching and support rhino conservation by maximizing the economic value these animals hold. The task now is to structure the trade in such a way that it achieves its stated conservation goals and does not add to or exacerbate the challenges it seeks to overcome. DNA indexing and blockchain technologies together hold part of the answer to the question of how to make trade in rhino horn sustainable, making it much more likely that efforts to conserve the animal will be as well.',\n",
       " \"Dodge Pond, which sits on the outskirts of East Lyme, Conn., is an ordinary New England lake. It’s home to fish like bluegill and alewife, along with smaller organisms like water fleas, algae, and bacteria. There are viruses in Dodge Pond, too, most of which infect its bacteria. And one of Dodge Pond’s viruses, known as OMKO1, has now earned it a place in medical history.\\n\\nEarlier this year, in an experimental treatment, doctors put 100 million OMKO1 viruses into a man’s chest to save his life.\\n\\nI recently met that man. Dr. Ali Khodadoust is an ophthalmologist who works in New Haven, 40 miles west of Dodge Pond. When I arrived in Khodadoust’s waiting room, he was going over some forms with his secretary. His shock of hair was nearly as white as his doctor’s coat. We headed into his office, Khodadoust walking slowly and guardedly. “I may tip over at any time,” he confessed.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nSo would I if were 80 years old and had spent the past four years fighting a devastating infection. All things considered, Khodadoust seemed in good health — certainly good enough to chat for two hours about OMKO1, about his illness, about his long career transplanting corneas and training new doctors.\\n\\nDuring our conversation, he would sometimes carefully rise from his chair to lead me down hallways so that he could show me fading framed photographs chronicling his work at Johns Hopkins and Yale, as well as in Shiraz, the Iranian city where he was born and to which he returned to build an eye hospital.\\n\\nIn 2012, all that came to a halt. “I was working in the operating room on a Friday, and Saturday I went jogging,” Khodadoust told me. “At the end of the jog I felt a very slight shortness of breath. Two of my brothers had had heart attacks, so I said I’d check it out.”\\n\\nKhodadoust ended up having a coronary artery bypass; his cardiologist patched a section of his aorta with a piece of plastic mesh. The whole procedure went off without a hitch, after which Khodadoust went home to recover. But things quickly went south. Within 48 hours, he had developed a raging fever and had to be rushed back to the hospital. When surgeons opened his chest, they discovered that an infection had destroyed his sternum, and his chest cavity was filled with blood and pus.\\n\\nWhen Dr. Deepak Narayan, a surgeon at Yale New Haven Hospital, looked in Khodadoust’s chest, he knew precisely what had happened. There was a moss-green patch on his aorta. It had to be an infection with a common species of bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. “You take one look and you know what it is,” said Narayan.\\n\\nBefore Narayan and the other doctors could even think about treating the infection, they had to save Khodadoust’s life. “He was beyond ill — his heart actually burst on the table,” said Narayan. He and his colleagues patched up Khodadoust’s heart with a piece of lung tissue, and then drained and cleaned out his chest cavity. When they were finally done, they protected his heart with a fatty membrane from his abdomen and then closed the gap where his sternum had been with muscle and skin. They doubted he would survive long.\\n\\nWhen Khodadoust thinks back to that time, he remembers being in absolute darkness. “A tiny string was stretching from me to infinity,” he said.\\n\\nHe felt he was being given a choice. “Do you want to go back or not? To be or not to be? I pictured my children, I pictured my wife. Tears in their eyes.” Khodadoust decided to return. “How can I help it?”\\n\\n‘This was not life’\\n\\nKhodadoust survived the operation. But now Narayan and the other doctors had to fight the infection that had nearly killed their patient. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is harmless to healthy people, but it can be deadly for anyone with a weakened immune system. People with cystic fibrosis can get Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in their lungs, which can lead to fatal pneumonia. Khodadoust may have gotten infected by a tiny patch of bacteria that grew on the mesh used to fix his aorta.\\n\\nNarayan and his colleagues prescribed a heavy course of antibiotics to get rid of the infection. But the bacteria turned out to be resistant and couldn’t be eradicated. Meanwhile, Khodadoust’s body made things worse. It reacted to the infection by creating a tunnel-like cavity called a fistula that formed a hole on the surface of his chest. His Pseudomonas colonized the fistula, too.\\n\\nAfter three months on antibiotics in the hospital, Khodadoust was allowed to go home. He still had a major infection, which required him to keep an IV port in his chest. Three times a day he had to take a massive dose of antibiotics to keep the bacteria at bay. Yet the microbes would still manage to overwhelm the drugs from time to time, causing sepsis and sending him back to the hospital for even more aggressive treatments. Narayan and his colleagues ruled out any more surgery. If they tried to take out the infected plastic mesh or close the fistula, they might spread the infection around even more and kill him.\\n\\n“They did not dare touch me,” said Khodadoust. “I don’t blame them.”\\n\\nKhodadoust fell in to a miserable medical limbo. “Life had no meaning with a tube connected to my chest and every eight hours having to get 8 grams antibiotics,” he said. “This was not life.”\\n\\nAnd then, out of the blue, Narayan received a visit from someone with an idea. His visitor was a young scientist named Benjamin Chan. Chan wondered if Narayan wanted to test out an experimental weapon against infections. Perhaps viruses could kill bacteria that antibiotics could not.\\n\\nChan was hardly the first scientist to have this idea. Bacteria-infecting viruses, known as bacteriophages, were discovered a century ago. They make a living by slipping inside their microbial hosts and hijacking their biochemistry to make many new copies of themselves. Many species of bacteriophages then burst out of their host, killing it in the process. One of the discoverers of bacteriophages, a Canadian doctor named Felix d’Herelle, immediately recognized that they might be able to cure bacterial infections.\\n\\nD’Herelle’s treatment came to be known as phage therapy. By the 1920s, it was common in Europe and North America. You could buy phage-laced powder for skin infections over the counter. D’Herelle brought his bacteriophages to countries including Egypt and India to tame outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.\\n\\nOnce antibiotics came to light, however, phage therapy virtually disappeared from most countries. Doctors gained more confidence in antibiotics, because they were simple chemicals that could be rigorously tested. Bacteriophages, by contrast, were mysterious, quasi-living things that scientists still barely understood. And despite phage therapy’s apparent success, its proponents had not done enough to prove that it was reliably safe and effective.\\n\\nPhage therapy still remained popular in the Soviet Union. Stalin’s soldiers had their wounds treated with viruses during World War II. After the fall of communism, some ex-Soviet researchers brought phage therapy to the West, where it attracted more curiosity this time. Decades of antibiotic prescriptions — along with rampant use of the drugs on livestock — had driven the evolution of resistant bacteria. Phage therapy might work where antibiotics failed.\\n\\nStill, since then, phage therapy research has only puttered along on a small scale. Skeptics have raised many questions about whether it can ever work on a large number of patients. And they have fretted that, under certain circumstances, bacteria could evolve resistance to bacteriophages, just like they do to antibiotics. If doctors were to blast patients with a bacteriophage, they could foster the evolution of resistance.\\n\\n“You recreate the original problem,” said Paul Turner, a virologist at Yale.\\n\\nTurner has been studying bacteriophages for over two decades, and in recent years he’s been investigating how to apply what he’s learned to phage therapy. In 2013, he hired Chan as an associate research scientist to take the lead on the project. Chan’s first order of business was to hunt for new bacteriophages that they could use to fight infections in new ways.\\n\\nHyacinth Empinado/STAT\\n\\nA daring plan\\n\\nFinding bacteriophages was the easy part. The world’s supply of these viruses is unimaginably vast — by one estimate, there are 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bacteriophages on Earth.\\n\\nChan didn’t want to find just any bacteriophage, though. He wanted to find ones that infected species that cause opportunistic infections, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. And he wanted bacteriophages that could work with antibiotics, rather than replace them.\\n\\nHis logic was simple. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for example, resists antibiotics by building powerful pumps that quickly flush out the drugs before they can cause harm. Chan and Turner wondered if there was a bacteriophage that infected the bacteria by landing on those pumps and injecting its genes inside.\\n\\nIf such a virus existed, it might be able to kill off a lot of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in an infection. The only way for bacteria to survive would be to have a mutation that made it impossible for them to make the pumps. The bacteriophage couldn’t invade them. But in the process, they would make themselves vulnerable to antibiotics. It might be possible to follow up phage therapy with antibiotics and completely wipe out an infection.\\n\\nChan began searching for his hypothetical virus. He searched samples of soil, sewage, compost, and water. Pulling the bacteriophages out of the samples, he unleashed them on Pseudomonas aeruginosa to see if any of them could infect it. To see if they were using the bacteria’s antibiotic pumps, he observed whether they could infect microbes that he had engineered to be pumpless.\\n\\nHe kept finding new bacteriophages, but none quite fulfilled his dream.\\n\\nThen Chan grabbed a sample of water that another scientist in the lab had gotten months earlier at Dodge Pond. He found a few bacteriophages in the water, too. “Just randomly in the middle of the night, I tried one and it worked,” says Chan. It attacked Pseudomonas through its pump, a molecule called outer-membrane-porin M. Chan dubbed the virus of his dreams OMKO1 (short for outer-membrane-porin M knockout dependent phage #1).\\n\\nChan and Turner began studying OMKO1 and its bacterial hosts in petri dishes. But they wanted to know if it could actually help people. Phage therapy is not approved for regular use by the Food and Drug Administration. But Chan and Turner wondered if the agency might grant a “compassionate use” exception for patients who couldn’t be cured with antibiotics.\\n\\n“You know,” Narayan told Chan, “I have the patient for you.”\\n\\nNarayan gave Chan Pseudomonas aeruginosa that had been cultured from Khodadoust’s infection. Chan unleashed OMKO1 on the bacteria, and, as he had hoped, it killed off most of the microbes. When he inspected the survivors, he found that they had altered pumps that the bacteriophages couldn’t invade. But Chan could then kill them off with antibiotics that had previously failed to cure Khodadoust. The experiment suggested that this bacteriophage might get rid of his infection.\\n\\nNarayan developed a detailed plan for the procedure and then got FDA approval for it. Meanwhile, Chan bred OMKO1 to become even more deadly against Khodadoust’s bacteria, selecting the viruses that killed the microbes fastest to produce the next generation. He then carefully prepared a purified batch of the viruses, which then had to be tested for contaminants by an outside lab.\\n\\nFinally, in January 2016, Chan made his way to Yale New Haven Hospital with a syringe loaded with a mix of OMKO1 viruses and an antibiotic called ceftazidime.\\n\\nChan was sick with worry. Even though he had done everything he could to ensure this procedure would go well, it might still go wrong. The viruses might fail to find their microbial victims and get washed away. If they did infect the bacteria, the situation could actually get worse. OMKO1 might kill so many microbes at once that Khodadoust might go into shock.\\n\\n“I distinctly remember the red cart they brought in, with all the bring-this-guy-back-to-life gear on it,” said Chan. “I thought, ‘Oh man, this can’t go bad.’”\\n\\nNarayan pushed the needle into Khodadoust’s chest and advanced it slowly. When the needle reached the aorta, though, the doctors discovered that the vessel wall had developed thick scars. Despite hours of probing, they couldn’t find a spot where they could inject the viruses to the site of the infection. “It was just a ton of stress,” said Chan.\\n\\nNarayan and his surgical team settled on a plan B. They put the bacteriophages and the antibiotics in the fistula’s opening. If they were lucky, the bacteriophages would encounter the bacteria there and make their way down to the aorta on their own.\\n\\nAfter the procedure, Khodadoust went home, resuming his daily antibiotics, and later traveled back to Shiraz to spend time with his relatives there. Five weeks after the phage therapy, a tiny spike of bone poked into Khodadoust’s fistula, causing massive bleeding. Despite the risks, his doctors in Iran decided that they had to perform surgery.\\n\\n“They didn’t have much of a choice — he would have been dead in two minutes,” said Narayan.\\n\\nNewsletters Sign up for our Daily Recap newsletter Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\\n\\nThe doctors opened Khodadoust’s chest again, repaired the damage, and replaced the plastic mesh with a new graft. The procedure saved Khodadoust’s life. But what was even more astonishing was what his doctors found when they tested the tissue from Khodadoust’s chest for Pseudomonas. They found nothing.\\n\\n“You’re in the eye of the storm and you don’t see any Pseudomonas, so clearly something must have killed it,” said Narayan.\\n\\nKhodadoust showed up at Narayan’s office over the summer, without an IV port in his chest and off antibiotics. He had recovered completely from his four-year infection. “I couldn’t believe it,” Narayan said. “He looked like a million bucks.”\\n\\nThe road ahead\\n\\nThis fall, Narayan and his colleagues presented Khodadoust’s story at a medical conference and are in the midst of publishing reports about OMKO1 and the case study.\\n\\nThey’re delighted that Khodadoust is doing well, but they don’t want to draw too many lessons about phage therapy from a single case. “Just because we discovered something doesn’t mean I think it’s going to save the world,” said Turner. “I’m not convinced yet. I want to see that data.”\\n\\nFortunately, there are signs that phage therapy is going to get some of the attention it will need to become a regular part of medicine. In January, for example, the National Institutes of Health announced a batch of grants to fund studies on phage therapy. NIH researchers are also going to run an animal trial with OMKO1. They’ll test it against Pseudomonas infections in mice, and the results of the experiment should be ready by next summer. If they turn out well, it may be possible to run a small clinical trial on OMKO1. One possibility would be to test the virus on people with cystic fibrosis, to see if it can defeat stubborn Pseudomonas lung infections.\\n\\nFor his own part, Khodadoust said, he’s grateful for whatever good the viruses did in bringing him truly back to life. “I don’t regret I decided to be,” he said.\",\n",

These companies are prompting a premature discussion on sexual orientation.\\n\\nIn addition to the boycott, OMM is urging its members to email their disapproval to DC and Marvel.

       " 'From RationalWiki\\n\\nA phantom island is an island that was or is believed to exist, but does not actually exist. Phantom islands have appeared on maps during the entire history of cartography. Legendary islands like Atlantis are not usually considered phantom islands, as their status is mythical, rather than due to errors in exploration or map making.\\n\\nCauses for reports [ edit ]\\n\\nReports of phantom islands have several causes. A common explanation is the misidentification of a genuine island. Pepys Island, for example, was in reality the Falkland Islands. Sometimes fog banks, icebergs or optical illusions are mistaken for real islands. Sometimes islands that existed in the past have disappeared due to volcanic eruptions (such as one Greek island), tectonic activity, sea level rise, or erosion. Some islands are just made up, for fraudulent or political reasons.\\n\\nPhantom islands in pseudohistory [ edit ]\\n\\nOccasionally phantom islands get a second life in theories claiming that islands or continents were discovered earlier than the date that is commonly accepted. This is especially common for islands in the Northern Atlantic: maps depicting Antillia, Estotiland, Frisland, Bacalhau, Saint Brendan\\'s Island, Brasil and Greater Ireland have all at one time or another been considered evidence for a pre-1492 discovery of the Americas. Occasionally such a theory may be true; after all, it has now been decisively proven that Vinland, which was discovered and named by Vikings, is Newfoundland. But more often than not such theories are way off and ought to be considered as pseudohistory.\\n\\nGavin Menzies [ edit ]\\n\\nA well known example is in Gavin Menzies\\' 1421: The Year China Discovered the World. Menzies uses a 1455 Portuguese map that depict the islands of \"Antillia\" and \"Satanzes\" as evidence that the Chinese reached the Americas in 1421. Menzies identifies these islands as Puerto Rico and Guadaloupe, despite the fact that Puerto Rico runs from west to east and not from north to south like Antillia, that both islands are depicted at most 2000 kilometers away from Europe, half the distance of Puerto Rico and Guadaloupe, and that the relative position of Antillia and Satanzes do not match those of Puerto Rico and Guadalupe.\\n\\nEven further from reality, Erich von Däniken claims islands depicted on the 1513 Piri Reis map constitute evidence for extraterrestrial visits to the Falkland Islands.\\n\\nPhantom islands today [ edit ]\\n\\nPhantom islands are usually considered something of the past, but even today there are islands of which the existence is not satisfactorily defined.\\n\\nNotable examples [ edit ]\\n\\nThe islands Maria-Theresa and Ernest‑Legouvé, purportedly located south of the Tuamotu islands of French Polynesia, spotted in 1843 and 1902 respectively. It is now generally accepted that both islands do not actually exist, but they still appear on some maps. Maria-Theresa is noted for its appearance in Jules Verne\\'s novels In Search of the Castaways and The Mysterious Island. A 1966 radio broadcast from Maria-Theresa was later revealed to be a hoax.\\n\\nOther examples [ edit ]\\n\\nOther phantom islands in the same area are Wachusett Reef, Jupiter Reef and Rangitiki Reef. Wachusett Reef appears in the 2005 edition of the National Geographic Atlas of the World. Another example is Kiribati\\'s Filippo Reef, which probably doesn\\'t exist, but is nonetheless mentioned in the same edition of National Geographic\\'s Atlas as well as the German Wikipedia.[1]\\n\\nBermeja \"Conspiracy\" [ edit ]\\n\\nPerhaps the most controversial contemporary example is Bermeja. Bermeja is supposedly located in the Gulf of Mexico, north of Yucatán, at 22°33′N 91°22′W\\ufeff. It has been reported on maps since the 17th century, but it has not been sighted since the 19th century, does not appear on even the oldest satellite photographs and a survey from the Mexican Marine Secretariat in 1997 did not manage to find the island. The sea around Bermeja\\'s supposed location is 40 meters deep. Bermeja\\'s \"disappearance\" is controversial, since its existence is relevant for determining the maritime border between Mexico and the United States in the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico. The case has spawned a conspiracy theory in Mexico, which claims that the CIA dynamited the island in the 1970s in an attempt to rob Mexico of part of its oil reserves. This theory has been defended by several Mexican politicians and has been reported in various media outlets.\\n\\nAccording to the Mexican government, it is likely that the island disappeared either because of sea level rise or because of tectonic events. For the Clinton-Zedillo treaty of 2000, which fixed the maritime borders between Mexico and the United States, the island was considered not to exist. If it had existed, the border would have been 100 nautical miles north of its current location.',\n",
       " 'Photo Jonathon Thorpe\\n\\n[Editor’s note: Every Wednesday New York City’s own Andrew W.K. takes your life questions, and sets you safely down the right path to a solution, a purpose or — no surprise here — a party.]\\n\\nDear Mister Double You Kay, For most of my life I’ve identified as a straight male, but for some reason, I’ve been wanting to experiment with the same sex. I still find women attractive, but I’ve always had that “what if” question in the back of my mind about men. Do you offer any advice on this? – Anonymous\\n\\nDear Anonymous,\\n\\nIt seems like there’s a spectrum of personal sexual preference that goes from extremely heterosexual on one end, all the way to extremely homosexual on the other end. But I imagine most people don’t fall all the way to one side or another, even if they choose to live that way. For lots of people, it’s a big spiral of feelings and ideas–not just a simple “this” or “that.”\\n\\nThe good thing is, only you can tell what interests you, and you don’t have to put a label on those feelings. You don’t have to identify as a “straight male” or “gay” or “bisexual.” You can just be yourself and move through this world in a way that celebrates it. That’s partying.\\n\\nAlso, you don’t have to jump right into any new experience head-on (pun intended), you can follow this new interest in a low-pressure and fun way. Start with exploring your fantasies alone before launching into a full-blown encounter with another person. Having a “what if” question in the back of your mind doesn’t mean much if a vivid fantasy doesn’t actually end up turning you on, so play out situations using your imagination.\\n\\nIf those ideas do turn you on, then follow that fantasy to the next step and try watching pornography that relates to your fantasies. And if that also turns you on, then start looking for an actual encounter. People who allow themselves to enjoy different ideas about sex are courageous. In addition to your own sexuality, I’d recommend applying this same adventurous self-awareness to other parts of your life.\\n\\nWhat other “what ifs” are in the back of your mind, beyond sex? Use this as a jumping-off point to start following all your dreams with the same intensity, bravery, and honesty that you’re applying to your sexuality. And then you’ll really be partying hard.\\n\\nYour friend,\\n\\nAndrew W.K.\\n\\nWhat advice do you have for someone facing homelessness and struggling to have a job, water, food, and other bare essentials to survive? – Tim\\n\\nDear Tim,\\n\\nFirst of all, don’t give up. Second, work your ass off. Third, stay strong and do everything you can to hold your feeling of life together. There are moments when many of us get close to the edge in different ways, and there can be almost a magnetic pull to go off the edge–kind of like riding your bike near a cliff and for some reason your whole body seems to pull towards where you don’t want to go.\\n\\nThis is the time to surround yourself with your own power. Even if there aren’t others around you to comfort you and cheer you on, there’s still you. And you can always care for yourself. That’s the most important person right now: You. Always be able to count on yourself and find strength in your own presence.\\n\\nWhile you’re with yourself, you might as well take an extremely honest look at your life and what caused you to wind up here. Be brutal with yourself. Even if it’s painful, try to take as much responsibility for your situation as you can. Even if others deserve blame, don’t blame them–and don’t blame bad luck or anything outside of your immediate self.\\n\\nWhy? Because you want to give yourself and only yourself the power to make or break your own life. The same power that got your here, also can get you out. And as you go through this experience, try to learn from the entire adventure. What’s so great about “regular life” anyway? A lot of people are miserable and they’ve got all the bare essentials covered and lots more. Comfort, security, and happiness come from inside you.\\n\\nYou have found yourself here and you must embrace it. Fight for what you want and what you love, not against what you hate and don’t want. You will make it through this. And please write back with a mailing address so I can send you some cash. Stay positive.\\n\\nYour friend,\\n\\nAndrew W.K.\\n\\nSee also: Ask Andrew W.K.: What Do You Do if You Suspect Your Man is Cheating?\\n\\nPhoto by Andrew Strasser\\n\\nDear Andrew W.K., I am 20 years old, and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I’m being pressured about joining the military or taking up a trade in construction.The problem here is, neither interest me, and I’m not cut out for the military. My problem is that I know what I don’t want to do, instead of what I do want to do. I’m not sure if you’ve lived this, but what advice would you offer someone in my shoes? Thanks,\\n\\nConfused\\n\\nDear Confused,\\n\\nConfusion is natural. We don’t need to always understand our life or know what we want to do. But in this case, being certain that you don’t want to go to the military or do construction is at least a start. Some people don’t even know what they don’t want!\\n\\nI have a feeling that somewhere, deep inside, you probably do have interests, or had some dreams at some point. A lot of times, people get taught they can’t do what they really want in life. They can only do what they should do. That can be true sometimes, but it’s absolutely false as an overall rule.\\n\\nThe entire point of life is to do what you were born to. And how do you figure out what you were born to do? By listening very closely to the feelings deep inside yourself. Ask yourself this: If you could be doing anything 10 years from now, what would it be? If money was no object, what would your ideal day-to-day existence consist of? What would make you excited to get up in the morning, even on only a couple hours of sleep?\\n\\nEven if it’s not what seems like a “job,” it’s a starting point. It’s a place where you can begin to familiarize yourself with what you really love about life. Someone might say, “I just want to eat chocolate all day.” There’s a profession for that. Someone might say, “I just want to have sex all day.” There’s a profession for that too.\\n\\nFinding out what you love isn’t hard. The hard part is believing it’s possible for you to do every day. And it is possible! For now, don’t be too hard on yourself about your confusion and feeling of no direction. This was all meant to happen too because it’s brought you to this turning point. Now you get to have fun and dream about anything you want your life to be.\\n\\nPay very close attention to the ideas that make your heart beat faster, your stomach get butterflies, and your spine get chills. That’s your soul telling you what you’re meant for. It can be extremely surprising to realize your destiny, but it’s the greatest part about being a human being. I never would’ve dreamed I was born to be a professional partier, but I followed my instincts and against all odds, it happened. If I can do this for a living, than certainly you can do what you want.\\n\\nYour friend,\\n\\nAndrew W.K.\\n\\nTen Metal Albums to Hear Before You Die\\n\\nThe Top 20 New York Hardcore and Metal Albums of All Time\\n\\nThe Oral History of NYC’s Metal/Hardcore Crossover',\n",

       " 'Phishing is one of the largest and most difficult challenges for any enterprise security team. It’s the great equalizer of security; we all have to deal with it. Well executed phishing attacks can trick people into making simple yet costly mistakes.\\n\\nOne way companies guard against these phishing campaigns is to deploy commercial intrusion detection solutions, which analyze payloads in sandboxes where they can be safely checked before reaching an employee’s inbox. This is the core competency of most email intrusion detection systems (IDS) available on the market today.\\n\\nAt Uber, we decided to build our own email IDS for a couple of reasons:\\n\\nTo drive operational benefits in price, extensibility, and performance\\n\\nTo exercise full control over features and alerts so we can adjust to evolving threats in real time\\n\\nTo capture advanced insight for debugging intrusion alerts and email processing at Uber in general\\n\\nOperational benefits drove many of our design choices, starting with the decision to build it in a cloud based web hosting environment. For example, Amazon’s AWS has native components that include SES, Lambda workers, S3 buckets, VPCs, a few EC2 hosts, a Memcached cluster, and an Elasticsearch cluster. Using an on-demand platform gives us flexibility around when and how we use the IDS while conserving both processing and costs by not running it all the time. Amazon SNS gives us a scalable way to manage queues.\\n\\nOur email IDS reflects the microservice architecture at Uber. Like our overall architecture, the IDS splits each email into several pieces and analyzes these pieces in parallel through various on-demand pipelines. We also took advantage of existing tools and services in the market, such as cloud-based services and various in-house analysis services. For example, we use an entire cluster of automated sandboxes in EC2 as well as alternative cloud-based sandboxes. This architectural strategy gave us the opportunity to explore new security services while simultaneously debugging, developing new features, and optimizing performance in existing pipelines.\\n\\nFast and Reliable\\n\\nSolving for speed and performance is a constant priority at Uber. Many commercial IDS solutions offer comparable analysis capabilities, but they’re often black boxes, so we get little debugging insight into their operations. We built two versions of our IDS to ensure email availability while we test and develop new features. Both instances run out-of-band, as to not delay the delivery of email with analysis time. One version runs in production; the other is used for testing. In this manner we can continuously develop and integrate new functionality and alert logic into our IDS, based on attacks and trends we see in the wild. Our production instance then has the ability to both alert on and delete emails in under a minute of them landing in an employee’s inbox.\\n\\nBy leveraging the existing capabilities of a large web hosting service, we were able to move much faster than developing everything ourselves. ElastiCache’s native Memcached service deduplicates certain processing events, which speeds up our ability to process campaigns and large automated bulk email. Next, the native Elasticsearch functionality lets us cluster our identical signals for campaign and impact analysis. Not only does this help us identify phishing campaigns, but it also reduces the time required to process information before we get alerts. We’ve tailored the popular GAM library into our own library, nicknamed superGAM. When our email IDS flags malicious emails, our context automation platform uses superGAM to delete the emails automatically before employees read them. Furthermore, automated monitoring—including uptime metrics and alerts on metrics—gives us an early warning system so we can address any bugs detected in the email IDS when they’re still small.\\n\\nFuture-Proof\\n\\nAn important expectation for solutions we build in-house is the ability to scale and adapt as the company grows and threats evolve. Therefore, our email IDS is designed to be highly extensible and accommodate future changes. For example, because of the way we designed our Lambda functions, we can connect or switch out other vendor products or in-house services with ease. This is important as more people with unique expertise join our team because we can easily plug in whichever tools or pipelines they bring to the table.\\n\\nAdditionally, the microservice architecture of our IDS enables separate, concurrent analysis. This means specialized members of our team can work on individual components of the IDS relevant to their specific domain expertise. For example, someone trained in reverse engineering can work on binary analysis tools, while someone else works on components dedicated to threat intel, and another person works in natural language processing. This setup allows us to continuously update and refine each part of the system in tandem with the other microservices the team develops.\\n\\nCost Effective\\n\\nBuilding our own solution reduced our annual costs to a fraction of the price of a commercial solution. With a cloud based storage service such as AWS, we can closely monitor costs and make immediate adjustments based on our needs. For example, we generate finance reports based on tags to determine the cost of specific components. In addition to increasing the speed of analysis, the deduplication efforts mentioned before play a major role in reducing processing costs.\\n\\nWe also run several intel vendor solutions alongside our IDS for extra checks on threat intelligence and email context. These are services we’re already paying for in other parts of the organization, so connecting them to IDS extracts even more value from those existing contracts, giving us additional temporal alerts regarding email senders, domains, and IP addresses being used in current attack campaigns.\\n\\nExtensibility and Beyond\\n\\nWith an extensible platform, you can continuously explore and add new capabilities as microservices are developed on the team, such as analysis for natural language processing, analysis of DOM components, or even a URL analysis engine. For example, we have plans to add an advanced static analysis pipeline, which will require strong reverse engineering capabilities. We also constantly refine our threat intelligence sources and applications. With this design, we can further develop the abstraction of rule files to decouple the alert logic from the infrastructure, with the aim of either sharing rules or open sourcing the infrastructure code later.

On Tuesday, it went on offense against those who say it is a lousy place to work.\\n\\nThousands of people showed up to McDonald\\x92s restaurants nationwide to apply for jobs on the hamburger giant\\x92s first National Hiring Day, creating lines in some places.\\n\\nThe world\\x92s largest burger chain planned to use the day to add 50,000 workers.\\n\\nMcDonald\\x92s (MCD) painted the event as a boon for an economy where more than 13 million Americans are looking for work. But the company usually staffs up for summer anyway. It added 50,000 workers in April last year, so the blitz amounts to typical hiring, compressed into a day.\\n\\nThe real purpose of the hiring campaign, industry experts say, is to portray the fast-food chain as a good employer.\\n\\n\\x93There are worse things an economic rebound could ask than, \\x91Welcome to McDonald\\x92s \\x97 may I take your order please?\\x92\\x94 Jan Fields, president of McDonald\\x92s U.S. operations, wrote in an opinion piece for the company.\\n\\nFighting the \\x93you-want-fries-with-that\\x94 jokes will be a challenge for a company whose name is often synonymous with cautionary tales about dead-end jobs. \\x93McJob\\x94 even has a place in The Oxford English Dictionary, defined as \\x93an unstimulating, low-paid job with few prospects.\\x94\\n\\nBut to people who need work, that is all beside the point. Managers at a McDonald\\x92s in Cincinnati said a dozen or so applicants had lined up by 7 a.m., an hour before the restaurant planned to start interviews. By 10 a.m., the store had interviewed 100 people and had 25 waiting.\\n\\nTiwian Irby, 28, was hoping for a full-time job and wasn\\x92t particular about what it would entail. He said he\\x92d had trouble finding regular work since being laid off from his construction job two years ago.\\n\\n\\x93A job is a job to me,\\x94 said Irby, a father of three. \\x93I\\x92ll take whatever is available.\\x94\\n\\nCortney Gatewood, 16, was looking for part-time work to save for college and didn\\x92t hesitate to consider McDonald\\x92s.\\n\\n\\x93I think it\\x92s a good place to work,\\x94 Gatewood said. \\x93I come here almost every day to eat anyway.\\x94\\n\\nDanitra Barnett, the company\\x92s U.S. vice president of human resources, said she couldn\\x92t specify how many of the 50,000 new jobs will be full time, or what they will pay. About 90% of McDonald\\x92s restaurants are owned by franchisees, and the company doesn\\x92t control what they offer in wages or benefits. Barnett said most franchisees pay more than the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25-an-hour.\\n\\nMcDonald\\x92s said it and its franchisees will spend an additional $518 million in the coming year because of Tuesday\\x92s hiring. That amounts to just over $10,000 per new employee.\\n\\nSpokeswoman Danya Proud said the company prefers to emphasize the total economic benefit of the campaign, including the money new workers will spend in their communities.\\n\\nProud said salaried managers for company-owned restaurants can make between $32,000 and $50,000 annually.\\n\\nThe company said last year that about 75% of employees at company-owned restaurants are part-time, averaging 18 hours a week.\\n\\nBut it also touts how those jobs can grow into bigger opportunities. According to the company, 30% of its executives started in McDonald\\x92s restaurants, as well as more than 70% of restaurant managers.\\n\\nWith 14,000 U.S. restaurants, Tuesday\\x92s planned additions amount to three or four new employees per restaurant \\x97 the number each store is probably usually looking for anyway, said Sara Senatore, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.\\n\\nFor Richmond, Va., area franchisee Sue Durlak, the event was an opportunity to expand the applicant pool for her 10 restaurants, and maybe find someone who can follow in her footsteps.\\n\\nShe started part-time in 1982 to supplement her income while working as a middle-school health teacher in Illinois. Now she owns several locations.\\n\\n\\x93I do look at anyone who applies, as well as the rest of my team, as the potential as a lifer,\\x94 Durlak said.\\n\\nMcDonald\\x92s is expected to release the final hiring count next week.\\n\\n\\x97\\x97\\x97\\n\\nContributing:AP Business Writers Dan Sewell in Cincinnati and Michael Felberbaum in Richmond, Va.\\n\\nCopyright 2011 The Associated Press.

       " 'Lattice 3.0: Functional Programming in Rust\\n\\nAndrew Lucker Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jun 5, 2017\\n\\n… and there were many migraines throughout the kingdom.\\n\\nOur FRP windowing library “Lattice” is finally stabilizing on APIs. The dust is settling and the result is surprisingly clean. There were many times in the development of this library where this outcome was doubtful. For an example of what this library allows us to do, see the following code:\\n\\nv.append(Text::new(\"assets/Macondo-Regular.ttf\", \"paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified paragraph justified\").color([0.4, 0.4, 1.0, 1.0]).shadow([-3,-3,3,3],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]).scale(2.0, \"em\").width(25.0, \"%\").align(\"justify\").translate_x(150.0, \"px\").translate_y(150.0, \"px\"));\\n\\nThis code renders a long paragraph with justified text in a custom font and a host of other display properties. If you squint you might even be able to see the ghost of HTML/CSS. This type of code is coming to native thanks to a host of technological advancements. Rust is at the forefront of this movement towards further empowering the programmer while preventing much of the risk that comes with such powerful abstractions.\\n\\nThe real exciting parts start though with the FRP style. ReactJS for example is an FRP inspired framework, on native we do not have as powerful of abstractions. The web has nice abstractions at the cost of a huge complicated browser requirement. What is happening currently across native programming communities is a gradual unbundling of web front-end candy into smaller irreducible native elements.\\n\\nI am sponsoring Rust right now, but the same could be said about Swift for Mac and iOS. These languages are starting to pull in much of the spirit of the Functional Programming community and channel that energy into composable code. If there is one concept to takeaway from Functional, for me that would be composability. Being able to reuse concepts without boilerplate is the hallmark of mathematical reductionist philosophy.\\n\\nTo break down the above example, why FRP is such a breakthrough in interface concepts, the sanitization and declarative semantics are key. Take for example the same code in the dominant procedural style.\\n\\nVec<Glyphs> glyphs = font.render_glyphs(\"paragraph justified paragraph justified\", 2.0*EM)\\n\\napply_color(glyphs, [0.4, 0.4, 1.0, 1.0]);\\n\\napply_shadow(glyphs, [-3,-3,3,3],[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]);\\n\\ntextwrap_justify(glyphs, 25.0, \"%\");\\n\\ntranslate_x(glyphs, 150.0, \"px\");\\n\\ntranslate_y(glyphs, 150.0, \"px\");\\n\\nThere are a couple of issues with this code. First, where is data coming from and where is it going. We can take it for granted that there is some global state being manipulated by all these elements. That alone basically rules out any clean threaded code. Second, there is an explosion of complexity in these methods. Do they work together well, or are there mutual incompatibilities. These are the things that are hard to test, even if they get integrated into the graphics platform.\\n\\nThis exploding complexity is the reason that graphics platforms are such timesinks and headaches for anyone that works with them. It’s not a programmer issue, it’s a language issue. Finally we have tools to address these design limitations, and the future is bright. Here is to more better faster UIs.',\n",
       " 'Man, some of the locals in Mountain Home do not like that so many people who don’t approve of law-breakers voted in the town paper’s poll the other day. Some of the locals left some pretty grand comments. Here’s one from Frank:\\n\\nIf all you people would read the original article and learn some reading comprehension. The County leases that corner to the Chamber of Commerce. So the chamber can do what they want with it. And they want to display the nativity scene. I would suspect most of you dont live here. We here that are southern born and bred stick to our god and our guns and really dont care what you libtards think. Merry Christmas and GOD Bless you all.\\n\\nYes, the city is trying to skirt the law by leasing the land out to a group they know is going to put Christian iconography on government space. This actually puts the city in more dubious legal water than it was already in. Even if a group to which you were leasing government land uses it to proselytize, the government still can’t allow that. That’s like saying they rented the space to a local pastor who put up a cross. It’s still sectarian religion on government property while citizens with different beliefs are being actively blocked. But now they’re obviously trying to skirt the law, and it’s clear to any objective observer.\\n\\nAnd you can just feel the Christian love dripping from “libtards.” If not there, you can certainly get it from the way “Merry Christmas” and “GOD Bless you” are snarled with no sincerity whatsoever. This is not the first time these phrases or “I’ll pray for you” have been uttered with condescending arrogance designed to make you feel inferior – to says, “Not only am I right and you are wrong, but I am a better person than you” or “You obviously can’t take care of (fill in the blank) yourself, and God won’t help you on his own, so I’ll pass along his blessing or pray on your behalf since he listens to me more.” It is a Christian’s passive-aggressive way (or a passive-aggressive Christian’s way) of putting you down.\\n\\nIt is, in my opinion, often a phrase used to get the last word in and more often than not to add insult to injury disguised behind a phrase that is actually meant to be used as a progressive thing. It is a dismissal tinged with a suggestion of smug superiority. It isn’t used in this instance for any of the reasons that are sensitive or compassionate, as “Merry Christmas,” or “God bless you,” or “I’ll pray for you” implies. It is a condescending last-word-getter.\\n\\nSaying “god bless you” or that you’ll pray for someone for the purpose of making them feel bad and making yourself feel superior, well that comes uncomfortably close to violating the spirit of the commandment not to take the Lord’s name in vain, at least as I understand it.\\n\\nAnd it doesn’t matter if we live there, we live in America. Constitutional violations in America effect all of us. I don’t live in Louisiana either, but I’m sure glad they lock up thieves there.\\n\\nHere’s another from Fire Eyes:\\n\\nThere is an ignorance of what the Constitution truly says and means on here that is disgusting and reveals just how much the liberal, anti-God crowd have succeeded in brainwashing people. Don’t tell me what courts have ruled because the courts didn’t write the Constitution. I’ll tell you what the Founders wrote hundreds of times. Read “Christianity and the Constitution” if you want to know the TRUTH. To the liberals and and Jesus haters on here, patience. It won’t be long before you have it all your way for 7 years. It only takes your way that long to destroy all of civilization. PS: Obviously the Quorum Court does NOT agree with the leftist, liberal, anti Jesus interpretation of the Constitution. I believe they far more accurately represent what this community believes than the haters on here.\\n\\nFirst, if you’re going to go about accusing others of being brain-washed, it’s probably not best to do it from a church-going culture which gets together every week to reaffirm each other’s beliefs and to say “Amen!” in unison at all of the appropriate times while insisting people believe the ludicrous contents of a book because they’ll burn forever if you don’t. If we ever wanted to get into brain-washing (which we don’t), we know where to go for lessons.\\n\\nSecond, the people who think it’s wrong to deny the local freethinkers the same privileges granted to Christians keep getting called “anti-god.” This is perplexing since if you take the legal violations and discriminatory behavior by government officials out of the equation, we wouldn’t give a shit about the creche. Likewise, if it were on a church lawn or a private citizen’s lawn, we also wouldn’t give a shit. Why are we anti-god and not anti-discrimination? Anti-god does have a more frightening ring to it, but if you so desperately want to feel persecuted you’ll abandon your honesty, then you can’t have a whole lot of real examples of being persecuted, and nobody should really listen to you.\\n\\nAs far as ignorance of the Constitution, follow me to one of the first sections of the Constitution: Article 3, Section 1 which says:\\n\\n“The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority….”\\n\\nThis specifically gives the Supreme Court the authority to interpret the Constitution under their judicial power over the law. If you take the baby step to admit the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, you are forced to accept that the Supreme Court has the right to rule on its interpretation. Yet here you are asking us to accept your assessment of Constitution and not theirs, since the interpretation of the court has consistently been that the establishment clause means there is separation of church and state.\\n\\nThere is realistically no denying that the Supreme Court has the authority to make that call, so that’s the way it is. Of course the theocrats (like Fire Eyes) will say SCOTUS made the wrong call, but no reasonable person is really going to accept the judgment of “truck stop lawyers” over decades of decisions by people whose lives are spent entrenched in the study of constitutional law and whose decisions are based on decades of established precedents. If the Separation clause is illegal, the federal judiciary must have been mistaken all these years, and still is.\\n\\nThey are the referees who have the authority to make the call, and they have clearly made the call for separation. Entertaining as the theocrat’s arguments against the Separation clause may be, they are scarcely new. By now they’ve failed to convince generation after generation of American judges. Why do you think that is?\\n\\nBecause of judicial bias or activist judges? Those are the reactionary buzz words of the day, aren’t they? Yet, there is no question that the overwhelming majority of church/state separation cases in what has undoubtedly and unarguably been a nation of Judeo-Christian background have nevertheless come down on the side separation. Let’s face it: until recently the population has been around 90% Judeo-Christian. That is the background of every single Supreme Court Justice ever, and clearly and consistently “separation” has been the winner. They haven’t done this because of their religious beliefs, but in spite of them.\\n\\nAnd also, I’m told Christianity makes people more moral. Yet here’s a person happy, literally happy at the thought of atheists suffering through hell on earth for seven years (Fire Eyes is clearly referencing the Great Tribulation in Revelations 9). Giddy at the suffering of those with whom they disagree. Christian love on full display.\\n\\nAnd you can tell me what the founders wrote. Many of them were believers. Hell, they could’ve all been Christians and it would mean for a moment that they didn’t realize that separation of church and state was essential for religious liberty. The right to freely practice being a Christian means the right to be free of a government enforcing Islam, and vice versa.\\n\\nAnd as for Fire Eyes deferring to the Quorum Court over the SCOTUS, you realize that a Quorum Court is a body of commissioners with no inherent legal authority or expertise, right? No, no you don’t.\\n\\nHere’s one from John:\\n\\nI done 23 years defending a country that was founded on the principles of God. I just can’t understand how 1 percent run the 99 percent and I agree with others on here if it offends you don’t go look at it. I am smart enough to know if I jump in front of a speeding train I will die so I don’t do it if it offends you get smart and don’t look at it\\n\\n. But I would encourage you to remember what you stood for when you are on your knees if front of the almighty God and said you denied him on earth and if you want to agree or not one day you will face God to be judged on you actions while on earth\\n\\nOur nation was not founded on god, it was founded on religious liberty. What? Do you think our founding fathers weren’t bright enough to write Jesus or Yahweh into the Constitution if they had intended special privilege for Judeo-Christians? If so you are deluding yourself (and insulting the founders of this nation for whom you purport to have such great respect).\\n\\nAn Act to regulate the Time and Manner of administering certain Oaths was the first law passed by the Congress assembled after the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. It was signed by President George Washington on June 1, 1789, and parts of it remain in effect to this day.\\n\\nBut even if you can convince yourself that our founders were too stupid to put Jesus into the Constitution if they wanted to form a Christian nation, you can still look at all the evidence confirming that we were built as a religiously pluralistic nation, not a Christian one. For instance, have you ever wondered what was the first law Congress ever passed? Well, this was it:\\n\\nEssentially the law dictated the oath most public officials had to take coming into office. It was “I, [FIRST NAME] [LAST NAME] do solemnly swear or affirm (as the case may be) that I will support the Constitution of the United States.” But this was not how it was in some original drafts, at least not entirely:\\n\\nThe oath in the final bill differed from the original proposal by excluding the two clauses mentioning God, as well as the phrase “a Representative of the United States in Congress thereof.”\\n\\nGod was proposed and they intentionally took it out. This is very strange if our founding fathers intended us to be a nation founded up (the Christian) god.\\n\\nAnd we all know of the Treaty with Tripoli in 1797. Article 11 of that treaty reads, in part: “the government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion…”. It’s right there in black and white in one of our nation’s primary documents. In America’s historical documents (not just quote-mine attempts of some of its influential figures) you will not find the opposite; claims that America was founded on the Christian religion. Not only did Washington read and approve the Treaty with Tripoli, the treaty was not ratified by the senate (it bears mention that it was ratified unanimously) until John Adams had been elected. When he signed it, Adams also wrote beneath his signature “Now, be it known, that I, John Adams, President of the United States of America, having seen and considered the said treaty, do, by and within the consent of the Senate, accept, ratify and confirm the same, and every clause and article thereof.”\\n\\nAnd if we were a Christian nation, the Confederacy in the Civil War wouldn’t have felt the need to make all the changes they did. For instance, consider the preamble to the US Constitution against that of the Confederacy. Here’s the preamble for the US Constitution:\\n\\n“We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”\\n\\nAnd here’s the preamble for the Confederate Constitution:\\n\\nWe, the people of the Confederate States, each State acting in its sovereign and independent character, in order to form a permanent and federal government, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity—invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God—do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America.\\n\\nNotice a difference? Which is why when Fire Eyes says they can tell me what the founding fathers wrote I just smirk. Many of them were Christians, but that didn’t mean they wanted a theocracy. Having seen the effects of a State Church in England, it makes perfect sense for our founders, even the Christian ones, to have a vested interest in religious liberty – hence the first amendment. What is far more telling of their intent is the laws and bills they passed (and what they didn’t write into them, namely anything to do with a theocracy).\\n\\nAnd as for this “majority rules” bullshit, no. While majority vote is how we resolve questions of government, if the whims of the majority would deprive other citizens of equality or liberty, the Constitution nullifies it. This is why even if the majority wanted to put atheists in internment camps they’d be unable to do so. It’s also why almost every court that hears a challenge to a gay marriage ban, voted on by the majority of citizens, has struck them down. Do you think judges just don’t get that the majority voted for them or just don’t understand the Constitution? Get real.\\n\\nAnd as far as “if you don’t like it, don’t look at it” goes, does that go the same for any other injustice? Hey, don’t like slavery? Don’t look at it. It’s not that we give a fuck about the creche, but we do give a fuck about municipalities that violate the Constitution and create second-class citizens of others. Damn right I don’t like injustice. The solution is to fix it, not to look away. When was your moralizing religion going to imbue you with that simple and obvious moral conclusion?\\n\\nAnd of course, no bit of Christian outpouring would be complete without a threat at the end. Do as I say or god is going to roast you forever. Threats of pain are weak and speak to your morals. When you live your religion that way your religion disgusts me. This is why Christianity is losing out hardcore on the upcoming generation.\\n\\nThere are far more comments like these, but you get the gist.',\n",
       " '(CNN) There\\'s a strange resemblance between religious conversion stories and weight-loss ads: both rely on astutely edited \"before\" and \"after\" images.\\n\\nTo sell slimming products, the camera first shows a man facing forward, flaunting his flabby gut and lumpy love handles.

Hide Caption 13 of 13\\n\\nTo some extent, Carson\\'s campaign, as well as his longstanding popularity among conservative Christians , is built upon the stories he tells about himself and his relationship with God, including the narrative of his dramatic conversion from a violent young man to spiritual tranquility.\\n\\nAs a teen growing up in Detroit, Carson says, he reacted angrily to perceived slights, trying to bash his mother with a hammer after an argument about pants and attempting to stab a close friend -- an unnamed relative, he now says -- over a radio.\\n\\nIf those incidents seem to contradict Carson\\'s sedate public persona, that\\'s the point. Only God could change a man that much, he says, telling the story of how, after trying to knife his relative, he prayed in a bathroom for three hours, asking the Almighty to tame his raging temper.\\n\\n\"When I came out of that bathroom I was a different person,\" Carson says . \"I had really had an experience with the Lord.\"\\n\\nIn a story published last Thursday, though, childhood friends told CNN they don\\'t recall any of the vicious fights Carson has detailed. Neither do such stories jibe with their recollection of him as a bookish, quiet kid, his friends said.\\n\\nCarson retorted that CNN had \"talked to the wrong people\" and said the person he almost stabbed does not want to talk to the media, which he accused of conducting a \"witch hunt.\"\\n\\n\"The burden of proof is not going to be on me to corroborate everything I have ever talked about in my life,\" Carson told journalists\\n\\nWhether or not every detail can be corroborated, Carson\\'s conversion story has long plucked a powerful chord among evangelicals, said Ted Olsen, managing editor of the magazine Christianity Today.\\n\\nIt follows a script familiar to many born-again Christians, Olsen said: \"I had an issue in my life. I was going down the wrong path. I turned to God and surrendered my bad behavior, and (God) took it from me.\"\\n\\n\"That kind of story rings true among a lot of evangelicals.\"\\n\\n(Carson also embodies a common evangelical fantasy, Olsen added: The man so peaceful that strangers ask for his secret, opening an opportunity to evangelize about Jesus. It has the added benefit of deflecting attacks from people like Donald Trump who say Carson is too chill to be commander in chief.)\\n\\nIn Carson\\'s church, Seventh-day Adventism, personal testimonies are not particularly common, though they are offered occasionally during worship on Saturdays, said Dan Weber, a spokesman for the denomination.\\n\\nBut since the early days of the evangelical movement, nearly all born-again Christians have been expected to know the exact hour they \"made a decision for Christ,\" in the memorable words of evangelist Billy Graham.\\n\\nWithout a conversion -- and a coherent story about it -- your commitment to the church could be considered suspect, said Bruce Hindmarsh, a professor of spiritual theology at Regent College and author of \"The Evangelical Conversion Narrative.\"\\n\\n\"On the whole, people are trying to bear witness to the fact that God has broken into their lives, that God still acts in the present world,\" Hindmarsh said. \"It\\'s not supposed to be a story about yourself. It\\'s supposed to be about God.\"\\n\\nThe most memorable conversion stories are often the \"stickiest,\" to use Malcolm Gladwell\\'s popular phrase: easy to understand but surprising and bit counterintuitive. The persecutor of Christians, like St. Paul, who became one of the faith\\'s most ardent apostles. The Oxford atheist, like C.S. Lewis, who turned Christian apologist. The raging boy, like Carson, who matures into an elder statesman.\\n\\nBut the apotheosis of autobiography can have its drawbacks, many evangelicals say: the temptation to tell a story that sounds, and might be, too good to be true.\\n\\nAmong the more notorious examples of salvation slipping into showmanship was Mike Warnke, a Christian comedian and evangelist who claimed to have converted after a violent and scandalous sojourn as a high priest in Satanism.\\n\\n\"Exaggeration did creep into some of my stories,\" Warnke later admitted to an Oklahoma newspaper in 2000 , \"but my testimony is still my testimony.\"\\n\\nMore recently, several evangelicals have been accused of telling tall tales about their Muslim past , with some suggesting they were involved in terrorism before converting to Christianity. Five years ago, for example, Liberty University, one of the country\\'s largest evangelical schools, removed its seminary dean, Ergun Caner , after finding that he had \"made factual statements that are self-contradictory.\"\\n\\n\"Testimony envy may be part of any community,\" Olsen wrote in an editorial after Caner\\'s removal, \"but we evangelicals seem to have a particular bent toward narrative one-upmanship.\"\\n\\nCarson is far from the first presidential candidate to face scrutiny about his conversion story. In his campaign biography, George W. Bush recounts a private walk with Billy Graham in Maine in 1985. The aging evangelist \"planted a mustard seed in my soul,\" Bush later wrote, leading him to quit the bottle and get serious about God.\\n\\nInvoking Graham, a man revered by millions of evangelicals, was politically astute. The story made the rounds in evangelical publications like Charisma magazine . But asked by reporters for his own recollections, Graham admitted that he had little memory of the famous \"walk.\" And other pastors in Texas suggested that Bush was well on his way to redemption years before the aging evangelist came to Kennebunkport.\\n\\nCollapsing multiple stories into one anecdote and giving a famous preacher more credit than he deserves aren\\'t considered cardinal sins in American politics. In the end, condensing his faith journey didn\\'t cost Bush much, said Randall Balmer, a professor of history at Dartmouth College and author of \"God in the White House.\"\\n\\nFor Carson, the stakes are quite a bit higher, Balmer said.\\n\\n\"His whole campaign is based upon his narrative, because he has no political experience and no record of public service,\" said Balmer. \"If it is undermined or called into question, it\\'s going to be tough for Carson.\"\\n\\nEvangelicals experts agreed. A little fuzzing around memory\\'s edges is expected. Inventing stories about a violent past would be far less forgivable.\\n\\n\"His selling point is that he is a man of integrity, said Michael Duduit, dean of the College of Christian Studies at Anderson University in South Carolina. \"If it turns out he made up stories out of whole cloth, that would be very disconcerting.\"\\n\\nFor 30 years, Duduit -- an expert on preaching -- has been schooling evangelical pastors on how to make a story stick while sticking to the facts.\\n\\n\"I tell them it\\'s OK to tell a story. Jesus told stories,\" Duduit said. \"Just don\\'t add details that didn\\'t happen. If you do, four or five millennials in the congregation will start Googling you before the sermon is even over.\"',\n",
       " 'Germans Are Drinking Less Beer These Days, But Why?\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Johannes Simon/Getty Images Johannes Simon/Getty Images\\n\\nFor centuries, Germany has been synonymous with beer. Tourists flock from around the world to take part in the country\\'s many beer festivals, including the famous Oktoberfest.\\n\\nBut officials say the German beer tradition is waning. A recent government report found Germans drink less beer now than they did a generation ago. To find out why, I visited some pubs and brew experts in Berlin — and heard a range of explanations.\\n\\nAt the Max and Moritz tavern, in a former working-class neighborhood of the German capital, beer once flowed as freely as the nearby Spree River. The pub is named after the characters of a beloved children\\'s tale whose images adorn the walls and shelves, but it\\'s the beer that this tavern is famous for.\\n\\nAs in most traditional German pubs, local brews are served here from taps or in bottles. On the night I visited, most customers were drinking wine or soda pop.\\n\\nOne of those drinking a soda was my husband\\'s friend, Jan Katzmarczyk, a German lawyer who has sworn off alcohol for Lent. Even when he does drink, the 41-year-old says, he rarely orders a beer anymore — maybe two a week, but not more.\\n\\nHe took us to several well-known pubs in Berlin to see what his country\\'s statistics agency is reporting: that Germans — despite consuming 2 1/2 billion gallons of beer last year — are drinking less beer now than at any time since 1990.\\n\\n\"People might drink less because it has lots of calories,\" Katzmarczyk says. \"People are thinking much about their bellies, and beer is not helping.\"\\n\\nAt a nearby tavern called Zur Kleinen Markthalle, or \"small market hall,\" there were more beer drinkers. But bartender Andreas Varrelman confirmed what the government is reporting: Fewer patrons order beer these days.\\n\\nHe blamed the decrease on Germany\\'s economic crisis, saying he thinks people are more reluctant to go out and spend money, including on beer.\\n\\nMarc-Oliver Huhnholz, spokesman for the German Brewers Association, says the waning interest in beer is more about changes to German society.\\n\\n\"We have a shift of the population — the people become older and less younger are following,\" he says. That means there are fewer Germans in younger age groups, which are more typically associated with beer-drinking.\\n\\nGermans are drinking less beer now than at any time since 1990.\"\\n\\nHuhnholz adds that there are also fewer jobs in fields once associated with drinking beer, like mining and construction. \"When the people have built a house or something like this, they opened the first bottle at 8 o\\'clock in the morning,\" he says. \"Now we have computer work, we have much more mobility, so people are driving cars.\"\\n\\nAnd that means less drinking of alcohol, be it beer or anything else.\\n\\nDespite the decrease, Huhnholz notes that Germany is still among the top three beer-drinking countries in Europe. The 28 gallons of beer per capita Germans consume every year far exceeds what Americans drink — 21 gallons per capita.\\n\\nTo lure more Germans back to beer-drinking, Huhnholz\\'s brewers are experimenting with new products, including tasty nonalcoholic beers and fruit-flavored beers, as well as unusual mixes, like beer with cappuccino.',\n",

A ruling is expected Thursday.\\n\\nThe Liberal government has also promised to hold a public inquiry into the alleged abuse.\\n\\nMcNeil said the terms of reference will be set out to give former residents an opportunity to publicly share their stories, something that should happen early next year.\\n\\n\"This is not an inquiry that will be loaded up with lawyers. It\\'s an inquiry that\\'s about healing,\" he said Friday.\\n\\nFormer resident Tracey Dorrington-Skinner said she hopes the process will hear from as many people as possible.\\n\\nThe apology offered Friday served as validation and was a good first step on the road to healing, she said.\\n\\n\"The journey continues and I just hope that everyone takes advantage of the offer from the government to seek the help that they need,\" she said.\\n\\nThe home is now a short-term residential facility for children of all races.\\n\\nBy Keith Doucette, The Canadian Press',\n",

       " 'Scientists are a skeptical bunch. We never accept claims without evidence and we spend large parts of our careers trying to show that other scientist\\'s claims are wrong. This self scrutiny is one of our best traits, and it is a major reason why science advances over time.\\n\\nWith this said, it often surprises people that scientists are in such strong agreement about human impacts on the Earth\\'s climate. Many studies, including research by Doran and Zimmerman, Anderegg and colleagues, and more recently by my colleague\\'s team, Cook et al., have shown conclusively that the world\\'s climate scientists agree, to about 97 percent, that humans are significantly impacting the climate. But many people ask, how can they be so sure?\\n\\nThere are a number of reasons why we know humans are causing many of the changes we are seeing today. Among them, is the use of attribution studies, often called \"fingerprinting\". Scientists look at the patterns of climate change and ask, do they have the fingerprint of natural variation, or humans?\\n\\nOne of the most well-known climate change attribution scientists is Dr. Benjamin Santer. He and his team have developed tools to separate natural climate variations from human-induced changes by using a number of different tools. Their latest work was just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and is titled \"Human and Natural Influences on the Changing Thermal Structure of the Atmosphere\".\\n\\nThe method is somewhat complex; it involves the comparison of climate observations with the output of climate models. Specifically, they compared satellite observations from two different groups, with output from 20 climate models that participated in the most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP-5). In the models, they calculated what the Earth would be like without us. The \"world without us\" scenarios have natural changes to the environment caused by volcanoes, the Sun, and internal climate variability (phenomena like El Niños and La Niñas). They wanted to know whether the \"world without us\" could have displayed the types of changes to the climate that we are seeing today.\\n\\nNext, the scientists calculated what the Earth would be like if human emissions had occurred, but natural variations in volcanoes and the Sun had not. These \"human only\" simulations tell us what we expect the impact to be from greenhouse emissions alone; they give us an estimate of the human \"fingerprint\".\\n\\nFinally, the models were used to estimate the amount of internal variability in the climate, without human impacts or forced changes from volcanoes and the sun. This third step quantifies the impact of things like El Niños, La Niñas, and other natural variations.\\n\\nWith these three calculations complete, the scientists then went to the observational record, extracting data from satellite measurements of the Earth\\'s climate. They searched the measurements for the \"human only effect\" by comparing the measurements to the three sets of simulations. In particular, they looked at the signal-to-noise ratio, which helps tell them which of the three solutions (\"world without us\", \"human only\" or \"natural variability\") fit the observations best.\\n\\nWhat did they find? Certain patterns emerge that are consistent with the \"human only\" scenario. For instance, the heating of the lower atmosphere and cooling of the upper atmosphere, which satellites clearly see, could only happen if human emissions were the culprit. But the study went further; they actually stacked the deck of cards in favor of nature. They used solar and volcanic variations much larger than those that actually occurred since 1979. The strategy was to see if even a worst case \"world without us\" could be made to look like the current measurements. But, even that didn\\'t work. The human influence still stood out.\\n\\nPerhaps the best summary is in the abstract of the paper.\\n\\n\"We show that a human-caused latitude/altitude pattern of atmospheric temperature change can be identified with high statistical confidence in satellite data. Results are robust to current uncertainties in models and observations … Our results provide clear evidence for a discernible human influence on the thermal structure of the atmosphere\".\\n\\nIn climate science, as with most science, formal proofs are not possible. But I\\'ve read hundreds or perhaps thousands of scientific articles in my life, and this is about as convincing as it gets.',\n",

Nugent said, “Then they see an administration that is spitting on the US Constitution, the Ten Commandments, the Bill of Rights and the Golden Rule.”\\n\\nMedia Matters:\\n\\nNugent said, “Everybody I hang with the ranchers, the farmers, the cops, the teachers, everybody I hang with, they got an alarm clock. They get up they put their heart and soul into the being the very best they can be. They want to be an asset to their families, their neighborhood. They want to be the best they can be. They want to be productive members of society, and then they see an administration that is spitting on the US Constitution, the Ten Commandments, the Bill of Rights and the Golden Rule, so we the tea parties, we the people who are speaking up, I’m gonna quote my hero Dr. Martin Luther King, we who engage in non violent direct action are not the cause of tension, but rather bring it to the surface a tension that already exists. That’s the job of we the people to be watchdogs and whistleblowers. The government works for us. They’re absolutely out of control. The Tea Party, and what you stand for Sean, and I stand for, one big a-word, accountability. That’s our money, at least be honest and accountable.”\\n\\nTed Nugent has now become a non violent pacifist, but this video demonstrates otherwise:\\n\\nIn case you could not understand the audio, Nugent said, “I was in Chicago last week I said—Hey Obama, you might want to suck on one of these you punk? Obama, he’s a piece of shit and I told him to suck on one of my machine guns… Let’s hear it for them. I was in NY and I said hey Hillary—you might want to ride one of these into the sunset you worthless bitch… Since I’m in California, I’m gonna find- she might wanna suck on my machine gun! Hey, Dianne Feinstein, ride one of these you worthless whore. Any questions? Freeeeedom!”\\n\\nNugent is one to talk about accountability, when he has no semblance of it in his own life. The same man who was sitting with Sean Hannity discussing accountability once had to be hauled into court because he was a deadbeat dad who refused to support his illegitimate child, or how about Nugent admitting that he is a coward, who chickened his way out of serving his country in Vietnam? There is an a-word that comes to mind when I think of Ted Nugent, and it isn’t accountability. I can also think of an h-word, hypocrite.\\n\\nMuch like all of the other right wingers, Nugent is outraged that Obama is taking away God and freedom, yet he can’t name any freedoms that have been taken away or any instance where God has been lost. Ted Nugent’s little rant to Sean Hannity gives us a chance to point out that the Tea Party is nothing new. The same things that Nugent said about Obama were said about Bill Clinton in the 1990s, Ted Kennedy in the 1980s, Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, heck some of these things were even said about John F. Kennedy in the 1960s, and before him, FDR.

He’s not particularly loud or imposing—indeed, he has an easy, matter-of-fact manner of speaking. And though at well over six feet he’s often the tallest person in the room, it’s not just his stature that draws eyes. Meyer has a talent for recognizing—and delivering—a hook. He knows what kind of anecdote or punch line will garner interest and starts there when telling a story.\\n\\nLast March, while he was an algebra teacher at San Lorenzo Valley High School in California, Meyer gave a presentation on math instruction for TEDx—a community-organized spinoff of the yearly TED Talk conferences, which are famous for gathering global thought leaders. The video of the talk, entitled “Math Class Needs a Makeover,” went viral, receiving hundreds of thousands of hits on both TED.com and YouTube.\\n\\nLife for Meyer has not been the same since. The number of RSS subscribers to his blog jumped from 3,000 to 6,000. He’s been flooded with requests for speaking events and interviews. His schedule is now booked months in advance. The math-ed world is buzzing with his name.\\n\\n—Manny Crisostomo\\n\\nThe premise behind the much-celebrated TED Talk is a simple one: Drop the textbooks and present math in a way that mimics the real world.\\n\\nThe path that led Meyer, who is now pursuing a Ph.D. in curriculum design, to that premise—and to math-teacher stardom—is a bit more convoluted, however.\\n\\nA Visual Orientation\\n\\nMeyer, who grew up in Ukiah, Calif., a town of 15,000 a few hours north of San Francisco, says his early schooling amounted to him sitting around the kitchen table with his mom and sister. He was home-schooled from kindergarten through 8th grade before attending a public high school. Meyer had an early predilection for math, and was especially interested in applying numbers and equations to his daily life—though he stresses that this was not the result of some innovative homeschooling approach. Meyer simply enjoyed seeing how math could “make sense of the world.”\\n\\nNotwithstanding his draw toward numbers, Meyer hoped to go to film school for college. “I had no idea what I was doing. But I loved the language and grammar of film,” he says. He applied to the University of Southern California with what he calls a “ridiculously meager portfolio,” including videos he’d edited on his VCR for Spanish class, and was rejected. He decided instead to major in math at the University of California, Davis, feeling like a “sellout.”\\n\\nDan Meyer on Real-World Math\\n\\nLittle did he suspect that his understanding of film and “orientation toward the visual” would become critical elements in his career as a math educator.\\n\\nMeyer says he didn’t have a strong calling to become a teacher, but a friend at U.C.

The experience was eye-opening and enjoyable, in part, he now realizes, because he was working with “a great class of honors students.” Meyer stayed on at U.C. Davis after his senior year for a post-graduate teaching program.\\n\\nIn graduate school, Meyer discovered that having an understanding of math wasn’t enough—teachers also need what’s known as “mathematical knowledge for teaching,” or MKT. He describes MKT as the difference between being able to devise a formula yourself and being able to teach someone else to devise a formula.\\n\\nMeyer worked hard in graduate school but saved time for some fun—his own peculiar kind. In 2004, he set the Guinness World Record for chaining paperclips together over a 24-hour period. Even here, his math skills were integral. “I had a spreadsheet running you wouldn’t believe,” he says. He developed formulas to predict the time at which he would break the record and the end-length of the chain based on his pace throughout the day. He recruited friends to fill in the spreadsheet at designated intervals and keep him apprised of his progress. (Otherwise, he explains, “it becomes very easy to hypnotize yourself and think you’re going fast when you’re not.”)\\n\\nHis record, at 54,030 paperclips and reaching over a mile long, still stands. Meyer’s a bit sheepish about telling the story, but offers a succinct take-away: “Math got the job done.”\\n\\nThe Plot of a Math Problem\\n\\nDespite his appreciation of MKT, Meyer describes his first year in the classroom, teaching math at Florin High School in Sacramento, as “disastrous.” He stuck to a traditional format—lecturing and then assigning practice problems. On days he misjudged his timing and ran out of things to say, he’d let students start their homework in class. “Name the cliché, I satisfied it,” he recalls.\\n\\nMeyer can pinpoint with clarity the moment his practice began to evolve: It was when he hooked up a digital projector.\\n\\nAt first, he was conservative in his use of the medium, projecting text-heavy PowerPoint slides as a supplement to his own notes. But he soon began dropping the verbiage in favor of full-screen images and videos that he used to illustrate math problems. Among his students, the visuals became “conversation pieces that would inspire the mathematcal investigation,” he says.\\n\\nBefore long, Meyer found himself bringing in more real-world examples and straying further from the textbook. And he recognized a fundamental difference between the way the textbook presented a problem and the way he might solve a problem in his own life.\\n\\nFor Meyer, a math problem in the real world has a narrative arc, like a film. “The first act is punchy,” he explains. “You can summarize the premise of every blockbuster movie in a sentence. ‘Shark terrorizes seaside town,’ that sort of thing.” In a math problem, the premise is a question, such as, “How long will it take me to get to Los Angeles?”\\n\\nDuring what he calls the “second act” of a film, the characters encounter obstacles and find out what they need to do. In a math problem, the second act involves measuring, determining a formula, or finding out what information is missing.\\n\\nIn the conclusion of a film, the plot reaches a climax and the conflict is resolved. The same goes for a math problem. And in both film and a problem, there’s also a chance to set up a sequel, or extensions, he explains.\\n\\nHowever, in a textbook, Meyer says, all of these elements are compressed onto a single page. He refers to this as “psuedo-context” or “pseudo-problem solving.” Generally, he says, a textbook labels the variables and presents all of the measurements upfront. It then asks students several questions leading up to the premise. The intent is to scaffold the material and help students along the way. But, in effect, it does the opposite. Seeing all the material at once is “overwhelming,” says Meyer. “It excludes a lot of people from the process.”\\n\\nThe math problem’s hook is in that final question, or the premise. So that’s where Meyer starts.\\n\\nFor example, when teaching high schoolers, Meyer uses the digital projector to display a photo of himself shooting a basketball. Meyer has doctored the photo so that it shows the ball at several different points along the trajectory, stopping at the apex. “When I put that up on the board, the premise of that problem is obvious to every student. I don’t even have to say it. ‘Will the ball go in?’ That’s what we’re all wondering,” he says.\\n\\nThen Meyer asks the students to figure out what information they need to determine whether his shot will go in. The students discover they have to measure the arc and need a protractor to do so—in a way writing their own second act. A textbook would have provided this information, Meyer says. But in the real world, “When on earth do you get all the information you need before you know you need it?”\\n\\nThe students can then solve the problem on their own. “The nice thing is that the conclusion of this problem doesn’t come from the back of the book,” says Meyer. “The answer is me playing the video of that exact same shot. And the students see that, ‘Oh, he hit the rim just like I found out.’ I don’t have to use my authority, or the textbook publisher’s authority to say, ‘You’re right.’ They can actually see that they’re right.”\\n\\nLess Is More\\n\\nThis is all part of what Meyer calls “delegating the sense-making of math to students.” Teachers have a tendency to summarize findings and link concepts, but students should learn to do this on their own, he says. In other words, Meyer says, teachers should “be less helpful.”\\n\\nAt first, when presented with real-world problems, students are hesitant, even reluctant. “It takes a particular deprogramming to wean students off the hard drug of easy answers and having all the information presented to them,” according to Meyer.\\n\\nBut over the course of the year, he says, his classes undergo a striking change. Students begin volunteering questions more readily after the problem has been introduced. “They don’t need very much prodding at all at a certain point,” he says. And Meyer can lecture less, which saves time for students to apply their problem-solving skills.\\n\\nMeyer’s instructional method has another effect that he did not initially anticipate. “In terms of the hard procedural skills, like factoring trinomials—the stuff that kids find unapproachable sometimes—I can just put a problem up on the board and say, ‘Do what you can with this,’” he says. “They attack the problem similarly to how they would attack the application problems with the visuals and the storytelling structure.” With less hand-holding, in other words, his students become more curious and persistent.\\n\\nMeyer admits that textbooks often have “good ideas.” At times, he still turns to them for material—looking first at that last question on the page. But whenever possible, Meyer uses math problems he encounters in his own life.\\n\\nRecently, for example, Meyer saw a commercial for Orbeez—small, hard beads that, according to the company that markets them, will grow to 100 times their size when soaked in water. “I’m hard-wired,” said Meyer, “and I’m assuming that all math teachers are on some level hard-wired, to ask the question: ‘Is that legit? Is it really 100 times bigger?’”\\n\\nRecognizing these kinds of real-world math moments is something Meyer believes teachers can learn to do. When they sprout up in his own life, he writes them down. “The more I make a habit out of that, the more ideas I get [and] the more often I see it. It’s definitely disciplinary; it’s not just innate.”\\n\\nAs of this academic year, Meyer is no longer teaching but is instead studying curriculum design in a Ph.D. program at Stanford University. His chief interest right now is the future of professional development. “The research I’m reading is just all unanimous that the current PD slate for teachers is pretty grim,” he says. “It’s not effective, it’s not lasting—the ‘sit-n-get workshop’ they call it. I’m very curious about what’s the best way to support PD online.”\\n\\nThe Internet—specifically his blog, dy/dan—has been pivotal to his own professional success. On the blog, which he started in 2004, he continues to upload an abundance of resources, including videos of his lessons. Meyer says he toyed with the idea of charging for the material, but instead opted to give it all away.\\n\\n“Blogging is not something they told me I should do in teacher-training school,” he says. “It’s just something I started doing as my own little professional development reflection.”\\n\\nThe blog also has been a space for Meyer “to throw some trial balloons out and take some flack.” He writes up both successes and failures, and solicits advice from readers. For instance, after conducting the Orbeez experiment, he posted photos and a procedural explanation, and received dozens of comments in response—several of which came from the brand manager of Orbeez.\\n\\nMeyer sees a wealth of opportunities for other teachers, especially those in remote areas with little access to experts and resources, to utilize Web-based programs for PD. “I’d love to see a clearinghouse for people to upload these kinds of problems in this format, to see that out there on a free basis,” he says, “and to just really toss a few stones at the Goliath of the publishing industry and say, ‘Hey, it can look like this now.’”\\n\\nHaving traded in his role as teacher for that of doctoral student, Meyer has taken some time to reflect on his instructional philosophy. “Be learning in your own life,” he says. “Be solving math problems in your own life. And then figure out ways to bring those into your classroom in as close of a representation as possible to the real thing.” Because the “real thing,” Meyer has realized, is a better hook than any.\\n\\nVol. 04, Issue 02, Page 28\\n\\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\\n\\nBack to Top\",\n",

       " 'Legal scholars, the blogopshere and the twitterati have been scratching their heads for a week following the Obama administration\\'s assertion that it might \"withdraw\" (.pdf) classified documents at the center of a closely watched spy case.\\n\\nSome are wondering whether the feds will use storm-trooper-like tactics to physically remove the data from the case. Others suggest the Obama administration\\'s threats portend a constitutional showdown between the judicial and executive branches.\\n\\nYet strangely enough, the closest legal analogy seemingly pertains to the 1990s litigation surrounding Area 51, the once-secret military waste dump in the Nevada desert.\\n\\nThe spy lawsuit tests whether a U.S. president may bypass Congress, as President George W. Bush did, and establish a program of eavesdropping on Americans without warrants. Bush acknowledged the spy program in 2005, and Congress ratified it in July.\\n\\nThe classified data the administration is threatening to withdraw from the spy case shows that the U.S. government eavesdropped without warrants on the 2004 telephone conversations of two lawyers for a now defunct Saudi charity called the al-Haramain Islamic Foundation that the United States had designated as a terror group.\\n\\nWithout the classified documents, the aggrieved lawyers cannot establish a legal basis to earn them a day in court.\\n\\nThe eavesdropping evidence in the al-Haramain case came to light after the Treasury Department accidentally disclosed it to the plaintiffs in the case. The evidence, which the Bush administration and Obama administration have declared a state secret, has never been made public.\\n\\nThe judge in the case, Vaughn Walker of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, said its admission to the case does not mean it would become a public document. Last week, a federal appeals court sided with Walker\\'s January 5 order.\\n\\nYet, would the Obama administration take a Gestapo-like approach and physically remove the documents without the blessing of the court, as many lawyers and non-lawyers alike have suggested? It\\'s not completely without precedent, and the government could easily block the judge from accessing the documents.\\n\\nThat\\'s because the al-Haramain material remains locked under the control of the Obama administration\\'s Litigation Security Section of the Justice Department, according to the record (.pdf) in the case.\\n\\nAnd days ago, the government acknowledged that, in 2005, it purposely destroyed 92 videotapes (.pdf) to cover up evidence of mistreatment of U.S. terror suspects – evidence the American Civil Liberties Union was trying to bring to light in a New York federal court lawsuit against the Defense Department.\\n\\n\"How paranoid do you want to get? It\\'s totally paranoid to say the government would destroy evidence, but look at what just happened with the CIA,\" said John Strait, a Seattle University constitutional scholar and expert on the Patriot Act. \"The thrust of the Obama administration\\'s argument in al-Haramain is the executive branch controls access to any information that falls within the state-secrets exemption. Therefore, they can do anything they want to pull it out of the case. What they\\'re saying is they get to decide as the executive branch and the court cannot interfere.\"\\n\\nThe Justice Department declined comment.\\n\\nThe state-secrets defense was first recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in a McCarthy-era lawsuit in 1953, and has been increasingly and successfully invoked by federal lawyers seeking to shield the government from court scrutiny. Generally, lawsuits in which national-security information may be divulged are usually tossed by judges at the request of the government –- often by judges who never reviewed any classified data.\\n\\nWalker is believed to be the only judge not to acquiesce to the government\\'s invocation of the privilege. The Bush administration invoked the privilege at least 39 times whereas all other administrations have done so about 16 times.\\n\\nIn the al-Haramain case, the flames of storm-trooping paranoia began whipping about the morning after the Obama administration told Walker on Feb. 27 that it was considering to \"withdraw that information from submission to the court and use in this case.\"\\n\\nJon Eisenberg, the California lawyer for the two attorneys in the case, sent out e-mails to those following the lawsuit, saying:\\n\\nThat\\'s just astounding! It\\'s a not-so-thinly-veiled threat to send Executive Branch authorities (the FBI? the Army?) to Judge Walker\\'s chambers to seize the classified material from his files! In my view, that would be an unprecedented violation of the constitutional separation of powers. I doubt anything like it has happened in the history of this country.\\n\\nIn an interview, Eisenberg said he read the administration\\'s words \"to mean they are going to take back the documents.\"\\n\\nDouglas Kmiec, a Pepperdine School of Law constitutional scholar and President Ronald Reagan\\'s chief attorney under the Office of Legal Counsel, said he has never heard of a lawsuit in which evidence ruled admissible was simply pulled from a case by the government.\\n\\n\"To say there is a body of law that gives good, certain and sufficient guidance on this is to indulge a fabrication,\" Kmiec said. \"The state secrets privilege is as large as the universe at the moment. It\\'s in great need of study and re-examination for purposes of anchoring genuine claims of national security.\"\\n\\nJonathan Turley, a George Washington University legal scholar, agrees with Kmiec. \"I\\'ve never heard of a case where the government withdrew a document considered relevant without the court\\'s permission.\"\\n\\nSuch a proposition, he said, \"is admittedly a gray area.\"\\n\\nTurley, meanwhile, is trying to acquire classified data to learn whether his client, Ali al-Timimi, an Islamic cleric convicted of supporting terror, was illegally spied upon in the United States as part of a bid to win a new trial. Citing a gag order, Turley declined to discuss the al-Timimi case.\\n\\nBut Turley said litigation in the 1990s he was involved in over Area 51 might provide limited legal guidance in the al-Haramain case.\\n\\n\"We had a huge fight over a manual we submitted to the court to prove the existence and presence of hazardous waste,\" Turley said. \"After we submitted it, the government classified it and we were prevented from using it.\"\\n\\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, he said, \"upheld their right to classify the document.\"\\n\\nDespite the storm trooper fantasy, Threat Level suspects the Supreme Court is likely to intervene and resolve the dispute. All of which means a president\\'s power to bypass Congress and secretly eavesdrop on Americans without warrants remains, admittedly, a gray area.\\n\\nPhoto: brcake\\n\\nSee Also:',\n",

       " 'It’s just after 5 o’clock on Saturday and I hustle, as quiet as I can, into the church. I sit in the new section, a 1,500sqft addition that squeezed the last bit of space out of our church’s tiny footprint–making space for our ever-expanding community of parishioners. At more than two thousand registered families we’re the physically smallest parish in our area, but also, by most metrics, the most vibrant. And that’s why I’m here, to speak after Mass about the New Evangelization, about the amazing impact our parish has, and can have, on the community and how a wayward convert from Evangelical Christianity found a home here–and how that makes our parish unique.\\n\\nSometimes it takes somebody from the outside, looking in, to tell us exactly what we’ve got to be grateful for.\\n\\nAt any rate, I’m late as a result of the relentless traffic along my route and I slip into the church as quietly as possible followed by a father and his four children. I quickly find a pew along an outer wall and watch as they ramble around for a bit–the father balancing a carseat on one arm while holding the hand of one of his young sons. Like me, they quickly realize that the nave is full tonight, a packed house and just another one of the reasons for our recent expansion–we’re bursting at the seams. It’s then that the young boy, realizing that they’re doomed to sit with my in the narthex, drops his father’s hand and begins to cry.\\n\\n“I wanna go inside! I wanna go inside!”\\n\\nHis screams echo, I know, all the way up to the altar. The addition exposed some of the original stone church from the 19th century and makes for some beautiful, and sometimes unfortunate, acoustics.\\n\\n“I wanna go inside!” He continued to scream. And I thought, what a beautiful lesson. A child so excited to be as close to Jesus as possible that he can’t possibly fathom having to sit on the outside of the nave, so far away. And if we’d left it there, if that’s all that little boy and his patient father had taught me that night I would’ve been more than satisfied. But it wasn’t.\\n\\nThat we should desire Jesus so fully that having to sit so far away from him is too painful to bear is a beautiful takeaway from our encounter. It reminded me that I need to constant circle back to that child-like faith encouraged by the Apostles and Church Fathers. I need to be vigilant with my prayer life, with the choices that I make and the way I interact with others–that I need to be humble and grateful and, like that little boy, desire a particular closeness with Christ on a daily basis.\\n\\nI would’ve been quite happy had our lesson ended there but, by the grace of God, there was still more to be taught and it came at the end of Communion.\\n\\nIt was a little while after the boy’s first echoing screaming incident that his mother arrived and relieving the father of the carseat and one of the older sons he and the younger son were able to slip quietly into the nave and, I assume, find somewhere to sit. And I didn’t see them again, until the end of Communion.\\n\\nIt was then that I heard a familiar voice–a familiar scream–this time echoing, “I want one, too! I want one, too!” All the way down the aisle and out into the atrium where I was still seated. Then out came the dad and his young son, red-faced from crying and completely inconsolable as he repeated his complaint over and over again between wrenching sobs.\\n\\n“I want one, too! I want one, too!”\\n\\nAnd exchanging a smile with the woman next to me I realized what he meant: He went up for Communion and didn’t get to share in the Eucharist. Didn’t get receive the Host because he must not be old enough yet and hasn’t been confirmed like his older brother and sister. And I imagined what that must’ve felt like for him, and it wasn’t very hard to do.\\n\\nHere was another poignant lesson.\\n\\nAs a non-Catholic Christian I had a very loose grasp of what the Catholic Church taught. As I began to read, research, and meet and speak to Catholics I gradually began to come to understand the beautiful and ancient theology of a Church that traces its roots back to the Apostles themselves. A Church which believes, in sync with a two-thousand year old tradition, that Christ is really present in the Holy Eucharist. That there is something real–a powerful grace–to be received for those that partake.\\n\\nAs an Evangelical Christian I couldn’t have imagined such a closeness with Christ.\\n\\nAnd of course, if we truly understood what was at stake, and what an incredible grace it is for us to receive Jesus–really and truly present–we would scream as well like that little boy at Mass. You’d hardly be able to keep us from storming the altar to receive Communion. We’d never skip Mass again because we’re too tired or busy or otherwise preoccupied. There’s nothing we’d want more in life, I imagine, if we really understood the implications. The blessing and miracle of the thing.\\n\\nSometimes it takes somebody on the outside, like the little boy at Mass, to show us the incredible value and worth of what we’ve had all along. And to remind us to share what we’ve got and pray that the refrain of those that meet us in the course of our daily lives come to see the grace we’ve been given and say, with us, “I want one, too!”',\n",

While your tasks are very much based on building, there’s quite a lot of other stuff going on, with prisoners being fed, showered, and let out into the yard for some exercise, and the guards and so forth going about their business. This fully working prison has a bunch of important things to warn you about what will need to be taken care of later in the game, such as a power grid, and security to keep the prisoners in. The presentation is all fairly minimalistic, with 2D, boxy characters milling about, but it does give the impression that there’s a lot going on. A big prison is a complex system to take care of.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCrucially, I suppose, Prison Architect does have the feel of the classic “Theme” games, and I can see it eating the same sort of mass of hours that Theme Hospitals and their ilk got through. Little dudes milling about, albeit in grim circumstances. (Just as Theme Hospital’s people were sick but cute.) Because of this peculiarly cartoon cheeriness, however, it does not feel like an Introversion game, if that means anything at all to say that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhere.

       " 'Kreisel Electric, a small startup launched by three brothers in Austria, has been making a name for itself in Europe for having retrofitted some popular European-built electric (and non-electric) vehicles with their own battery packs and significantly increasing their range in the process. We reported on their VW e-Golf with a 55 kWh battery pack and Arnold Schwarzenegger’s custom all-electric Mercedes G-Class made by Kreisel.\\n\\nNow the company unveils their latest project: a classic Porsche 910 converted to all-electric with a custom powertrain.\\n\\nFor its previous projects, Kreisel has been trying to get the attention of OEMs and show them that they can make better versions of their vehicles. This project is different since they are actually selling the car.\\n\\nIt’s not cheap: one million Euros ($1,065,000 USD).\\n\\nWhile it’s clearly not for everyone, you can actually get a lot of out it. Of course, you get an all-electric version of a classic Porsche 910. Only 35 units were originally produced and later 4 were rebuilt by EVEX, this is one of them.\\n\\nThe all-electric performance of the car is also impressive thanks to the high-energy density 53 kWh battery pack that they managed to fit in a 1,100 kg (2,400 lbs) car:\\n\\n“The high-performance (lithium-ion) battery pack, with a capacity of 53 kilowatt-hours, which is installed in the Kreisel EVEX 910e, weights 1.100 kilograms and enables a realistic range of 350 kilometres (217 miles). To accommodate the battery system as well as the powertrain in the rear, the frame of the original vehicle was slightly modified. Besides that the air-cooling of the historical vehicle was replaced by a cooling system which Kreisel developed for the high-performance drive.”\\n\\nThose are decent specs and with a 0-100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) time of 2.5 seconds, the vehicle is competitive on the dragstrip with the Tesla Model S P100D Ludicrous. The top speed of 300 km/h (186 mph) is also impressive.\\n\\nAnother interesting feature is the bi-directional charging system that enables the battery pack to act as a home battery pack:\\n\\nThe battery can be charged rapidly with up to 100 kilowatts DC and even enables an intelligent energy management in combination with a photovoltaic installation, for instance on a single-family house: by means of bi-directional charging the sports car can even be used as a home storage and temporarily stores regenerative energy to dispense it back to the house, if required.\\n\\nIt’s particularly useful because the vehicle is clearly not a daily driver and therefore, it’s likely to sit in a garage often.\\n\\nKreisel is showcasing the converted vehicle at the TECHNO-CLASSICA in Essen. Here’s their brochure:',\n",

       " 'OTTAWA — As the Liberal government prepares to table its marijuana legalization bill this week, several ministers walked out of cabinet Tuesday open to sharing their personal experiences with pot.\\n\\nFour years ago, Justin Trudeau told The Huffington Post Canada that he had smoked a joint while he was the MP for Papineau. As he walked by journalists Tuesday, however, he declined to reveal whether he had repeated the experience as prime minister.\\n\\nTransport Minister Marc Garneau speaks to reporters in the foyer of the House of Commons on Parliament Hill on March 21, 2017. (Photo: Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\\n\\nHis transport minister, Marc Garneau, candidly admitted that he had smoked pot when he was a student working on his Ph.D. Did it help him? “I don’t know!” he told reporters.\\n\\nHeritage Minister Mélanie Joly acknowledged smoking marijuana — but before she was elected, she noted.\\n\\nTreasury Board President Scott Brison said he had inhaled marijuana, but not recently. “It was a long time ago,” he said, noting it happened as an adult.\\n\\nBrison said he hoped the government’s bill would make it more difficult for young Canadians to access cannabis. “Right now, the rate of usage of cannabis among young people in Canada is higher than it is in many other countries, so legalization and regulation will actually reduce access,” he said.\\n\\nThe government whip, Pablo Rodriguez, said he used pot a few times as a teenager but did not particularly enjoy the experience. He suggested young people should not follow his example — but if they did, to do so with moderation.\\n\\nHeritage Minister Melanie Joly speaks in the House of Commons on April 6, 2017. (Photo: Fred Chartrand/The Canadian Press)\\n\\nSome ministers laughed off the questions from reporters. National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, for example, walked by with huge smiles when they were asked about their personal pot use.\\n\\nAndrew Leslie, the parliamentary secretary for Canada-U.S. relations, was coy about his experience. “I have not even inhaled it walking down a corridor for about 37 years,” he responded as he walked down a corridor in Parliament’s centre block.\\n\\nLeslie, a former Canadian Forces’ general, declined to say if he had smoked pot before joining the army. “That was a long, long time ago,” he responded.\\n\\nOther ministers, such as International Trade Minister François-Philippe Champagne and International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, said they have never smoked marijuana.\\n\\n\"I’m boring, aren’t I? I’m sorry.\"\\n\\n— International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau\\n\\n“I’ve never taken drugs in my life,” Champagne said.\\n\\nBibeau added: “I’m boring, aren’t I? I’m sorry.”\\n\\nLast year, then foreign affairs minister Stéphane Dion surprised reporters when he said that he couldn’t remember if he’d ever used marijuana. “I don’t remember. I was too loaded,” he joked.\\n\\nThe parliamentary secretary in charge of the pot file and former Toronto police chief, Bill Blair, said he has never experimented with drugs, including marijuana.\\n\\n“I have concerns about the use of this drug and the effect it could have on any of our citizens,” Blair said. “We want to make sure that we restrict the access that children have to it because that’s where the greatest risk is, and for adults, we want to make sure that they can make healthy, safer and socially responsible choices.”\\n\\nFormer police chief Bill Blair is in charge of the pot file. (Photo: Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\\n\\nWhile the Liberals intend to table legislation this week, Blair acknowledged a number of issues still need to be negotiated with the provinces, such as whether federal funds will be provided to help train police officers and how to monitor plant limits for personal use.\\n\\n“There’s going to be a very important discussion that will take place between the federal government, the provinces, territories and municipalities. And I will acknowledge we have a great deal of work to do.”\\n\\nThe Liberals intend to allow adults over the age of majority, which is as young as 18 in six provinces, to legally purchase marijuana. A federal task force recommended a personal possession limit of 30 grams.\\n\\nTranslation and files from Althia Raj\\n\\nSubscribe to our podcast\\n\\nFollow us on Facebook\\n\\nAlso on HuffPost',\n",
       " 'GLASGOW, Scotland — A Church of Scotland chaplain has been sacked from a Glasgow school after describing being gay as a “perversion” and “disorder” during a discussion about marriage equality.\\n\\nReverend Donald Michael MacInnes made the comments on a Facebook page of Glasgow Gaelic School’s, in reference to the Scottish Government’s proposed marriage equality legislation, reported the Evening Times.\\n\\n“The overwhelming support of our Scottish politicians in creating same-sex marriage is very disappointing,” he wrote. “Many of us, myself included, agreed that the creation of civil partnerships was necessary so that individuals suffering from this disorder were not legally penalized in any way because of their sexuality.\\n\\n“We can now expect to see the school curriculum changed to the end that our children will be taught this perversion as if it were a good thing,” added MacInnes.\\n\\nMacInnes’s remarks drew complaints by parents to school and educational authorities.\\n\\nOne parent was quoted as saying: “I don’t want my children exposed to any sort of prejudice from a person in authority and I would not be confident of other views he might express directly to the children.”\\n\\nAnother commented: “Absolutely disgraceful. It is not a disorder, you cannot choose your sexuality.”\\n\\nA spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council stated on Monday that MacInnes was fired from his post: “The man is no longer the Chaplain at the school and this decision was taken by the headteacher as soon as we received the complaints from parents and reviewed the situation.”\\n\\nColin Macfarlane, Director of Stonewall Scotland, told LGBTQ Nation: “Our research shows that 99 per cent of young people in Scottish schools have heard homophobic abuse in the classroom and for a school Chaplin to use such language is a clear breach of their pastoral responsibilities and has no place in our schools.\\n\\nArticle continues below\\n\\n“We are pleased that Glasgow City Council took swift action and sent a clear message that this behavior is not acceptable,” said Macfarlane.\\n\\nTim Hopkins, Director of the Equality Network, a Scottish charity, told LGBTQ Nation: “People are entitled to their views, but not to harm others they have a professional responsibility for.”\\n\\n“It is completely unacceptable for a school chaplain to refer to LGBT people as disordered or perverted, and we welcome that Glasgow Council is taking action on this,” said Hopkins.\\n\\nIn November, Scottish lawmakers overwhelmingly voted for the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill at stage one.\\n\\nIf the bill passes at stage two later this month, the final stage three vote is likely to happen around February, with the queen signing it into law by March.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis Story Filed Under',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump\\'s executive order to ban citizens of seven countries from entering the US has no parallel in American history, says Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security under Barack Obama.\\n\\nKayyem says, usually, there are processes in place to vet executive orders before they\\'re issued — processes the Trump administration declined to follow in favor of a \"disruptive\" management style. But that also meant there weren\\'t any agency officials with advance knowledge of the order who could smooth the implementation hurdles.\\n\\nWithout anyone with a clear sense of the plan, one border agent directed questions to the president himself. It was 24 hours before a judge ruled the order shouldn\\'t apply to those already en route to the US, and another day later before the administration ruled the order did not apply to green card holders.\\n\\nThese are all clear signs that none of the proper authorities, departments, organizations or institutions were contacted, Kayyem says. If they had, she explains, the order would have been more detailed, and exceptions would have been identified. The Pentagon, for example, has been working to bring Iraqi translators and support staff to the US — an effort now frozen by the order.\\n\\nOn Monday, the Pentagon said it was preparing a list of Iraqi translators who should be allowed into the US despite the order.\\n\\nSo why the rush to implement the measures? It\\'s unclear, Kayyem says. She says, as far as she knows, there was no specific threat from any of the seven countries. Many security personnel, 90 percent of whom are non-partisan \"career professionals\" are deeply concerned that the president appears to be acting without advice from his own cabinet, let alone members of the US security community, she adds.\\n\\n\"Make no mistake about it,\" she warns. \"What Donald Trump did has no parallel in American history.\"\\n\\nSo what\\'s next? The courts, Kayyem suggests. But this \"fight,\" as she calls it, is unlikely to stay in the judiciary.\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to see this battle cross branches and departments,\" and, in the end, Kayyem predicts it may just go back to how it was before. That\\'s because, she says, the system wasn\\'t broken in the first place.',\n",
       " 'Details from Australia:\\n\\nAn incident that occurred this week in the North Fawkner parish has left many parishioners shocked. Fr Tomy Kalathoor Mathew was stabbed in the neck, just as he was about to commence the 11am Italian-language Mass at St Matthew’s parish.\\n\\nA 72-year old Fawkner man was arrested last night, and it is believed that he had previously voiced displeasure with the priest’s Indian heritage. Prior to stabbing Fr Mathew, the man accused him of being Hindu or Muslim, and therefore unqualified to say Mass.\\n\\n‘This is appalling behaviour and people should never be treated like this,’ said Shane Healy, Media and Communications director at the Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne. ‘This fellow is doing wonderful work for his parishioners and this is really a blight on the great work that many, many Catholic priests are doing.’']"
